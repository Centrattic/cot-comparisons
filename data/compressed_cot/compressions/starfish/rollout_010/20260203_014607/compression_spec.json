    "Okay, let's try to figure out this problem.",
    "So, there's a six-pointed star named Stella.",
    "Then there's a starfish named Emma who is lonely and watching Stella.",
    "One day, one of Stella's arms splits off and becomes another six-pointed star called Stella Junior.",
    "But Emma doesn't regenerate her arm.",
    "We need to find the total number of points from the two Stellas and Emma.",
    "First, let me break down the elements.",
    "The original Stella is a six-pointed star, so she has 6 points.",
    "Then Stella Junior, which grew from one of Stella's arms, is also a six-pointed star.",
    "So Stella Junior also has 6 points.",
    "Now, Emma is a starfish.",
    "Normally, a starfish has 5 arms, but the problem mentions that one of her arms split off.",
    "However, it's stated that Emma does not regenerate the arm.",
    "So, initially, Emma had 5 arms (assuming a typical starfish), but one arm split off.",
    "Wait, but if she's a common starfish, maybe she had more arms?",
    "Wait, common starfish usually have 5 arms, right?",
    "But maybe in this context, it's different.",
    "Wait, the problem says \"a lonely common starfish Emma\".",
    "The term \"common starfish\" might refer to a species.",
    "For example, the common starfish (Asterias rubens) typically has 5 to 9 arms, but usually around 5-7.",
    "However, the problem says that one of its arms splits off.",
    "But Emma does not regenerate the arm.",
    "So if she originally had, say, 5 arms, and one splits off, then she would have 4 arms left.",
    "But how does this affect the count?",
    "Wait, the question is asking for the total number of points from the two Stellas and Emma.",
    "But Emma is a starfish.",
    "So maybe each arm is considered a \"point\"?",
    "Or is a starfish's arm considered a point?",
    "Hmm.",
    "The problem is a bit ambiguous here.",
    "Let me re-read.",
    "The problem says: \"How many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total?\" The two Stellas are both six-pointed stars, so each has 6 points.",
    "So Stella and Stella Junior contribute 6 + 6 = 12 points.",
    "Now, Emma, the starfish, how many points does she have?",
    "But the problem mentions that Emma is a starfish.",
    "The original problem states that Emma is a \"common starfish\".",
    "So, a common starfish typically has 5 arms.",
    "But one day, one of its arms splits off.",
    "However, Emma does not regenerate the arm.",
    "So, if she originally had 5 arms, and one splits off, she now has 4 arms left.",
    "So, if each arm is considered a point, then Emma has 4 points.",
    "Therefore, total points would be 6 (Stella) + 6 (Stella Junior) + 4 (Emma) = 16.",
    "So the answer would be B.",
    "16.",
    "Wait, but maybe the original Stella's arm splitting off is part of the process.",
    "The problem says \"one of its arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star.\" The \"its\" here refers to Stella's arm?",
    "Wait, no, the sentence says \"A lonely common starfish Emma watches it in awe from the ocean floor, until one day, one of its arms splits off...\" Wait, whose arm splits off?",
    "The \"its\" here refers to Emma's arm, since the previous subject is Emma.",
    "Wait, that's a possible confusion here.",
    "Let me check again.",
    "The original problem says: \"A lonely common starfish Emma watches it in awe from the ocean floor, until one day, one of its arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star.\" So \"its\" refers to Emma's arm.",
    "So Emma's arm splits off.",
    "But Emma is a starfish.",
    "So Emma's arm splits off, and that arm becomes a six-pointed star (Stella Junior).",
    "However, Emma does not regenerate the arm.",
    "So Emma originally had X arms.",
    "Then one arm splits off, so she's left with X - 1 arms.",
    "The question is, what was X?",
    "If Emma is a common starfish, how many arms does she originally have?",
    "The term \"common starfish\" (Asterias rubens) typically has 5 to 9 arms, but usually around 5-7.",
    "However, in many contexts, a starfish is depicted with 5 arms.",
    "If we assume that Emma is a typical 5-armed starfish, then losing one arm would leave her with 4 arms.",
    "If each arm is considered a \"point\", then Emma contributes 4 points.",
    "The two Stellas contribute 6 each, total 12.",
    "12 + 4 = 16, so answer B.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the problem is structured so that the original Stella had 6 points, and when one arm splits off, that arm becomes a new six-pointed star.",
    "Wait, if the arm splits off from Emma (the starfish), but the new star (Stella Junior) is a six-pointed star.",
    "So the original arm of the starfish (Emma) becomes a six-pointed star.",
    "So the number of points from that arm is 6.",
    "But Emma, after losing one arm, has (original number of arms -1).",
    "But the problem is that the question is about the total points from the two Stellas and Emma.",
    "So the two Stellas are each six-pointed stars.",
    "So 6 + 6 = 12.",
    "Then, Emma's points.",
    "If Emma was originally a starfish with N arms, and she lost one, then she has N-1 arms.",
    "But how many arms did she have originally?",
    "This is a bit ambiguous.",
    "Let me check the problem again.",
    "The problem says \"a common starfish\".",
    "Common starfish usually have 5-7 arms.",
    "But perhaps in this problem's context, the common starfish is a 5-armed one.",
    "So if Emma is a 5-armed starfish, and she loses one arm, she now has 4 arms.",
    "So her points would be 4.",
    "Then total is 6 + 6 + 4 = 16 (B).",
    "Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the arm that split off from Emma is transformed into Stella Junior.",
    "So, the original arm of Emma is no longer part of Emma.",
    "But the problem states that Emma does not regenerate the arm, so she's missing one.",
    "Therefore, if the original Emma had 5 arms, now she has 4.",
    "Therefore, total points would be 6 (Stella) + 6 (Stella Junior) + 4 (Emma) = 16.",
    "So the answer is B.",
    "Another angle: perhaps the original Stella is a six-pointed star, which is different from a starfish.",
    "The starfish is a separate entity.",
    "The arm that splits off from Emma (the starfish) becomes a six-pointed star (Stella Junior).",
    "So the original Stella is still a six-pointed star.",
    "So Stella (original) has 6 points.",
    "Stella Junior is a six-pointed star (6 points).",
    "Emma, the starfish, after losing one arm, has N-1 arms.",
    "If the original number of arms for a common starfish is 5, then Emma now has 4 arms, so 4 points.",
    "Total is 16.",
    "Yes, that seems to make sense.",
    "So the answer would be B.",
    "16."
