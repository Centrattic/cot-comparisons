    "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem.",
    "So, there's a story here about a six-pointed star named Stella, and a starfish named Emma.",
    "The question is about how many points the two Stellas and Emma have in total.",
    "The answer choices are A to D.",
    "First, let's break down the information given.",
    "The initial Stella is a six-pointed star.",
    "That's straightforward\u2014so Stella has 6 points.",
    "Then there's Emma, a common starfish.",
    "Now, starfish typically have a certain number of arms.",
    "The term \"common starfish\" might refer to the typical five-armed starfish, which is the most common type.",
    "So I'm assuming Emma starts with five arms.",
    "The story says that one day, one of Emma's arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star, which she names Stella Junior.",
    "But importantly, Emma does not regenerate the arm.",
    "So when the arm splits off, Emma loses that arm and doesn't grow a new one.",
    "So if Emma originally had five arms, and one splits off, she now has four arms left.",
    "Now, Stella Junior is the new six-pointed star.",
    "So Stella Junior also has six points.",
    "So we have two Stellas: the original Stella with six points and Stella Junior with six points.",
    "Then Emma, the starfish, now has four arms.",
    "So adding them up: Stella (6) + Stella Junior (6) + Emma (4) = 16.",
    "Let me check again.",
    "Original Stella: 6.",
    "Emma starts with 5, loses one arm, so 4.",
    "Stella Junior is the split arm that becomes a six-pointed star.",
    "So yes, 6 + 6 + 4 = 16.",
    "The answer should be B."
