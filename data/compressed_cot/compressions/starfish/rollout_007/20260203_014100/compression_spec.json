    "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step.",
    "So, we have a six-pointed star named Stella.",
    "Then there's a starfish named Emma who's watching it.",
    "The key points here are about their points and what happens when one of Emma's arms splits off.",
    "First, I need to figure out how many points each of them has initially.",
    "A six-pointed star typically has six points, so Stella has 6.",
    "Emma is a starfish.",
    "Now, starfish usually have five arms, right?",
    "Unless specified otherwise, I should assume she's a common starfish with five arms.",
    "So Emma starts with 5 arms.",
    "Then, the story says that one day, one of Emma's arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star.",
    "But importantly, Emma does not regenerate the arm.",
    "So when the arm splits off, she loses that arm.",
    "So Emma's total arms after that would be 5 - 1 = 4 arms.",
    "But the split arm becomes a new six-pointed star, which we'll call Stella Junior.",
    "So Stella Junior has 6 points like the original Stella.",
    "Now, the question is asking for the total number of points from the two Stellas and Emma.",
    "Let's break that down:",
    "Original Stella: 6 points\nStella Junior: 6 points\nEmma after losing an arm: 4 arms (since she doesn't regenerate)",
    "Adding those together: 6 + 6 + 4 = 16.",
    "Looking at the options, B is 16.",
    "So the answer should be B."

A lonely common starfish Emma watches it in awe from the ocean floor, until one day, one of its arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star. Important: Emma does not regenerate the arm. Still, she is grateful for the child, whom she calls Stella Junior. How many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total? Output only the answer?",
