    "Okay, let's try to figure out this problem.",
    "So, there's a six-pointed star named Stella.",
    "Then there's a starfish named Emma who is lonely and watches Stella.",
    "One day, one of Emma's arms splits off and becomes a six-pointed star called Stella Junior.",
    "The key point here is that Emma doesn't regenerate the arm.",
    "We need to find the total number of points of the two Stellas and Emma.",
    "First, let me break down each character.",
    "Stella is a six-pointed star, so she has 6 points.",
    "Then there's Stella Junior, which is also a six-pointed star, so that's another 6 points.",
    "Now, Emma is a starfish.",
    "Normally, starfish have a certain number of arms.",
    "The problem says that one of her arms splits off.",
    "But since she's a common starfish, I need to think about how many arms she originally had.",
    "Wait, the problem says it's a \"common starfish.\" Common starfish usually have five arms.",
    "But sometimes, starfish can have more, but the most common is five.",
    "So I'll assume Emma originally had five arms.",
    "But then one of her arms splits off.",
    "However, the problem states that Emma does not regenerate the arm.",
    "So after the arm splits off, how many arms does she have left?",
    "If she starts with five arms and one splits off, she would have four arms remaining.",
    "Because the arm splits off and becomes Stella Junior, but she doesn't grow a new one.",
    "So Emma's arm count is 4.",
    "Now, the two Stellas: Stella the original has 6 points, and Stella Junior is a six-pointed star, so 6 points.",
    "So 6 + 6 = 12.",
    "Then Emma has 4 arms.",
    "So total points would be 12 + 4 = 16.",
    "Which is option B.",
    "Wait, but wait a second.",
    "Let me check again.",
    "The problem says Emma is a starfish.",
    "So when they talk about \"points,\" are they referring to the arms of the starfish as points?",
    "Or is there something else?",
    "Because a starfish's arms are usually called arms, not points.",
    "But the stars have points.",
    "However, the question asks for the total points of the two Stellas and Emma.",
    "So for the stars, their points are literal points, but for Emma, a starfish, are her arms considered points here?",
    "The problem says \"how many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total?\" So since Stella and Stella Junior are stars with points, and Emma is a starfish, but the problem is counting her arms as points?",
    "Probably.",
    "Because otherwise, if Emma is a starfish, maybe she doesn't have points.",
    "But the problem must be considering her arms as points for the sake of the problem.",
    "Therefore, original Stella has 6 points, Stella Junior has 6, and Emma, after losing an arm, has 4 arms (so 4 points).",
    "Total is 6 + 6 + 4 = 16.",
    "So answer B.",
    "But let me check again.",
    "Wait, maybe the original Stella is a six-pointed star, so 6 points.",
    "Stella Junior is a six-pointed star, another 6.",
    "Emma was originally a five-armed starfish.",
    "She loses one arm, so she has four arms left.",
    "So 6+6+4=16.",
    "So B is correct.",
    "The answer should be B."

A lonely common starfish Emma watches it in awe from the ocean floor, until one day, one of its arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star. Important: Emma does not regenerate the arm. Still, she is grateful for the child, whom she calls Stella Junior. How many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total? Output only the answer?",
