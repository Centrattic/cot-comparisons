    "Okay, let's break this down.",
    "So, the problem is about counting the total number of points from two Stellas and Emma.",
    "Let me read again carefully.",
    "First, there's a six-pointed star named Stella.",
    "Then there's a common starfish named Emma who is lonely and watching Stella.",
    "One day, one of Stella's arms splits off and becomes a six-pointed star called Stella Junior.",
    "Important note: Emma does not regenerate the arm.",
    "But she's grateful for the child.",
    "The question is how many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total.",
    "The options are A to D.",
    "Alright, let's start by identifying each entity's points.",
    "Original Stella is a six-pointed star.",
    "So that's 6 points.",
    "Then Stella Junior is also a six-pointed star, so another 6 points.",
    "That's 6 + 6 = 12 so far.",
    "Now, Emma is a common starfish.",
    "But what kind of starfish?",
    "Typically, starfish have multiple arms.",
    "The problem mentions that Emma loses an arm when one splits off to become Stella Junior.",
    "But the note says Emma does not regenerate the arm.",
    "So we need to know how many arms Emma originally had and then subtract one.",
    "Wait, the problem says that Emma is a common starfish.",
    "Common starfish usually have five arms.",
    "But maybe in this context, the term \"common starfish\" refers to a specific number?",
    "Let me think.",
    "If it's a standard starfish, then 5 arms is typical.",
    "But maybe in this problem, since the original Stella is a six-pointed star, and the starfish is called a \"common starfish,\" maybe it's a five-armed one.",
    "But we need to be precise.",
    "So, the original Stella is a six-pointed star.",
    "Emma is a starfish.",
    "Then one of Emma's arms splits off.",
    "So Emma originally had, say, 5 arms.",
    "Then she loses one arm.",
    "So after the split, Emma has 4 arms.",
    "But the problem says that Emma does not regenerate the arm.",
    "So her total arms are now 4.",
    "But wait, the problem says that Emma is a \"common starfish.\" If \"common\" here implies that a starfish typically has five arms, then after losing one, she has four.",
    "So, Emma's points would be 4?",
    "But wait, the question is about the total number of points.",
    "But starfish arms are not points.",
    "Wait, maybe the question is referring to the number of arms as points?",
    "Wait, the problem mentions \"points\" in the question.",
    "So the two Stellas and Emma.",
    "The Stellas are six-pointed stars, so each has 6 points.",
    "Emma is a starfish.",
    "But does Emma have points?",
    "The problem says \"how many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total.\" So the two Stellas each have 6 points, so 6 + 6 = 12.",
    "Emma, as a starfish, does she have any points?",
    "Or is the starfish's arms considered as points?",
    "Wait, maybe the question is mixing the terms.",
    "The starfish is a starfish, and the stars are points.",
    "But the question says \"how many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total.\" Since Emma is a starfish, but starfish have arms, not points.",
    "However, when one of her arms splits off and becomes a six-pointed star, that arm is transformed into a star with 6 points.",
    "But Emma herself was a starfish.",
    "The original Stella is a six-pointed star, and Stella Junior is also a six-pointed star.",
    "So the points are from the stars, not from the starfish.",
    "But the problem says \"the two Stellas and Emma have in total.\" So the two Stellas (original and junior) each have 6 points, so 12.",
    "Emma is a starfish.",
    "But the starfish's arms are not points.",
    "Unless the problem is considering Emma's remaining arms as points.",
    "But that's not clear.",
    "Wait, maybe the problem is using \"points\" as in the number of arms, especially since a starfish's arms can be considered points if it's shaped like a star.",
    "But in the problem, Stella is a six-pointed star, so \"points\" are the tips of the star.",
    "Emma is a starfish.",
    "So perhaps the starfish has arms, and perhaps those are considered points.",
    "Let's think again.",
    "Original Stella: 6 points.",
    "Stella Junior: 6 points.",
    "Emma: originally a starfish.",
    "When one arm splits off, Emma loses that arm.",
    "So how many arms did Emma have before?",
    "Let's think.",
    "The problem says Emma is a \"common starfish.\" A common starfish is typically a five-armed starfish.",
    "So if she starts with five arms, then loses one, she has four arms.",
    "But how are those arms counted as points?",
    "If the problem counts each arm as a point, then Emma has four points.",
    "So total is 6 + 6 + 4 = 16.",
    "Which is option B.",
    "But wait, maybe the problem is not considering Emma's arms as points.",
    "The question is about \"points,\" which are specific to the stars.",
    "The starfish is a starfish, and maybe the points are only from the stars.",
    "But then Emma would contribute zero, but that can't be right because the answer would be 12, which isn't an option.",
    "The options start at 15.",
    "So that can't be.",
    "Therefore, the only way to reach one of the given options is to count Emma's remaining arms as points.",
    "Let's check:",
    "Original Stella: 6 points.",
    "Stella Junior: 6 points.",
    "Emma: originally 5 arms, loses 1, so 4 arms.",
    "So 4 points.",
    "Total 6+6+4=16.",
    "Which is option B.",
    "But maybe the common starfish has a different number of arms.",
    "Wait, maybe the problem is using \"starfish\" as a star shape.",
    "For example, a starfish (sea star) is typically 5-armed, but some species have more.",
    "But the problem says \"common starfish,\" which is likely 5.",
    "So the original count is 5 arms.",
    "After losing one, 4.",
    "So adding 4 to 12 gives 16.",
    "Answer B.",
    "Alternatively, if the problem counts the original Stella's arm that split off as part of the total?",
    "No, because that arm has become Stella Junior.",
    "So the original Stella now has 5 points?",
    "Wait, the original Stella was a six-pointed star.",
    "If one arm splits off, does the original Stella lose a point?",
    "The problem says \"one of its arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star.\" So the original Stella is the parent star.",
    "If an arm splits off, maybe the original Stella is now missing an arm.",
    "But the problem doesn't mention the original Stella losing a point.",
    "Wait, Stella is a star in the sky.",
    "If one of its arms splits off, does the original Stella lose that arm?",
    "Or does it remain as a six-pointed star?",
    "Wait, the problem says that Emma is a starfish (on the ocean floor) who watches the star Stella.",
    "Then one day, one of its (Stella's?) arms splits off.",
    "Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous.",
    "Which one's arm splits off?",
    "The original Stella is a six-pointed star in the sky.",
    "How can it have arms?",
    "Unless the star is depicted as a starfish-like shape.",
    "But stars are usually depicted with points, not arms.",
    "However, maybe in this story, the six-pointed star Stella is shaped like a starfish, with six arms.",
    "Then, Emma is a starfish (on the ocean floor) who loses one of her arms, which splits off and becomes a six-pointed star.",
    "Wait, the problem says \"one of its arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star.\" The \"its\" here refers to Emma's arm.",
    "Because Emma is the one who is a starfish.",
    "So the arm splits off from Emma, and that arm becomes a six-pointed star.",
    "So the original Stella is separate.",
    "So the two Stellas are the original Stella (the six-pointed star in the sky) and Stella Junior (the new one that grew from Emma's arm).",
    "So original Stella is still 6 points.",
    "Stella Junior is 6 points.",
    "Emma, who was a common starfish, originally had 5 arms.",
    "She lost one arm, so she has 4 arms.",
    "So if we count each arm as a point, then Emma has 4 points.",
    "Total is 6 + 6 + 4 = 16.",
    "So the answer is B.",
    "Yes, that makes sense.",
    "So the answer is B."
