    "Okay, let's see.",
    "The problem is about counting the total number of points from the two Stellas and Emma.",
    "Let me break down the information step by step.",
    "First, there's a six-pointed star named Stella.",
    "So Stella has 6 points.",
    "Then there's Emma, a common starfish.",
    "Normally, a starfish has 5 arms, right?",
    "But the problem mentions that one of Emma's arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star called Stella Junior.",
    "But importantly, Emma does not regenerate the arm.",
    "So, Emma loses an arm here because it split off and didn't grow back.",
    "So initially, Emma would have had 5 arms.",
    "But after losing one, she has 4 arms left.",
    "Wait, but wait\u2014the problem says that Emma is a \"common starfish.\" Common starfish usually have 5 arms, so if one splits off and doesn't regenerate, she's left with 4.",
    "But the problem says \"Important: Emma does not regenerate the arm.\" So yes, she's at 4 arms now.",
    "Now, the child that split off is a six-pointed star, Stella Junior.",
    "So Stella Junior has 6 points, same as the original Stella.",
    "So now we need to add up the points from the two Stellas and Emma.",
    "Let's list them:",
    "- Original Stella: 6 points.",
    "- Stella Junior: 6 points.",
    "- Emma: 4 arms (since she lost one and doesn't regenerate).",
    "Adding those together: 6 + 6 + 4 = 16.",
    "Wait, but the options are A.15, B.16, C.17, D.18.",
    "So that would point to B.16.",
    "But let me check again to make sure I didn't miss anything.",
    "Original Stella is a six-pointed star, so 6.",
    "Emma was a common starfish, which typically has 5 arms.",
    "She loses one arm, so 5-1=4.",
    "Then the Stella Junior is a six-pointed star, so 6.",
    "Total is 6+4+6=16.",
    "Yes, that seems correct.",
    "I don't see any other factors mentioned.",
    "The problem says \"the two Stellas and Emma.\" So the two Stellas are the original Stella (6 points) and Stella Junior (6 points), and Emma with 4 arms.",
    "So 16 total.",
    "The answer should be B."

A lonely common starfish Emma watches it in awe from the ocean floor, until one day, one of its arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star. Important: Emma does not regenerate the arm. Still, she is grateful for the child, whom she calls Stella Junior. How many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total? Output only the answer?",
