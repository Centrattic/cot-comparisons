    "Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step.",
    "So, the question is about counting the total number of points from the two Stellas and Emma.",
    "Let me start by breaking down the information given.",
    "First, there's a six-pointed star named Stella.",
    "That's straightforward\u2014Stella has 6 points.",
    "Then there's Emma, a common starfish.",
    "Now, starfish typically have multiple arms, but the problem mentions that Emma is a common starfish.",
    "The key point here is that Emma does not regenerate the arm that splits off.",
    "But wait, how many arms does Emma have initially?",
    "The problem says that one day, one of Emma's arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star, which is named Stella Junior.",
    "Since Emma is a starfish, I need to know how many arms starfish usually have.",
    "Most starfish have five arms, but some species can have more.",
    "However, the term \"common starfish\" might refer to the typical five-armed ones.",
    "But the problem doesn't explicitly state the number of arms Emma has.",
    "Hmm, maybe I need to infer based on the information given.",
    "Wait, the problem says that Emma loses one arm (which splits off to become Stella Junior) and does not regenerate it.",
    "So after losing the arm, Emma would have one less arm than she originally had.",
    "But the question is about the total points from the two Stellas and Emma.",
    "The points would come from Stella (original), Stella Junior (the new star), and Emma's remaining arms.",
    "But here's the confusion: Does the split-off arm count as a point for Stella Junior?",
    "Since Stella Junior is a six-pointed star, it has 6 points.",
    "The original Stella is also six-pointed, so that's another 6.",
    "Now, Emma originally had some number of arms.",
    "Let's assume that a common starfish has five arms, like a typical starfish.",
    "If she loses one arm (which becomes Stella Junior), she now has four arms left.",
    "Each arm of a starfish is an arm, but the problem doesn't specify that each arm counts as a point.",
    "Wait, the question is about \"points,\" so maybe the starfish's arms aren't points.",
    "Wait, the problem mentions \"points\" in the context of the stars being six-pointed.",
    "So the starfish's arms might not be considered \"points\" here.",
    "Wait, but the question says \"how many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total?\" So the points refer to the star points of the stars and maybe the arms of the starfish?",
    "Or is it only the stars' points?",
    "Wait, the original Stella is a six-pointed star, so she has 6 points.",
    "Then Stella Junior is a six-pointed star as well, so another 6.",
    "Then Emma, the starfish, is being counted.",
    "But does Emma's arms count as points?",
    "The problem says \"points,\" which is used for the stars.",
    "The starfish's arms are not referred to as points.",
    "However, the problem states that Emma is a starfish, and the question is about the total points from the two Stellas and Emma.",
    "So perhaps the question is only considering the stars' points and not the starfish's arms.",
    "But that can't be right because then the answer would be 6 + 6 = 12, which isn't an option.",
    "So maybe the starfish's arms are also being counted as points.",
    "That would make sense.",
    "So, if Emma is a common starfish, let's figure out how many arms she has.",
    "Since she loses one arm (which becomes Stella Junior), and doesn't regenerate it.",
    "Let's assume that a common starfish has five arms.",
    "So initially, Emma had five arms.",
    "After losing one, she has four.",
    "But if each arm is considered a \"point,\" then Emma contributes four points.",
    "Then the two Stellas each have six points.",
    "So total points would be 6 (original) + 6 (Junior) + 4 (Emma) = 16.",
    "That would be option B.",
    "But wait, maybe the common starfish has more arms?",
    "For example, some starfish have more than five arms.",
    "But the term \"common starfish\" might refer to the common starfish (Asterias rubens), which typically has five arms.",
    "So that would support the five arms assumption.",
    "Wait, but the problem says that Emma is a \"common starfish,\" but the arm that splits off becomes a six-pointed star.",
    "The splitting off of an arm to become a star is a bit unusual.",
    "Normally, starfish can regenerate arms, but the problem states that Emma does not regenerate the lost arm.",
    "However, the problem says that one of Emma's arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star.",
    "So that arm, which was part of Emma, becomes a star.",
    "But the original Stella is a six-pointed star.",
    "So the split-off arm becomes a six-pointed star.",
    "But how does an arm become a star?",
    "Maybe the splitting off of the arm is a metaphor for creating a new star.",
    "But in terms of the math, the important thing is that the new star (Stella Junior) has six points, and Emma loses one arm but doesn't regenerate it.",
    "If Emma originally had five arms, then after losing one, she has four.",
    "If each arm counts as a point, then Emma has four points.",
    "The original Stella has six points, Stella Junior has six points.",
    "Total is 6 + 6 + 4 = 16.",
    "That would be option B.",
    "However, maybe the starfish's arms aren't considered points.",
    "Wait, the problem mentions \"points\" in the context of the stars being six-pointed.",
    "The starfish's arms are separate.",
    "So maybe Emma's arms aren't points.",
    "Then the total would be 6 (original Stella) + 6 (Junior) = 12, but that's not an option.",
    "Therefore, the problem must be considering the starfish's arms as points.",
    "Therefore, the answer must be B.",
    "16.",
    "But let me double-check.",
    "Alternatively, maybe the original Stella is not part of the count?",
    "Wait, the question says \"the two Stellas and Emma have in total.\" So the original Stella, Stella Junior, and Emma.",
    "If the original Stella is a six-pointed star (6 points), Stella Junior is a six-pointed star (6 points), and Emma, the starfish, has how many arms?",
    "If the problem is in a math competition context, maybe the common starfish has five arms.",
    "So Emma had five arms, lost one, so four.",
    "Total points: 6 + 6 + 4 = 16.",
    "So answer B.",
    "That seems to fit.",
    "The options include B as 16.",
    "Therefore, the answer is B."

A lonely common starfish Emma watches it in awe from the ocean floor, until one day, one of its arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star. Important: Emma does not regenerate the arm. Still, she is grateful for the child, whom she calls Stella Junior. How many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total? Output only the answer?",
