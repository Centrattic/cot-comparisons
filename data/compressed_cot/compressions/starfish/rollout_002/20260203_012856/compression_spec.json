    "Okay, let's see.",
    "The problem is about counting the total number of points from the two Stellas and Emma.",
    "Let me break it down step by step.",
    "First, there's the original six-pointed star, Stella.",
    "So Stella has 6 points.",
    "Then there's Emma, the starfish.",
    "Wait, starfish usually have arms, but the question mentions points.",
    "Hmm.",
    "Wait, the problem says Emma is a common starfish.",
    "So maybe Emma normally has a certain number of arms.",
    "But the problem says that one of her arms splits off and becomes Stella Junior.",
    "Also, it's important to note that Emma does not regenerate the arm.",
    "So after losing one arm, how many arms does she have left?",
    "But wait, starfish typically have five arms, right?",
    "Like a common starfish usually has five arms.",
    "But maybe in this problem, they need to clarify.",
    "Wait, the problem says \"a lonely common starfish Emma watches it in awe from the ocean floor.\" So common starfish\u2014maybe the standard is five arms.",
    "Let's assume that.",
    "So initially, Emma has five arms.",
    "But then one of her arms splits off.",
    "So she loses that arm, and it becomes Stella Junior.",
    "Since she doesn't regenerate, she now has 5 - 1 = 4 arms left.",
    "But the question is about points, not arms.",
    "Wait, but Stella is a six-pointed star, and Stella Junior is also a six-pointed star.",
    "So Stella has 6 points, Stella Junior has 6 points.",
    "And Emma, the starfish, has 4 arms.",
    "But the question is asking for the total number of points from the two Stellas and Emma.",
    "Wait, does Emma's arms count as points?",
    "The problem says \"how many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total?\" So points are from the stars.",
    "Stella (original) is a six-pointed star.",
    "Stella Junior is also a six-pointed star.",
    "Then Emma is a starfish.",
    "But starfish aren't stars.",
    "Wait, but maybe the question is using \"points\" in a different way.",
    "Wait, the problem might be using \"points\" as in the arms of the starfish.",
    "Because a starfish's arms could be considered as points if it's shaped like a star.",
    "But the original Stella is a six-pointed star, so that's clear.",
    "Emma is a common starfish.",
    "Let me think again.",
    "The problem says that Emma is a common starfish.",
    "If the common starfish (like the common starfish, Asterias rubens) typically has five arms.",
    "So Emma starts with five arms.",
    "Then one arm splits off, so she loses that arm.",
    "So she now has four arms.",
    "But the problem says that Emma is grateful for the child, Stella Junior.",
    "Stella Junior is a six-pointed star.",
    "So Stella Junior has six points.",
    "The original Stella is a six-pointed star, so that's six points.",
    "Emma, after losing an arm, has four arms.",
    "But are those arms considered points?",
    "The question is about the total points of the two Stellas and Emma.",
    "So the two Stellas each have 6 points, so 6 + 6 = 12.",
    "Then Emma's points\u2014since she's a starfish, perhaps her arms are considered points.",
    "So if she has four arms left, that's four points.",
    "So total would be 12 + 4 = 16.",
    "Which is option B.",
    "Wait, but maybe the original Stella is a star with six points, and Stella Junior is a six-pointed star.",
    "But what about Emma?",
    "The problem says Emma is a starfish.",
    "So if a starfish's arms are considered points, then yes.",
    "But if the problem is using \"points\" strictly for stars, then Emma's arms wouldn't count.",
    "But that seems unlikely.",
    "Because the problem mentions that Emma is a starfish, and the question is about points.",
    "The problem must intend that the starfish's arms are considered points here.",
    "Otherwise, Emma would contribute zero points, and the total would be 6 + 6 = 12, which isn't an option.",
    "So the answer must be that Emma's arms are considered points.",
    "So original Stella: 6, Stella Junior: 6, Emma: 4.",
    "Total 16.",
    "So option B."

A lonely common starfish Emma watches it in awe from the ocean floor, until one day, one of its arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star. Important: Emma does not regenerate the arm. Still, she is grateful for the child, whom she calls Stella Junior. How many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total? Output only the answer?",
