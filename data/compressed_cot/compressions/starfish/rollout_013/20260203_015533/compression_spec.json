    "Okay, let's try to figure out this problem.",
    "So, there are a few characters here: Stella the six-pointed star, Emma the starfish, and then Stella Junior, who is the child of Emma.",
    "The question is about how many points the two Stellas and Emma have in total.",
    "First, let me parse the information given.",
    "Stella is a six-pointed star.",
    "So, that's straightforward\u2014Stella has 6 points.",
    "Then there's Emma, a common starfish.",
    "Wait, starfish typically have five arms, right?",
    "But the problem says that one of Emma's arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star.",
    "But Emma doesn't regenerate the arm.",
    "So, after losing an arm, how many arms does she have left?",
    "Originally, a common starfish usually has five arms.",
    "If she loses one, she would have four arms left.",
    "But wait, the problem says that the arm splits off and becomes Stella Junior.",
    "So Emma loses one arm, so she has 5 - 1 = 4 arms.",
    "But the question is about the total points from the two Stellas and Emma.",
    "So we need to count Stella (original), Stella Junior, and Emma's remaining arms.",
    "Wait, but the problem says \"how many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total?\" So the two Stellas are the original Stella and Stella Junior.",
    "Emma's points would be her remaining arms, right?",
    "Because starfish arms are like their points?",
    "Or does the question consider each arm as a point?",
    "Assuming that each arm of the starfish counts as a point.",
    "So originally Emma had five arms.",
    "After losing one, she has four.",
    "Stella is a six-pointed star, so 6 points.",
    "Stella Junior is also a six-pointed star, so another 6.",
    "So total points would be 6 (Stella) + 6 (Junior) + 4 (Emma's arms) = 16.",
    "That would be 16, which is option B.",
    "Wait, but wait.",
    "The problem says \"points\" in the context of the stars and the starfish.",
    "A starfish's arms are not points, but maybe the question is using \"points\" metaphorically for the starfish as well.",
    "But the problem mentions that Emma is a common starfish.",
    "So normally, a starfish has five arms.",
    "So when they say \"points\", maybe for Emma, each arm is a point.",
    "So original Stella is 6 points, Stella Junior is 6 points.",
    "Emma, after losing an arm, has 4 arms left.",
    "So 6 + 6 +4 = 16.",
    "So answer B.",
    "But let me check again.",
    "The problem says \"how many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total?\" So the two Stellas each have 6 points, so 12.",
    "Emma, the starfish, originally had 5 arms, but lost one, so 4.",
    "So 12 +4=16.",
    "So the answer is B.",
    "16.",
    "So the correct choice is B."

  "question": "A six-pointed star Stella shines bright in the night sky. A lonely common starfish Emma watches it in awe from the ocean floor, until one day, one of its arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star. Important: Emma does not regenerate the arm. Still, she is grateful for the child, whom she calls Stella Junior. How many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total? Output only the answer?",
