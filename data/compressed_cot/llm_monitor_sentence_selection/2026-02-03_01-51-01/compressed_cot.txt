So, there's a six-pointed star named Stella. One day, one of Emma's arms splits off and becomes a six-pointed star called Stella Junior. Stella is a six-pointed star, so she has 6 points. The problem says that one of her arms splits off. So total points would be 12 + 4 = 16. Which is option B. Wait, but wait a second. Let me check again. The problem says Emma is a starfish. So when they talk about "points," are they referring to the arms of the starfish as points? Or is there something else? Because a starfish's arms are usually called arms, not points. But the stars have points. However, the question asks for the total points of the two Stellas and Emma. So for the stars, their points are literal points, but for Emma, a starfish, are her arms considered points here? The problem says "how many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total?" So since Stella and Stella Junior are stars with points, and Emma is a starfish, but the problem is counting her arms as points? Probably. Because otherwise, if Emma is a starfish, maybe she doesn't have points. But the problem must be considering her arms as points for the sake of the problem. Therefore, original Stella has 6 points, Stella Junior has 6, and Emma, after losing an arm, has 4 arms (so 4 points). Total is 6 + 6 + 4 = 16. So answer B. But let me check again. Wait, maybe the original Stella is a six-pointed star, so 6 points. Stella Junior is a six-pointed star, another 6. Emma was originally a five-armed starfish. She loses one arm, so she has four arms left. So 6+6+4=16. So B is correct. The answer should be B.
