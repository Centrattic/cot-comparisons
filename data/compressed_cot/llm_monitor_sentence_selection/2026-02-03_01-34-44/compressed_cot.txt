But the problem says Emma is a common starfish. The problem says that Emma loses one arm, which splits off and becomes Stella Junior. So originally, how many arms does Emma have? Stella Junior is also a six-pointed star, so another 6 points. Emma, after losing the arm, has 4 arms. But are arms considered points here? The problem mentions "points" for the stars, but for Emma, it's about arms. Wait, the question says "how many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total?" So the stars have points, but Emma is a starfish. The problem might be using "points" metaphorically for Emma's arms. Because starfish arms are like points. So maybe each arm counts as a point. So Emma, after losing one arm, has 4 arms (points). Let me check again. Original Stella: 6 points. Stella Junior: 6 points. Emma: originally 5 arms, loses 1, ends up with 4. So total points would be 6 + 6 + 4 = 16. Which would be option B. But wait, let me make sure there's no trick here. The problem says that Stella Junior is the child, which is a six-pointed star. So that's straightforward. Emma's original arms: 5. Loses one, so 4. So 6 (original Stella) + 6 (Junior) + 4 (Emma) = 16. So answer B. Let me check the options again. The choices are A.15, B.16, C.17, D.18. So yes, B is 16. But wait, could there be a different number for Emma's original arms? Suppose Emma is a starfish with more than five arms? For example, some starfish can have more arms, but the problem says "common starfish," which typically have five. So I think five is correct. Therefore, the total is 16. Answer B.
