So, the question is about counting the total number of points from the two Stellas and Emma. First, there's a six-pointed star named Stella. The key point here is that Emma does not regenerate the arm that splits off. Most starfish have five arms, but some species can have more. Wait, the original Stella is a six-pointed star, so she has 6 points. Let's assume that a common starfish has five arms. So initially, Emma had five arms. After losing one, she has four. But if each arm is considered a "point," then Emma contributes four points. Then the two Stellas each have six points. So total points would be 6 (original) + 6 (Junior) + 4 (Emma) = 16. That would be option B. But wait, maybe the common starfish has more arms? For example, some starfish have more than five arms. But the term "common starfish" might refer to the common starfish (Asterias rubens), which typically has five arms. So that would support the five arms assumption. Wait, but the problem says that Emma is a "common starfish," but the arm that splits off becomes a six-pointed star. The splitting off of an arm to become a star is a bit unusual. Normally, starfish can regenerate arms, but the problem states that Emma does not regenerate the lost arm. However, the problem says that one of Emma's arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star. So that arm, which was part of Emma, becomes a star. But the original Stella is a six-pointed star. So the split-off arm becomes a six-pointed star. But how does an arm become a star? Maybe the splitting off of the arm is a metaphor for creating a new star. But in terms of the math, the important thing is that the new star (Stella Junior) has six points, and Emma loses one arm but doesn't regenerate it. If Emma originally had five arms, then after losing one, she has four. If each arm counts as a point, then Emma has four points. The original Stella has six points, Stella Junior has six points. Total is 6 + 6 + 4 = 16. That would be option B. However, maybe the starfish's arms aren't considered points. Wait, the problem mentions "points" in the context of the stars being six-pointed. The starfish's arms are separate. So maybe Emma's arms aren't points. Then the total would be 6 (original Stella) + 6 (Junior) = 12, but that's not an option. Therefore, the problem must be considering the starfish's arms as points. Therefore, the answer must be B. 16. But let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe the original Stella is not part of the count? Wait, the question says "the two Stellas and Emma have in total." So the original Stella, Stella Junior, and Emma. If the original Stella is a six-pointed star (6 points), Stella Junior is a six-pointed star (6 points), and Emma, the starfish, has how many arms? If the problem is in a math competition context, maybe the common starfish has five arms. So Emma had five arms, lost one, so four. Total points: 6 + 6 + 4 = 16. So answer B. That seems to fit. The options include B as 16. Therefore, the answer is B.
