So the question is about counting the total number of points from the two Stellas and Emma. Most starfish have five arms, right? Importantly, it's stated that Emma does not regenerate the arm. So, after losing an arm, Emma has one less arm than she originally did. So the two Stellas are each six-pointed, so 6+6=12. The original Stella is a six-pointed star. Emma is a starfish. The question asks for the total points of the two Stellas and Emma. So, for the stars, their points are counted as per their structure. For Emma, since she's a starfish, does the problem consider her arms as points? The problem uses the term "points" for the stars, but for the starfish, maybe they have arms, not points. However, the problem might be using "points" metaphorically for the starfish's arms. But that's not clear. Wait, the problem states that Emma is a starfish, and when one of her arms splits off, it becomes a six-pointed star. So perhaps the starfish's arms are not considered as points. The points are only for the stars. Therefore, Emma's arms are not counted as points. Instead, only the stars' points are counted. Wait, but the problem says "how many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total?" So the two Stellas (each six-pointed) would contribute their points, and Emma's contribution would be zero if her arms aren't points. But that can't be right because the answer choices are all 15-18. Let me re-examine the problem. Wait, maybe the question is using "points" in a general sense for both stars and starfish. The original Stella is a six-pointed star. The starfish Emma, when she loses an arm, that arm becomes a six-pointed star. So perhaps the starfish's arms are considered as points in this context. For example, a starfish with five arms would have five points. But then, after losing one arm, Emma has four arms (points). Then the two Stellas each have six points. So total points would be 6 (original Stella) + 6 (Junior) + 4 (Emma's remaining arms) = 16. That's option B. But if the starfish's arms are not considered as points, then Emma contributes nothing, and the total would be 6 + 6 = 12, which is not an option. Therefore, the problem must be considering the starfish's arms as points. Alternatively, maybe the original question is a play on words. The starfish Emma is a star-shaped creature, so her arms could be analogous to points. So a normal starfish has five arms (points), but when she loses one, she has four. The two stars each have six points. So total points are 6 + 6 + 4 = 16. Therefore, answer B. Another angle: the problem says "Important: Emma does not regenerate the arm." So she loses one arm, so from five to four. The split-off arm becomes Stella Junior, which is a six-pointed star. So Stella Junior's points are six. Original Stella is six. Emma has four arms. So total points: 6 + 6 + 4 = 16. Answer B. That makes sense. The answer is B.
