But the problem mentions that one of Emma's arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star called Stella Junior. But after losing one, she has 4 arms left. Let's list them: - Original Stella: 6 points. - Stella Junior: 6 points. - Emma: 4 arms (since she lost one and doesn't regenerate). Adding those together: 6 + 6 + 4 = 16. Wait, but the options are A.15, B.16, C.17, D.18. So that would point to B.16. But let me check again to make sure I didn't miss anything. Original Stella is a six-pointed star, so 6. Emma was a common starfish, which typically has 5 arms. She loses one arm, so 5-1=4. Then the Stella Junior is a six-pointed star, so 6. Total is 6+4+6=16. Yes, that seems correct. I don't see any other factors mentioned. The problem says "the two Stellas and Emma." So the two Stellas are the original Stella (6 points) and Stella Junior (6 points), and Emma with 4 arms. So 16 total. The answer should be B.
