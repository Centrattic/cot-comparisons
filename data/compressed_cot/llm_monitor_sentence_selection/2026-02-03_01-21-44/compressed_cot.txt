So, there's a six-pointed star named Stella. One day, one of Stella's arms splits off and becomes another six-pointed star, called Stella Junior. Original Stella is a six-pointed star, so that's 6 points. So, Stella Junior is also a six-pointed star. Oh, okay, so here "its" refers to Emma's arm. But the problem says Emma does not regenerate the arm. So, Emma was a starfish, which is a sea creature. Starfish (sea stars) typically have multiple arms, usually five, but some have more. However, the problem doesn't specify how many arms Emma originally had. So this is a problem. How can we calculate the total points if we don't know Emma's original arm count? Wait, but maybe the problem is using "starfish" as a star, not the animal. Maybe there's a translation issue or terminology mix-up. Because in the problem, Emma is a "common starfish", which is a sea star, but then she splits off an arm. But the key is that the problem says "Important: Emma does not regenerate the arm." So, if Emma was a typical starfish (say, five arms), then she loses one arm, so she has four arms left. But then, the question is about how many points the two Stellas and Emma have in total. Wait, the problem says "the two Stellas and Emma". So Stella Senior (original six-pointed star) has 6 points. Stella Junior (the new six-pointed star) has 6 points. Emma, the starfish, after losing an arm. But how many arms did she have originally? This is the crux. If we can figure out Emma's original number of arms, subtract one, and add that to the two Stellas' points, we can get the total. But the problem doesn't state how many arms Emma originally had. However, perhaps we can infer from the fact that when the arm splits off, it becomes a six-pointed star. If Emma is a starfish, perhaps the number of arms she had before losing one is related to the six points. Maybe the problem assumes that a starfish (as a sea creature) normally has five arms. Then, she loses one, so she has four. Then total points would be 6 (Stella Senior) + 6 (Stella Junior) + 4 (Emma) = 16. Which is option B. Alternatively, if the problem is using "starfish" as a star, then maybe Emma was a star with a certain number of points. But the problem says "common starfish" which is a sea creature. But maybe the problem is using "starfish" in a different way. Alternatively, maybe the problem is mixing metaphors. For example, a starfish (sea star) is often depicted as a five-pointed star. So if Emma is a common starfish, she has five arms. Then she loses one, so four arms left. Then total points: 6 +6 +4=16. So answer B. But let me check again. The problem says Emma is a "common starfish". If common starfish typically have five arms, then yes. But if the problem is in a context where starfish are considered to have six arms, then after losing one, she has five. Then total would be 6+6+5=17 (C). But the problem states that the split-off arm becomes a six-pointed star. So perhaps the original arm was part of a six-pointed structure. But Emma is a common starfish. Maybe the problem is implying that Emma was originally a five-armed starfish, and when one arm splits off, she is left with four. The split-off arm becomes a six-pointed star, but that might not relate to her original arm count. So that would make total 6+6+4=16, which is B. Alternatively, if the problem is using "starfish" as a star, then maybe Emma was a star with, say, five points, but then loses one, making four. But that would be a stretch because a starfish is a sea creature. But given the problem's wording, I think the intended interpretation is that Emma is a sea star (starfish) with five arms. Losing one leaves her with four. So total points from the two Stellas (6+6=12) plus Emma's four arms: 16. Answer B.
