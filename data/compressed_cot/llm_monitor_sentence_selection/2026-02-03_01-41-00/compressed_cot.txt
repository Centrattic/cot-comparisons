Now, starfish usually have five arms, right? But importantly, Emma does not regenerate the arm. So when the arm splits off, she loses that arm. So Emma's total arms after that would be 5 - 1 = 4 arms. But the split arm becomes a new six-pointed star, which we'll call Stella Junior. So Stella Junior has 6 points like the original Stella. Now, the question is asking for the total number of points from the two Stellas and Emma. Let's break that down: Original Stella: 6 points
Stella Junior: 6 points
Emma after losing an arm: 4 arms (since she doesn't regenerate) Adding those together: 6 + 6 + 4 = 16. Looking at the options, B is 16. So the answer should be B.
