But she's grateful for the child. Original Stella is a six-pointed star. Then Stella Junior is also a six-pointed star, so another 6 points. That's 6 + 6 = 12 so far. So Emma originally had, say, 5 arms. Stella Junior: 6 points. Emma: originally a starfish. When one arm splits off, Emma loses that arm. So how many arms did Emma have before? Let's think. The problem says Emma is a "common starfish." A common starfish is typically a five-armed starfish. So if she starts with five arms, then loses one, she has four arms. But how are those arms counted as points? If the problem counts each arm as a point, then Emma has four points. So total is 6 + 6 + 4 = 16. Which is option B. But wait, maybe the problem is not considering Emma's arms as points. The question is about "points," which are specific to the stars. The starfish is a starfish, and maybe the points are only from the stars. But then Emma would contribute zero, but that can't be right because the answer would be 12, which isn't an option. The options start at 15. So that can't be. Therefore, the only way to reach one of the given options is to count Emma's remaining arms as points. Let's check: Original Stella: 6 points. Stella Junior: 6 points. Emma: originally 5 arms, loses 1, so 4 arms. So 4 points. Total 6+6+4=16. Which is option B. But maybe the common starfish has a different number of arms. Wait, maybe the problem is using "starfish" as a star shape. For example, a starfish (sea star) is typically 5-armed, but some species have more. But the problem says "common starfish," which is likely 5. So the original count is 5 arms. After losing one, 4. So adding 4 to 12 gives 16. Answer B. Alternatively, if the problem counts the original Stella's arm that split off as part of the total? No, because that arm has become Stella Junior. So the original Stella now has 5 points? Wait, the original Stella was a six-pointed star. If one arm splits off, does the original Stella lose a point? The problem says "one of its arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star." So the original Stella is the parent star. If an arm splits off, maybe the original Stella is now missing an arm. But the problem doesn't mention the original Stella losing a point. Wait, Stella is a star in the sky. If one of its arms splits off, does the original Stella lose that arm? Or does it remain as a six-pointed star? Wait, the problem says that Emma is a starfish (on the ocean floor) who watches the star Stella. Then one day, one of its (Stella's?) arms splits off. Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Which one's arm splits off? The original Stella is a six-pointed star in the sky. How can it have arms? Unless the star is depicted as a starfish-like shape. But stars are usually depicted with points, not arms. However, maybe in this story, the six-pointed star Stella is shaped like a starfish, with six arms. Then, Emma is a starfish (on the ocean floor) who loses one of her arms, which splits off and becomes a six-pointed star. Wait, the problem says "one of its arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star." The "its" here refers to Emma's arm. Because Emma is the one who is a starfish. So the arm splits off from Emma, and that arm becomes a six-pointed star. So the original Stella is separate. So the two Stellas are the original Stella (the six-pointed star in the sky) and Stella Junior (the new one that grew from Emma's arm). So original Stella is still 6 points. Stella Junior is 6 points. Emma, who was a common starfish, originally had 5 arms. She lost one arm, so she has 4 arms. So if we count each arm as a point, then Emma has 4 points. Total is 6 + 6 + 4 = 16. So the answer is B. Yes, that makes sense. So the answer is B.
