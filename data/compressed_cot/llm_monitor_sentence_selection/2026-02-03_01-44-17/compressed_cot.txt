The problem is about counting the total number of points from the two Stellas and Emma. Let me check the details again. Normally, starfish have arms, not points. So Emma's points would be based on her remaining arms? Stella Junior is also a six-pointed star. Emma is a starfish, which is a different shape. But perhaps the problem is considering the starfish's arms as points. However, the problem doesn't specify how many arms Emma originally had. Hmm. Wait, the problem says Emma is a "common starfish." A typical starfish, like the common starfish (Asterias), has five arms. So if she had five arms, then after losing one, she has four arms. If each arm is considered a "point," then Emma has four points. Then the two Stellas each have six points. So total would be 6 (original Stella) + 6 (Stella Junior) + 4 (Emma's remaining arms) = 16. So the answer would be B. 16. But let me check again. The problem says "how many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total?" So the two Stellas each have six points. Emma is a starfish. If the problem counts her arms as points, then she has four arms left (since one was lost and not regenerated). So 6 + 6 + 4 = 16. So answer B. But wait, is there a possibility that the starfish's original number of arms is different? For example, some starfish have more arms. But the problem says "common starfish," which is typically five-armed. So I think that's safe. Another angle: maybe the problem is a trick question. Because Emma is a starfish, which is not a star. So maybe the question is only counting the points of the stars (the two Stellas) and not Emma's arms as points. But that would be 6 + 6 = 12, which isn't an option. The options start at 15. So that can't be right. Therefore, the problem must be considering Emma's arms as points. So the key is to figure out how many arms Emma has after losing one. Assuming a common starfish has five arms, losing one leaves four. So 6 + 6 + 4 = 16. Answer B. But wait, the problem states that the child is called Stella Junior, which is a six-pointed star. So the arm that split off became a star with six points. But Emma's original arm count is the key here. If Emma is a common starfish, five arms. She loses one, so four. So total points: Stella Senior (6) + Stella Junior (6) + Emma's four arms = 16. So B. 16 is the answer.
