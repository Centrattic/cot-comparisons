Wait, starfish typically have five arms, right? Originally, a common starfish usually has five arms. But wait, the problem says that the arm splits off and becomes Stella Junior. So originally Emma had five arms. After losing one, she has four. Stella is a six-pointed star, so 6 points. Stella Junior is also a six-pointed star, so another 6. So total points would be 6 (Stella) + 6 (Junior) + 4 (Emma's arms) = 16. That would be 16, which is option B. Wait, but wait. The problem says "points" in the context of the stars and the starfish. A starfish's arms are not points, but maybe the question is using "points" metaphorically for the starfish as well. But the problem mentions that Emma is a common starfish. So normally, a starfish has five arms. So when they say "points", maybe for Emma, each arm is a point. So original Stella is 6 points, Stella Junior is 6 points. Emma, after losing an arm, has 4 arms left. So 6 + 6 +4 = 16. So answer B. But let me check again. The problem says "how many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total?" So the two Stellas each have 6 points, so 12. Emma, the starfish, originally had 5 arms, but lost one, so 4. So 12 +4=16. So the answer is B. 16. So the correct choice is B.
