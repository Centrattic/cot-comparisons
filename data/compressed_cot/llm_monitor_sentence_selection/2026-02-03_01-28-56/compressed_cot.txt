Hmm. Also, it's important to note that Emma does not regenerate the arm. But wait, starfish typically have five arms, right? Then Emma is a starfish. Wait, the problem might be using "points" as in the arms of the starfish. Because a starfish's arms could be considered as points if it's shaped like a star. But the original Stella is a six-pointed star, so that's clear. Emma is a common starfish. Let me think again. The problem says that Emma is a common starfish. If the common starfish (like the common starfish, Asterias rubens) typically has five arms. So Emma starts with five arms. Then one arm splits off, so she loses that arm. So she now has four arms. But the problem says that Emma is grateful for the child, Stella Junior. Stella Junior is a six-pointed star. So Stella Junior has six points. The original Stella is a six-pointed star, so that's six points. Emma, after losing an arm, has four arms. But are those arms considered points? The question is about the total points of the two Stellas and Emma. So the two Stellas each have 6 points, so 6 + 6 = 12. Then Emma's points—since she's a starfish, perhaps her arms are considered points. So if she has four arms left, that's four points. So total would be 12 + 4 = 16. Which is option B. Wait, but maybe the original Stella is a star with six points, and Stella Junior is a six-pointed star. But what about Emma? The problem says Emma is a starfish. So if a starfish's arms are considered points, then yes. But if the problem is using "points" strictly for stars, then Emma's arms wouldn't count. But that seems unlikely. Because the problem mentions that Emma is a starfish, and the question is about points. The problem must intend that the starfish's arms are considered points here. Otherwise, Emma would contribute zero points, and the total would be 6 + 6 = 12, which isn't an option. So the answer must be that Emma's arms are considered points. So original Stella: 6, Stella Junior: 6, Emma: 4. Total 16. So option B.
