Then there's Emma, a common starfish. The story says that one day, one of Emma's arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star, which she names Stella Junior. So when the arm splits off, Emma loses that arm and doesn't grow a new one. So if Emma originally had five arms, and one splits off, she now has four arms left. Now, Stella Junior is the new six-pointed star. So Stella Junior also has six points. So we have two Stellas: the original Stella with six points and Stella Junior with six points. Then Emma, the starfish, now has four arms. So adding them up: Stella (6) + Stella Junior (6) + Emma (4) = 16. Let me check again. Original Stella: 6. Emma starts with 5, loses one arm, so 4. Stella Junior is the split arm that becomes a six-pointed star. So yes, 6 + 6 + 4 = 16. The answer should be B.
