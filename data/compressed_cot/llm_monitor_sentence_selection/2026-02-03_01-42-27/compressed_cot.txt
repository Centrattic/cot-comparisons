Stella is a six-pointed star, so she has 6 points. The key point here is that one of her arms split off to create Stella Junior. So, normally, if a starfish loses an arm, they might regenerate it, but in this case, Emma doesn't. So total would be 6 + 6 + 4 = 16. But if the problem says that one of its arms split off, so Emma originally had five arms. After losing one, she has four. Since she doesn't regenerate, she remains with four. So, the total points would be Stella (6) + Stella Junior (6) + Emma (4) = 16. So the answer is B. Another possible angle: Maybe when the arm splits off, does the arm itself become a six-pointed star? So the split-off arm was one arm (so one point?), but then it grows into a six-pointed star. So Stella Junior is a separate entity. So Stella originally had six points. When one arm (point?) splits off, does that mean Stella loses a point? But the problem says that Emma is a starfish watching Stella, so perhaps Stella the star has six points, and when one arm splits off, it's not that Stella loses a point, but that the arm becomes a new star. Wait, maybe the problem is that Stella is a six-pointed star, so she has six points. The arm that splits off is part of the starfish Emma, not the star. Wait, maybe there's confusion between the star and the starfish. Let me re-read the problem. "A six-pointed star Stella shines bright in the night sky. A lonely common starfish Emma watches it in awe from the ocean floor, until one day, one of its arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star. Important: Emma does not regenerate the arm. Still, she is grateful for the child, whom she calls Stella Junior. How many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total?" So, the "its arms" refers to whose arms? The sentence says "one of its arms splits off". The subject before that is Emma, the starfish. So "its" refers to Emma's arms. So Emma's arm splits off and becomes Stella Junior. So Stella is the original six-pointed star. Then Stella Junior is the new six-pointed star. So Stella (original) has 6 points. Stella Junior is a six-pointed star, so 6 points. Emma, the starfish, originally had a certain number of arms. But one split off, and she didn't regenerate. So how many arms did Emma have initially? The problem says "common starfish". Common starfish typically have five arms. So originally, Emma had five arms. After losing one, she has four. So the total points are 6 (Stella) +6 (Stella Junior) +4 (Emma's remaining arms) = 16. So answer is B. Another possible confusion: Maybe the split-off arm is considered as part of the points. For example, when the arm splits off, does Emma lose an arm (so from 5 to 4), and the new star has 6 points. So yes, that's what we thought before. So total is 6 +6 +4=16. So answer B.
