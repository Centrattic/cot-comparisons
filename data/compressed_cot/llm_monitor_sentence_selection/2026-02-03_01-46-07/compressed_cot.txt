The original Stella is a six-pointed star, so she has 6 points. Normally, a starfish has 5 arms, but the problem mentions that one of her arms split off. So, initially, Emma had 5 arms (assuming a typical starfish), but one arm split off. The problem says: "How many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total?" The two Stellas are both six-pointed stars, so each has 6 points. So the answer would be B. So Emma's arm splits off. But Emma is a starfish. So Emma's arm splits off, and that arm becomes a six-pointed star (Stella Junior). However, Emma does not regenerate the arm. So Emma originally had X arms. Then one arm splits off, so she's left with X - 1 arms. The question is, what was X? If Emma is a common starfish, how many arms does she originally have? The term "common starfish" (Asterias rubens) typically has 5 to 9 arms, but usually around 5-7. However, in many contexts, a starfish is depicted with 5 arms. If we assume that Emma is a typical 5-armed starfish, then losing one arm would leave her with 4 arms. If each arm is considered a "point", then Emma contributes 4 points. The two Stellas contribute 6 each, total 12. 12 + 4 = 16, so answer B. Alternatively, maybe the problem is structured so that the original Stella had 6 points, and when one arm splits off, that arm becomes a new six-pointed star. Wait, if the arm splits off from Emma (the starfish), but the new star (Stella Junior) is a six-pointed star. So the original arm of the starfish (Emma) becomes a six-pointed star. So the number of points from that arm is 6. But Emma, after losing one arm, has (original number of arms -1). But the problem is that the question is about the total points from the two Stellas and Emma. So the two Stellas are each six-pointed stars. So 6 + 6 = 12. Then, Emma's points. If Emma was originally a starfish with N arms, and she lost one, then she has N-1 arms. But how many arms did she have originally? This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the problem again. The problem says "a common starfish". Common starfish usually have 5-7 arms. But perhaps in this problem's context, the common starfish is a 5-armed one. So if Emma is a 5-armed starfish, and she loses one arm, she now has 4 arms. So her points would be 4. Then total is 6 + 6 + 4 = 16 (B). Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the arm that split off from Emma is transformed into Stella Junior. So, the original arm of Emma is no longer part of Emma. But the problem states that Emma does not regenerate the arm, so she's missing one. Therefore, if the original Emma had 5 arms, now she has 4. Therefore, total points would be 6 (Stella) + 6 (Stella Junior) + 4 (Emma) = 16. So the answer is B. Another angle: perhaps the original Stella is a six-pointed star, which is different from a starfish. The starfish is a separate entity. The arm that splits off from Emma (the starfish) becomes a six-pointed star (Stella Junior). So the original Stella is still a six-pointed star. So Stella (original) has 6 points. Stella Junior is a six-pointed star (6 points). Emma, the starfish, after losing one arm, has N-1 arms. If the original number of arms for a common starfish is 5, then Emma now has 4 arms, so 4 points. Total is 16. Yes, that seems to make sense. So the answer would be B. 16.
