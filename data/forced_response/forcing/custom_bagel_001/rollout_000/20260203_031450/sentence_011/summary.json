How many holes total are in the two pieces I end up with? The options are A. 0, B. 1, C. 2, D. 4. First, I need to visualize a bagel. A typical bagel has a hole in the middle, right? So when it's whole, there's one hole. Now, the person is placing it flat on a table. Wait, does \"flat\" mean they're laying it on its side so that the hole is facing up and down? Or is it placed flat as in the usual position, like standing upright? Hmm. Maybe it's placed so that the circular hole is horizontal, like the bagel is lying on its side. But maybe the exact position isn't crucial here. The key part is slicing it vertically. A vertical cut would be from top to bottom. If the bagel is lying flat, a vertical slice would go through the center. Let me think. If you slice a bagel vertically through its center, you're dividing it into two halves. But what happens to the hole? The original hole is in the middle. When you cut it in half vertically, each half would have half of the original hole. But wait, the hole is a continuous ring. If you slice through the middle, each half would have a hole? Or does each half now have a new hole? Wait, maybe I should think about the topology here. A bagel is a torus. When you make a vertical cut through a torus, how does it split? If you cut a torus along a plane that passes through its central axis, you end up with two halves. Each half would still have a hole, right? Because the original hole is split into two separate holes? Or maybe each half has a hole that's connected? Wait, no. Let me think again. Imagine the bagel's hole is in the middle. If I make a vertical cut through the center, each half would have a hole that's half of the original. But since it's a ring, cutting it in half vertically would create two pieces each with a hole. Wait, but if you slice through the center, each half would have a hole that's a semicircle? No, because the hole is a full circle. If you slice through the center vertically, each piece would have a hole that's a full circle? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if you cut the bagel into two halves, the hole would be split. Let me try to imagine cutting a bagel vertically. If you take a knife and slice straight down through the middle, each half would have a hole that's connected to the other half. Wait, but when you separate them, each half would have a hole that's now open on the cut side. Wait, but the original hole is still there. Let me think with an example. Suppose I have a bagel with a hole in the middle. When I cut it in half vertically, each half would have the same hole as before? No, because the hole is in the middle of the whole bagel. If you cut it into two halves, each half would have half of the original hole. But since the original hole was a single circle, cutting it in half would create two separate pieces, each with a hole? Or would the hole be split into two parts?",
