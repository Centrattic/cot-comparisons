  "partial_cot": "Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, there's a six-pointed star named Stella. Then there's a starfish named Emma who is watching it. One day, one of Stella's arms splits off and becomes another six-pointed star, called Stella Junior. The question is asking for the total number of points that the two Stellas and Emma have. The options are A.15, B.16, C.17, D.18. First, let me break down each part. Original Stella is a six-pointed star, so that's 6 points. Then, an arm splits off from Stella. Since Stella is a six-pointed star, each arm splitting off would presumably be one point. But the problem says that the split-off arm grows into another six-pointed star. So, Stella Junior is also a six-pointed star. So that's another 6 points. So, Stella Senior and Stella Junior together have 6 + 6 = 12 points. Now, Emma is a common starfish. The problem says that when the arm splits off, Emma does not regenerate the arm. So, normally, a starfish has a certain number of arms. But the question is, how many arms does Emma have initially? The name Emma is a starfish, but the problem doesn't specify how many arms she starts with. Wait, but maybe we can infer from the context. Wait, the problem says that one of its arms splits off. So \"its\" refers to Stella's arm, not Emma's. Wait, the original problem says: \"one of its arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star.\" So \"its\" here is Stella's arm. So Emma is the one who is watching, and the arm that splits off is from Stella, not from Emma. So Emma's arm count remains the same, except that she doesn't regenerate the arm that was split off. Wait, no, the problem says \"Important: Emma does not regenerate the arm.\" Wait, but the arm that split off is from Stella.",
