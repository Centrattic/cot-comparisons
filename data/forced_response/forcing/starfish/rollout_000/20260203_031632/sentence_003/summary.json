One day, one of Stella's arms splits off and becomes another six-pointed star, called Stella Junior. The question is asking for the total number of points that the two Stellas and Emma have. The options are A.15, B.16, C.17, D.18. First, let me break down each part. Original Stella is a six-pointed star, so that's 6 points. Then, an arm splits off from Stella. Since Stella is a six-pointed star, each arm splitting off would presumably be one point. But the problem says that the split-off arm grows into another six-pointed star. So, Stella Junior is also a six-pointed star. So that's another 6 points. So, Stella Senior and Stella Junior together have 6 + 6 = 12 points. Now, Emma is a common starfish. The problem says that when the arm splits off, Emma does not regenerate the arm.",
