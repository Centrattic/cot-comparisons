One day, one of Stella's arms splits off and becomes another six-pointed star, called Stella Junior. The question is asking for the total number of points that the two Stellas and Emma have. The options are A.15, B.16, C.17, D.18.\n\nFirst, let me break down each part. Original Stella is a six-pointed star, so that's 6 points. Then, an arm splits off from Stella. Since Stella is a six-pointed star, each arm splitting off would presumably be one point. But the problem says that the split-off arm grows into another six-pointed star. So, Stella Junior is also a six-pointed star. So that's another 6 points. So, Stella Senior and Stella Junior together have 6 + 6 = 12 points.\n\nNow, Emma is a common starfish. The problem says that when the arm splits off, Emma does not regenerate the arm. So, normally, a starfish has a certain number of arms. But the question is, how many arms does Emma have initially? The name Emma is a starfish, but the problem doesn't specify how many arms she starts with. Wait, but maybe we can infer from the context.\n\nWait, the problem says that one of its arms splits off. So \"its\" refers to Stella's arm, not Emma's. Wait, the original problem says: \"one of its arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star.\" So \"its\" here is Stella's arm. So Emma is the one who is watching, and the arm that splits off is from Stella, not from Emma. So Emma's arm count remains the same, except that she doesn't regenerate the arm that was split off. Wait, no, the problem says \"Important: Emma does not regenerate the arm.\" Wait, but the arm that split off is from Stella. So maybe there's a confusion here.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The problem states: \"A lonely common starfish Emma watches it in awe from the ocean floor, until one day, one of its arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star. Important: Emma does not regenerate the arm.\"\n\nOh, okay, so here \"its\" refers to Emma's arm. Wait, but the original Stella is a star in the sky. How can Emma's arm split off? Wait, maybe there's confusion here. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nThe scenario is that Emma is a starfish (a common star, not a starfish) but the term \"starfish\" is used. Wait, the problem says \"a common starfish Emma watches it in awe\". So Emma is a starfish. Then, one day, one of its (Emma's?) arms splits off and becomes a six-pointed star. But the important note says Emma does not regenerate the arm. So, Emma originally had a certain number of arms. Then she loses one, and does not regenerate it.\n\nBut the problem says that the split-off arm becomes a six-pointed star, which is Stella Junior. So, Emma was a starfish. Let's assume that a common starfish typically has five arms, but the problem doesn't specify. Wait, but the problem might be using \"starfish\" as a star, not the sea creature. Wait, the initial sentence says \"A six-pointed star Stella shines bright in the night sky. A lonely common starfish Emma watches it in awe from the ocean floor...\" So Stella is a star (astronomical), Emma is a starfish (sea creature). Then, one day, one of its (Emma's?) arms splits off and becomes a six-pointed star. But the problem says Emma does not regenerate the arm. So, Emma was a starfish, which is a sea creature. Starfish (sea stars) typically have multiple arms, usually five, but some have more. However, the problem doesn't specify how many arms Emma originally had. So this is a problem. How can we calculate the total points if we don't know Emma's original arm count?\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is using \"starfish\" as a star, not the animal. Maybe there's a translation issue or terminology mix-up. Because in the problem, Emma is a \"common starfish\", which is a sea star, but then she splits off an arm. But the key is that the problem says \"Important: Emma does not regenerate the arm.\" So, if Emma was a typical starfish (say, five arms), then she loses one arm, so she has four arms left. But then, the question is about how many points the two Stellas and Emma have in total.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the two Stellas and Emma\". So Stella Senior (original six-pointed star) has 6 points. Stella Junior (the new six-pointed star) has 6 points. Emma, the starfish, after losing an arm. But how many arms did she have originally?\n\nThis is the crux. If we can figure out Emma's original number of arms, subtract one, and add that to the two Stellas' points, we can get the total.\n\nBut the problem doesn't state how many arms Emma originally had. However, perhaps we can infer from the fact that when the arm splits off, it becomes a six-pointed star. If Emma is a starfish, perhaps the number of arms she had before losing one is related to the six points. Maybe the problem assumes that a starfish (as a sea creature) normally has five arms. Then, she loses one, so she has four. Then total points would be 6 (Stella Senior) + 6 (Stella Junior) + 4 (Emma) = 16. Which is option B.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is using \"starfish\" as a star, then maybe Emma was a star with a certain number of points. But the problem says \"common starfish\" which is a sea creature. But maybe the problem is using \"starfish\" in a different way. Alternatively, maybe the problem is mixing metaphors. For example, a starfish (sea star) is often depicted as a five-pointed star. So if Emma is a common starfish, she has five arms. Then she loses one, so four arms left. Then total points: 6 +6 +4=16. So answer B.\n\nBut let me check again. The problem says Emma is a \"common starfish\". If common starfish typically have five arms, then yes. But if the problem is in a context where starfish are considered to have six arms, then after losing one, she has five. Then total would be 6+6+5=17 (C). But the problem states that the split-off arm becomes a six-pointed star. So perhaps the original arm was part of a six-pointed structure. But Emma is a common starfish. Maybe the problem is implying that Emma was originally a five-armed starfish, and when one arm splits off, she is left with four. The split-off arm becomes a six-pointed star, but that might not relate to her original arm count. So that would make total 6+6+4=16, which is B.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is using \"starfish\" as a star, then maybe Emma was a star with, say, five points, but then loses one, making four. But that would be a stretch because a starfish is a sea creature. But given the problem's wording, I think the intended interpretation is that Emma is a sea star (starfish) with five arms. Losing one leaves her with four. So total points from the two Stellas (6+6=12) plus Emma's four arms: 16. Answer B.\n",
