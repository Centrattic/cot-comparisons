  "thinking": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. The question is about counting the total number of points from the two Stellas and Emma. Let me start by breaking down the information given.\n\nFirst, there's a six-pointed star named Stella. So Stella has 6 points. Then there's a common starfish named Emma who is watching Stella from the ocean floor. The problem says that Emma is a \"common starfish,\" but it doesn't specify how many arms she has. Wait, starfish typically have five arms, right? But maybe that's not always the case. Let me think. The problem mentions that one day, one of Emma's arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star, Stella Junior. However, it's important to note that Emma does not regenerate the arm. So when the arm splits off, she loses that arm and doesn't grow a new one. \n\nSo initially, Emma must have had a certain number of arms. Let's assume that a common starfish has five arms, since that's typical. But the problem doesn't explicitly state how many arms Emma has. Wait, the problem says that when the arm splits off, Emma doesn't regenerate it. So if she loses one arm, her total number of arms would decrease by one. But we need to know how many she had before losing the arm. The problem says she's a \"common\" starfish. If we take \"common\" to mean the usual five-armed starfish, then she originally had five arms. After losing one, she would have four arms left. But the question is about the total points from the two Stellas and Emma. \n\nWait, the problem is asking for the total points from the two Stellas and Emma. Let me parse that again. The two Stellas are the original Stella (the six-pointed star) and Stella Junior, who is the arm that split off from Emma and became a six-pointed star. So Stella Junior is also a six-pointed star, right? Because it says \"grows into a six-pointed star.\" So Stella Junior would have 6 points as well. \n\nSo Stella (original) has 6 points. Stella Junior has 6 points. Then Emma, the starfish, after losing one arm. If she was originally a five-armed starfish, then she now has four arms. But the problem says \"the two Stellas and Emma have in total.\" So Emma's points are the number of arms she has left. Wait, but the problem is about \"points.\" So the original Stella is a six-pointed star, so 6 points. Stella Junior is also a six-pointed star, so another 6. Emma is a starfish. Starfish typically have arms, but do their arms count as points? The problem mentions that Emma is a \"common starfish,\" but when she loses an arm, she doesn't regenerate it. \n\nBut the problem is about the total points. The key here is to figure out how many \"points\" each entity contributes. The original Stella is a six-pointed star, so 6 points. Stella Junior is also a six-pointed star, so another 6. Emma is a starfish. Now, the problem is whether Emma's arms are considered points here. Since starfish have arms, but the problem uses the term \"points\" for the stars, maybe we need to assume that the starfish's arms are also counted as points in this context. \n\nSo the problem is in a fictional context where both stars and starfish have \"points,\" but the term is used differently. For the stars (Stella and Stella Junior), \"points\" are literal points of the star shape. For the starfish Emma, her arms are referred to as points. Wait, the problem says \"how many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total?\" So the two Stellas contribute 6 each (total 12), and Emma contributes the number of arms she has. \n\nThe key is to figure out how many arms Emma has after losing one. The problem states that Emma is a \"common starfish.\" The term \"common\" might be a hint. In reality, common starfish (like the common starfish, Asterias rubens) typically have five arms. However, some starfish can have more or fewer, but if the problem says \"common,\" we can assume five. \n\nSo initially, Emma had five arms. Then one arm splits off, making Stella Junior. Since she doesn't regenerate the arm, she now has 5 - 1 = 4 arms. Therefore, her contribution to the total points is 4. \n\nSo total points would be Stella (6) + Stella Junior (6) + Emma's arms (4) = 6 + 6 + 4 = 16. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is 16. \n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem says \"the two Stellas and Emma.\" So Emma is counted as is, with her remaining arms. But wait, Stella Junior is the arm that split off and became a six-pointed star. So Stella Junior is a star, so it contributes 6 points. So yes, that's correct. \n\nAnother angle: What if the original Emma had a different number of arms? For example, some starfish have more than five arms. But the problem says \"common starfish,\" which likely refers to five arms. Also, since the problem is a riddle, it's probably expecting the standard five-armed starfish. \n\nTherefore, the total points are 6 + 6 + 4 = 16, so answer B.\n",
