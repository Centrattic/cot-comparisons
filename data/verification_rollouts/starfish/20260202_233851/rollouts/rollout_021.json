  "thinking": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, there's a six-pointed star named Stella. Then there's a starfish named Emma who is lonely and watching Stella. One day, one of Stella's arms splits off and becomes another six-pointed star called Stella Junior. The important part here is that Emma doesn't regenerate the arm. We need to find the total number of points from the two Stellas and Emma.\n\nFirst, let's break down each entity. Stella is a six-pointed star, so she has 6 points. Then Stella Junior is also a six-pointed star, so that's another 6 points. Now, Emma is a starfish. Normally, a starfish has arms, but the question is how many arms does Emma have? The problem says that one of its arms splits off. But Emma doesn't regenerate the arm. Wait, so originally, how many arms did Emma have? Typically, a starfish has five arms, right? But maybe the problem is using \"starfish\" differently. Wait, but in the problem, Stella is a six-pointed star. Maybe the starfish Emma is a common starfish, which usually has five arms. But let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says that Emma is a \"common starfish\". Common starfish, like the ones we usually see in pictures, typically have five arms. But maybe in some contexts, they can have more? But the problem doesn't specify. But here's the thing: one of its arms splits off. So, if Emma originally had, say, five arms, and one splits off, then she loses that arm. But since she doesn't regenerate it, she would have four arms left. But then how does that affect the total points?\n\nWait, the question is about the total points of the two Stellas and Emma. So Stella (original) is 6 points, Stella Junior is 6 points. Then Emma's points would be based on her arms. But if she lost one arm and doesn't regenerate, how many arms does she have now?\n\nWait, the problem says Emma is a \"common starfish\". Let me think\u2014if a common starfish typically has five arms, then normally she would have five. But one arm splits off. So she loses one arm. So she would have 5 - 1 = 4 arms left. But the problem says Emma does not regenerate the arm. So she stays with four arms. So her \"points\" would be four? But wait, starfish arms are not points like a star's points. Wait, the problem mentions \"points\" for the stars, but for Emma, a starfish, does each arm count as a point? The problem says \"how many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total?\" So points for the stars (each six-pointed) and Emma's points. But how is Emma's points calculated? If Emma's arms are considered as points, then after losing one, she has four arms. So total would be 6 + 6 + 4 = 16. Which is option B.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again. The original Stella is a six-pointed star. So 6 points. Stella Junior is also a six-pointed star. So 6 points. Emma is a starfish. But the problem says \"how many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total?\" So the question is whether Emma's \"points\" are based on her arms. But starfish aren't typically described as having \"points\" like stars. However, since the problem is using \"points\" for the stars and mentions Emma as a starfish, perhaps in the context of the problem, starfish have arms that are considered as points. Or maybe the problem is using \"points\" in a different way. Wait, maybe the problem is using the term \"points\" for the stars, and for the starfish, it's about the number of arms. Because otherwise, Emma wouldn't contribute any points. But that doesn't make sense. The problem must be considering the starfish's arms as points. So if Emma originally had five arms (common starfish), lost one, so four arms left. So total points: 6 + 6 + 4 = 16. Answer B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original starfish had more arms. Wait, some starfish have more than five arms. But the problem says \"common starfish\". Common might mean the typical five-armed one. So the initial assumption is five arms. So after losing one, four. So 6 + 6 + 4 = 16. So B. Let me check again. The problem says that one of Emma's arms splits off and becomes Stella Junior. So the split-off arm becomes a star, but Emma loses that arm. So if she had five arms, now four. So total points from Emma is four. So total is 6 + 6 + 4 = 16. Answer B. That seems correct.\n",
