  "thinking": "\nOkay, let's see. So the problem is about counting the total number of points from the two Stellas and Emma. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the original Stella is a six-pointed star. So that's 6 points. Then there's Emma, the starfish. Wait, starfish usually have arms, but the question mentions points. But the problem says Emma is a common starfish. Common starfish typically have five arms, right? Like the typical starfish shape. But I should check if there's any detail here. The problem says that Emma loses one arm, which splits off and becomes Stella Junior. But Emma doesn't regenerate the arm. So originally, how many arms does Emma have? Let me think. The problem says that when one of Emma's arms splits off, she doesn't regenerate it. So after losing the arm, she has one less. But the question is about the total points of the two Stellas and Emma. So Emma's current state is after losing the arm. But what was her original number of arms?\n\nWait, the problem says \"a lonely common starfish Emma watches it in awe from the ocean floor, until one day, one of its arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star.\" The key here is that Emma is a common starfish. Common starfish, like the ones we usually see, typically have five arms. However, some species can have more, but the problem says \"common,\" so probably five. Let me confirm that. Yes, most common starfish (like the ones in pictures) have five arms. So initially, Emma has five arms. Then one arm splits off. But the problem says that Emma does not regenerate the arm. So after splitting off, Emma has 5 - 1 = 4 arms. But the question is about points. The original Stella is a six-pointed star, so 6 points. Stella Junior is also a six-pointed star, so another 6 points. Emma, after losing the arm, has 4 arms. But are arms considered points here? The problem mentions \"points\" for the stars, but for Emma, it's about arms. Wait, the question says \"how many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total?\" So the stars have points, but Emma is a starfish. The problem might be using \"points\" metaphorically for Emma's arms. Because starfish arms are like points. So maybe each arm counts as a point. So Emma, after losing one arm, has 4 arms (points). Let me check again.\n\nOriginal Stella: 6 points. Stella Junior: 6 points. Emma: originally 5 arms, loses 1, ends up with 4. So total points would be 6 + 6 + 4 = 16. Which would be option B. But wait, let me make sure there's no trick here. The problem says that Stella Junior is the child, which is a six-pointed star. So that's straightforward. Emma's original arms: 5. Loses one, so 4. So 6 (original Stella) + 6 (Junior) + 4 (Emma) = 16. So answer B. Let me check the options again. The choices are A.15, B.16, C.17, D.18. So yes, B is 16. But wait, could there be a different number for Emma's original arms? Suppose Emma is a starfish with more than five arms? For example, some starfish can have more arms, but the problem says \"common starfish,\" which typically have five. So I think five is correct. Therefore, the total is 16. Answer B.\n",
