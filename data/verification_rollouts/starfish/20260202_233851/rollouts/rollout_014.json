  "thinking": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The problem is about counting the total number of points from the two Stellas and Emma. Let me break down the information given.\n\nFirst, there's a six-pointed star named Stella. So Stella has 6 points. Then there's Emma, a starfish. Now, starfish are typically depicted with five arms, right? But the problem mentions that one of Emma's arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star, which is Stella Junior. But importantly, Emma does not regenerate the arm. That means after the arm splits off, Emma is left with one less arm. \n\nOriginally, Emma had, let's assume, the usual five arms. But wait, the problem says that when the arm splits off, Emma doesn't regenerate. So if she loses one arm, she would have four arms left. However, the problem doesn't explicitly state how many arms Emma had initially. Wait, maybe I should check that. The problem says \"a lonely common starfish Emma\". Common starfish usually have five arms, so I think we can assume she starts with five. \n\nSo initially, Emma has five arms. Then one arm splits off. Since she doesn't regenerate, she now has 5 - 1 = 4 arms. But wait, the question is about the total points from the two Stellas and Emma. So the two Stellas are the original Stella (the six-pointed star) and Stella Junior, which is also a six-pointed star. So each Stella has 6 points. So 6 + 6 = 12 points from the two Stellas. Then Emma, after losing an arm, has 4 arms. So adding that to the 12 gives 12 + 4 = 16. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Original Stella: 6 points. Stella Junior is a six-pointed star, so another 6. Emma originally had five arms, lost one, so four. Total points: 6 + 6 + 4 = 16. The answer should be B. 16. \n\nBut let me make sure there isn't any trick here. The problem says Emma is a starfish, but when an arm splits off and becomes a star, does that affect Emma's count? The problem says Emma does not regenerate the arm, so she's left with four arms. The Stella Junior is separate, so it's a new entity. So yes, 6 + 6 + 4 = 16. The answer is B.\n",
