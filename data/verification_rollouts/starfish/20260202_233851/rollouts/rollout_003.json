  "thinking": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, there's a story here about a six-pointed star named Stella, and a starfish named Emma. The question is about how many points the two Stellas and Emma have in total. The answer choices are A to D.\n\nFirst, let's break down the information given. The initial Stella is a six-pointed star. That's straightforward\u2014so Stella has 6 points. Then there's Emma, a common starfish. Now, starfish typically have a certain number of arms. The term \"common starfish\" might refer to the typical five-armed starfish, which is the most common type. So I'm assuming Emma starts with five arms.\n\nThe story says that one day, one of Emma's arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star, which she names Stella Junior. But importantly, Emma does not regenerate the arm. So when the arm splits off, Emma loses that arm and doesn't grow a new one. So if Emma originally had five arms, and one splits off, she now has four arms left. \n\nNow, Stella Junior is the new six-pointed star. So Stella Junior also has six points. So we have two Stellas: the original Stella with six points and Stella Junior with six points. Then Emma, the starfish, now has four arms. \n\nSo adding them up: Stella (6) + Stella Junior (6) + Emma (4) = 16. Let me check again. Original Stella: 6. Emma starts with 5, loses one arm, so 4. Stella Junior is the split arm that becomes a six-pointed star. So yes, 6 + 6 + 4 = 16. The answer should be B.\n",
