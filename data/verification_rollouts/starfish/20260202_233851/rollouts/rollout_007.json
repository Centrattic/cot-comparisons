  "thinking": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a six-pointed star named Stella. Then there's a starfish named Emma who's watching it. The key points here are about their points and what happens when one of Emma's arms splits off.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many points each of them has initially. A six-pointed star typically has six points, so Stella has 6. Emma is a starfish. Now, starfish usually have five arms, right? Unless specified otherwise, I should assume she's a common starfish with five arms. So Emma starts with 5 arms.\n\nThen, the story says that one day, one of Emma's arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star. But importantly, Emma does not regenerate the arm. So when the arm splits off, she loses that arm. So Emma's total arms after that would be 5 - 1 = 4 arms. But the split arm becomes a new six-pointed star, which we'll call Stella Junior. So Stella Junior has 6 points like the original Stella.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the total number of points from the two Stellas and Emma. Let's break that down:\n\nOriginal Stella: 6 points\nStella Junior: 6 points\nEmma after losing an arm: 4 arms (since she doesn't regenerate)\n\nAdding those together: 6 + 6 + 4 = 16. \n\nLooking at the options, B is 16. So the answer should be B.\n",
