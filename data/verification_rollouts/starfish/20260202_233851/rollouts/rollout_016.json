  "thinking": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, there's a six-pointed star named Stella. Then there's Emma, a starfish. Wait, starfish are usually called sea stars, right? And they have arms. The problem says Emma is a common starfish, so maybe she's a typical five-armed starfish? But the problem doesn't specify how many arms she has initially. Hmm.\n\nThe story says that one day, one of Emma's arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star. But importantly, Emma does not regenerate the arm. So, normally, if a starfish loses an arm, they might regenerate it, but in this case, she doesn't. So Emma ends up with one less arm. But she has a child star named Stella Junior.\n\nThe question is asking for the total number of points the two Stellas and Emma have in total. So, we need to count the points of the original Stella, Stella Junior, and Emma's remaining arms.\n\nFirst, let's break down each entity:\n\nOriginal Stella is a six-pointed star. So she has 6 points.\n\nStella Junior is also a six-pointed star, so that's another 6 points.\n\nNow, Emma. Initially, she was a common starfish. The term \"common starfish\" might refer to a typical species. Most common starfish, like the ones you see in pictures, usually have five arms. But maybe some have more. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe we can assume five arms? But wait, the problem says that one of her arms splits off. So initially, she had, say, five arms. Then one splits off, so she loses that arm and doesn't regenerate it. So she would have 5 - 1 = 4 arms left. But wait, if she's a common starfish, maybe she starts with more arms? For example, some starfish have more than five arms. But the term \"common starfish\" might refer to the common starfish (Asterias rubens), which typically has five or six arms. But since the problem says \"common\", maybe five is safer. But I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that the initial number of Emma's arms is five. Let me think. If Emma is a starfish, let's assume she starts with five arms. Then one splits off. So she loses that arm, and doesn't regenerate. So she now has four arms. So Emma contributes four points? Wait, starfish arms aren't points, but the problem refers to \"points\". Wait, the question says \"how many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total?\" So the two Stellas are stars with points, and Emma's arms are counted as points? Or maybe the problem is using \"points\" as a general term for arms or star points.\n\nSo, Stella and Stella Junior are stars with points. Emma is a starfish with arms, but each arm is considered a \"point\" here. So the total would be 6 (original Stella) + 6 (Junior) + Emma's remaining arms.\n\nSo if Emma originally had five arms, lost one, now has four. Then total is 6+6+4=16. Which would be option B.\n\nBut wait, what if Emma originally had six arms? Let's say the common starfish has six arms. Then losing one would leave her with five. Then total is 6+6+5=17, which is option C. But that depends on how many arms Emma had initially.\n\nThe problem says \"a lonely common starfish Emma\". The term \"common starfish\" might refer to a species. For example, the common starfish (Asterias forbesi) typically has five or six arms. But without specific knowledge, maybe the problem expects us to assume five arms as the common number. Also, in many stories or general knowledge, starfish are often depicted with five arms. So maybe start with five.\n\nBut then when one arm splits off, she loses that arm. So she has four left. So total points: 6 + 6 + 4 = 16. Which is option B.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"one of its arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star\". So the split-off arm becomes a star. But Emma is a starfish. So maybe the arm splitting off is part of the story. But the problem says Emma does not regenerate the arm. So she loses that arm permanently. So if she starts with five, ends with four. So 4 points from Emma. Adding the two stars with 6 each: 6+6+4=16. So answer B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Emma is a starfish with more arms. But since the problem says \"common starfish\", which is typically five-armed. So answer B.\n",
