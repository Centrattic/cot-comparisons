  "thinking": "\nOkay, let's break this down. So there's a six-pointed star named Stella. Then there's a starfish named Emma who is common and lonely. One day, one of Stella's arms splits off and becomes another six-pointed star called Stella Junior. The key point here is that Emma does not regenerate the arm she loses. The question is asking for the total number of points the two Stellas and Emma have in total.\n\nFirst, let's consider what each entity is. A six-pointed star, like Stella, has 6 points. So Stella is 6 points. Then Stella Junior, which is also a six-pointed star, so that's another 6 points. Now, Emma is a starfish. Normally, a starfish has multiple arms. But the problem says Emma is a common starfish. Wait, the problem mentions that Emma is a starfish, but it's important to note that she's a \"common\" one. But how many arms does a common starfish have? Typically, starfish (or sea stars) have five arms. But some species can have more or fewer, but the most common is five. So assuming a common starfish has five arms.\n\nBut here's the twist: Emma loses one arm, which splits off and becomes Stella Junior. However, Emma does not regenerate the arm. So initially, Emma had, say, five arms (as a common starfish). Then she loses one arm, making her have four arms. But wait, the problem states that Emma is a common starfish. If she's a common starfish, maybe she started with five arms. Let me check the problem again. The problem says \"a lonely common starfish Emma watches it in awe from the ocean floor, until one day, one of its arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star.\" Wait, \"its arms\" \u2013 does that mean Emma's arm splits off? So Emma is the one who loses an arm. But Emma is a starfish. So originally, Emma would have, say, five arms (common starfish). Then she loses one arm, which becomes Stella Junior. But Stella Junior is a six-pointed star. Wait, but how does an arm from a starfish become a six-pointed star? The problem states that \"one of its arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star.\" So the arm itself becomes a star. So the arm that split off is now a six-pointed star (Stella Junior). But Emma no longer has that arm. Since she doesn't regenerate it, her total arms are reduced by one. \n\nSo, let's get the numbers. Original Stella is a six-pointed star: 6 points. Stella Junior is a six-pointed star: another 6 points. Emma is a common starfish who lost one arm and doesn't regenerate it. Let's figure out how many arms she originally had. The problem says \"common starfish Emma\". Common starfish usually have five arms. So if she started with five arms and lost one, she has four arms left. Therefore, Emma contributes four arms (points? Wait, the problem is asking for the total number of points. Wait, the question is about points. So the six-pointed stars have points (Stella and Stella Junior each have 6 points). But Emma is a starfish. Do starfish arms count as points? The problem says \"how many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total?\" So the two Stellas are Stella and Stella Junior, each with 6 points. Then Emma, the starfish, has a number of arms, which are counted as points? Or is the term \"points\" only referring to the stars? The problem is a bit ambiguous here. Wait, the question is phrased as \"how many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total?\" So the two Stellas are the stars, each with 6 points, and Emma, a starfish, which has a number of arms. The question is whether the starfish's arms are considered \"points\" here. The problem uses the term \"points\" for the stars, but for the starfish, it's \"arms\". However, the question is asking for the total points of the two Stellas and Emma. So perhaps the starfish's arms are being counted as points in this context. \n\nTherefore, we need to count Stella's 6 points, Stella Junior's 6 points, and Emma's remaining arms (which are now 4, if she was a five-armed starfish and lost one). So total would be 6 + 6 + 4 = 16. Which is option B. But let me double-check. \n\nWait, the problem says \"Emma does not regenerate the arm.\" So originally, Emma was a common starfish. Let's confirm what a common starfish has. The most common starfish (like the common starfish, Asterias rubens) has five arms. So if Emma is a common starfish, she starts with five arms. Then she loses one, so she has four arms left. Therefore, her contribution is four arms. So total points: 6 (Stella) + 6 (Stella Junior) + 4 (Emma) = 16. So answer B. \n\nBut wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering \"points\" as the same as arms for the starfish. So the two Stellas have points (each 6), and Emma's arms are considered as points as well. Therefore, total points would be 6 + 6 + (Emma's current arms). So if Emma started with five, lost one, she has four arms. Thus total is 16. So answer B. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 16.\n",
