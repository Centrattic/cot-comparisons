  "thinking": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, there's a six-pointed star named Stella. Then there's a starfish named Emma who's watching it. One day, one of Stella's arms splits off and becomes another six-pointed star called Stella Junior. Emma doesn't regenerate her arm, but she's grateful. The question is asking how many points the two Stellas and Emma have in total.\n\nFirst, let's break down each character. Stella is a six-pointed star. So, she has 6 points. Then there's Stella Junior, which is also a six-pointed star. That's another 6 points. So together, the two Stellas have 6 + 6 = 12 points.\n\nNow, Emma is a starfish. The key here is that Emma is a common starfish, not a six-pointed star. The problem says that a six-pointed star splits off from her, but Emma herself is a starfish. Now, starfish typically have multiple arms. The original problem mentions that Emma is a common starfish. The problem also states that one of her arms split off to become Stella Junior. But importantly, Emma does not regenerate the arm. So, if a starfish normally has a certain number of arms, and one splits off, how many arms does she have left?\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't specify how many arms Emma originally had. Hmm. Wait, but maybe the question is about points. The problem says \"how many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total?\" So, points might refer to the points of the stars and the arms of the starfish?\n\nWait, but the two Stellas are stars, each with 6 points. Emma is a starfish. The question is whether the arms of the starfish count as points. The problem says \"points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total\". Since the Stellas are stars with points, and Emma is a starfish, which has arms. But the problem might be using \"points\" metaphorically for the starfish's arms. But that's unclear. However, the problem mentions \"points\" in the context of the stars (six-pointed stars) and the starfish's arms. So perhaps the starfish's arms are considered as points here?\n\nWait, but the problem says Emma is a \"common starfish\". A common starfish usually has five arms. So if Emma originally had five arms, then one splits off. The problem states that Emma does not regenerate the arm. So, after losing one arm, she has four arms left. If we consider each arm as a \"point\", then Emma would contribute four points. But the problem says \"points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total\". So adding up Stella's 6 points, Stella Junior's 6 points, and Emma's four arms (as points?), that would be 6 + 6 + 4 = 16. So the total is 16, which is option B.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is trickier. Let me check again. The problem says \"one of its arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star.\" So the arm that split off became Stella Junior. The original starfish Emma had an arm that split off. But the problem says Emma is a common starfish. Common starfish have five arms. So if she loses one arm, she has four. But the problem states that the split-off arm becomes a six-pointed star. So maybe the arm itself is a six-pointed star? Wait, but the problem says that the arm splits off and grows into a six-pointed star. So the arm was part of Emma, but then becomes a star. So the original starfish Emma had five arms, then one arm splits off, so she's left with four arms. The split-off arm becomes a six-pointed star, which is Stella Junior. So the two Stellas (the original Stella and Stella Junior) each have six points, and Emma now has four arms. So total points would be 6 (Stella) + 6 (Stella Junior) + 4 (Emma's arms) = 16. So the answer is B. 16.\n\nBut wait, maybe the problem is not considering the starfish's arms as points. Maybe \"points\" only refers to the stars. But the question says \"how many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total?\" So it's the points of the two Stellas and Emma. Since Emma is a starfish, maybe the question is using \"points\" for the stars and \"arms\" for the starfish. But the problem says \"points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total\". If \"points\" only refer to the stars, then Emma would contribute zero, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the starfish's arms are also counted as points. The problem is a bit ambiguous, but given that the original Stella is a six-pointed star, and the split-off arm becomes a six-pointed star, perhaps the arm itself had six points. But that seems odd. Wait, the problem says \"one of its arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star.\" So the arm was part of Emma, but then becomes a star. So the star has six points. So the original Stella is a six-pointed star (6 points), Stella Junior is a six-pointed star (6 points), and Emma is a starfish. The question is, how many points do they have in total. So Emma's arms are not points, but the stars' points are. However, the problem says Emma is a starfish. The problem is phrased as \"how many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total?\" So maybe the starfish's arms are not considered points, so Emma contributes nothing? But that would be 6 +6 +0=12, which isn't an option. So that's not possible. The options are 15,16,17,18. So the correct approach must be that Emma's arms are counted as points. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using \"points\" in the sense of the starfish's points. Wait, but starfish have arms, not points. Unless the problem is referring to the starfish's arms as points. So if Emma originally had five arms, lost one, now has four arms (points?), so total points would be 6 (Stella) +6 (Junior) +4 (Emma) =16. Which is option B. So the answer is B.\n",
