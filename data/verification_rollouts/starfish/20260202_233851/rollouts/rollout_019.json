  "thinking": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about counting the total number of points from the two Stellas and Emma. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's the original Stella, the six-pointed star. So Stella has 6 points. Then there's Emma, the starfish. Wait, starfish usually have arms, but the question mentions points. Hmm. The problem says Emma is a common starfish. I think starfish typically have five arms, right? Unless specified otherwise. But maybe in this story, Emma has a different number? Wait, the problem says it's a common starfish, so probably five arms. But the question is about points. Does a starfish's arm count as a point? Or is a starfish's structure different?\n\nWait, the original Stella is a six-pointed star, so that's clear. Emma is a starfish. Normally, a starfish (like a sea star) has five arms. But maybe in this problem, they're using \"points\" to refer to the arms. So Emma, being a common starfish, likely has five arms. Let me confirm: the problem says Emma does not regenerate the arm that splits off. So originally, Emma had, say, five arms. Then one arm splits off and becomes Stella Junior. So after losing one arm, Emma has four arms left. But Stella Junior grows into a six-pointed star. Wait, but Stella Junior is a six-pointed star, so that would be 6 points.\n\nSo let's tally up:\n\nOriginal Stella: 6 points.\n\nEmma: After losing one arm, she has four arms. But wait, the problem says Emma is a common starfish. Common starfish usually have five arms. But when one arm splits off, she doesn't regenerate. So originally she had five arms, lost one, so now has four. But the question is about points. So if the starfish's arms are considered points, then Emma now has four points.\n\nStella Junior is a six-pointed star, so six points.\n\nTotal points: Stella (6) + Emma (4) + Stella Junior (6) = 16. So 6+4+6=16. That would be option B.\n\nWait, but wait. The problem says \"the two Stellas and Emma\". Original Stella, Stella Junior, and Emma. So yes, adding those three. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nOriginal Stella: 6 points. Emma starts as a common starfish. Common starfish typically have five arms. So before losing an arm, she has five. But she loses one, making it four. But the problem says \"Important: Emma does not regenerate the arm.\" So she remains at four arms. The split-off arm becomes Stella Junior, which is a six-pointed star. So Stella Junior's points are six. So total points from the two Stellas and Emma would be 6 (original Stella) + 6 (Stella Junior) + 4 (Emma's remaining arms) = 16. So answer B.\n",
