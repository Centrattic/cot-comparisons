  "thinking": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the question is about counting the total number of points from the two Stellas and Emma. Let me break down the information given.\n\nFirst, there's a six-pointed star named Stella. That's straightforward\u2014Stella has 6 points. Then there's Emma, a common starfish. Now, starfish typically have multiple arms, but the problem mentions that Emma is a common starfish. The term \"common starfish\" might refer to the typical number of arms a starfish has. From what I remember, most starfish have five arms, but some species can have more. However, since the problem doesn't specify any unusual number, I think we should assume the standard five arms for Emma. \n\nBut wait, the problem also says that one of Emma's arms splits off and grows into a six-pointed star called Stella Junior. Importantly, it's mentioned that Emma does not regenerate the arm. So, Emma loses one arm, and that arm becomes Stella Junior. Let me confirm the numbers here.\n\nOriginally, Emma would have, say, five arms. Then one arm splits off. So after that, Emma would have five minus one, which is four arms left. But wait, wait\u2014if Emma is a common starfish, maybe the initial number of arms is different? Let me check the problem again. The problem says \"a lonely common starfish Emma watches it in awe from the ocean floor...\" So \"common starfish\"\u2014I think the key here is that a typical starfish has five arms. So Emma starts with five arms.\n\nNow, when one arm splits off, that arm becomes a six-pointed star (Stella Junior). Emma doesn't regenerate that arm, so she remains at four arms. So Emma's total arms after the split is four. Then, Stella is the original six-pointed star, so 6 points. Stella Junior is another six-pointed star, so another 6 points. Emma has four arms. So total points would be 6 (original Stella) + 6 (Stella Junior) + 4 (Emma's arms) = 16. \n\nWait, but wait a second. The question says \"the two Stellas and Emma\". So the original Stella is a six-pointed star, Stella Junior is another six-pointed star, and Emma is a starfish. So the two Stellas are each six points. Then Emma, after losing an arm, has four arms. So total points: 6 + 6 + 4 = 16. That would be option B. \n\nBut let me double-check. The problem states that Emma does not regenerate the arm. So she started with five arms, lost one, so four. The split arm becomes Stella Junior, which is six points. So original Stella is six points. Emma has four arms. So total is 6+6+4=16. That's B. So the answer should be B.\n",
