  "thinking": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about counting the total number of points from the two Stellas and Emma. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's the original six-pointed star, Stella. So Stella has 6 points. Then there's Emma, the starfish. Wait, starfish usually have arms, not points. But the question mentions points. Hmm. Wait, maybe the starfish here is considered to have points like a star? Or maybe the problem is using \"points\" differently. Let me check the details again.\n\nThe problem says Emma is a common starfish. Normally, starfish have arms, not points. But when one of her arms splits off and becomes Stella Junior, which is a six-pointed star. Also, it's important to note that Emma does not regenerate the arm. So, Emma loses one arm, and that arm becomes Stella Junior. But how does this affect their points?\n\nOriginal Stella: 6 points. Stella Junior is a six-pointed star, so that's another 6 points. Now, Emma was a starfish. Let me think: starfish typically have five arms, but sometimes more. The problem doesn't specify how many arms Emma originally had. Wait, but maybe the key is that Emma is a common starfish. Common starfish usually have five arms. But when she loses one arm, she has four arms left. However, the problem is about points. Wait, perhaps the starfish's arms are considered as points here? Or maybe there's a confusion between arms and points.\n\nWait, the problem says that Emma is a starfish, and when an arm splits off, it becomes a six-pointed star. The question asks for the total points of the two Stellas and Emma. So Emma's points would be based on her remaining arms? Or maybe the original problem refers to the starfish's \"points\" as arms. But the problem says Emma does not regenerate the arm, so she's missing one arm. Let's assume that a common starfish normally has five arms. So if she loses one, she has four arms left. But if the problem counts each arm as a \"point,\" then Emma would have four points. But that might not be the case. Wait, maybe the problem is using \"points\" as in the star's points. The original Stella is a six-pointed star, so that's 6 points. Stella Junior is also a six-pointed star. Emma is a starfish, which is a different shape. But perhaps the problem is considering the starfish's arms as points. However, the problem doesn't specify how many arms Emma originally had. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem says Emma is a \"common starfish.\" A typical starfish, like the common starfish (Asterias), has five arms. So if she had five arms, then after losing one, she has four arms. If each arm is considered a \"point,\" then Emma has four points. Then the two Stellas each have six points. So total would be 6 (original Stella) + 6 (Stella Junior) + 4 (Emma's remaining arms) = 16. So the answer would be B. 16.\n\nBut let me check again. The problem says \"how many points do the two Stellas and Emma have in total?\" So the two Stellas each have six points. Emma is a starfish. If the problem counts her arms as points, then she has four arms left (since one was lost and not regenerated). So 6 + 6 + 4 = 16. So answer B. But wait, is there a possibility that the starfish's original number of arms is different? For example, some starfish have more arms. But the problem says \"common starfish,\" which is typically five-armed. So I think that's safe.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the problem is a trick question. Because Emma is a starfish, which is not a star. So maybe the question is only counting the points of the stars (the two Stellas) and not Emma's arms as points. But that would be 6 + 6 = 12, which isn't an option. The options start at 15. So that can't be right. Therefore, the problem must be considering Emma's arms as points. So the key is to figure out how many arms Emma has after losing one.\n\nAssuming a common starfish has five arms, losing one leaves four. So 6 + 6 + 4 = 16. Answer B. But wait, the problem states that the child is called Stella Junior, which is a six-pointed star. So the arm that split off became a star with six points. But Emma's original arm count is the key here. If Emma is a common starfish, five arms. She loses one, so four. So total points: Stella Senior (6) + Stella Junior (6) + Emma's four arms = 16. So B. 16 is the answer.\n",
