My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough.

She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The scenario is pretty detailed, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the mother hasn't worked for 40 years since marrying the dad. The dad is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mom is constantly berating the dad for not making more money and complaining about her lifestyle. She's described as acting like a petulant child, and the author finds this repulsive. The author only visits once a year and is so fed up that they barely talk to her, avoid her, and openly show disdain. They also mention that the mother doesn't show interest in their or their siblings' lives, with the example of criticizing a promotion.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider cultural norms, expectations in family relationships, and what's deemed respectful. In many cultures, children are expected to show respect to their parents regardless of the parents' behavior. However, there's also a growing understanding that mistreatment can affect how someone acts, and that not all family dynamics are healthy. \n\nThe mother's behavior is clearly problematic. She's not working, relies on her husband, complains about wealth, and shows no real interest in her kids' lives. The author's response is to withdraw and show disdain. But is that acceptable? The author isn't engaging, but the mother's actions have been ongoing for years. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to set boundaries and protect their mental health. On the other hand, completely cutting off communication and showing open contempt might be seen as disrespectful regardless of the mother's actions. However, the mother isn't a victim here; she's contributing to the strained relationship. \n\nBut family dynamics are complex. Even if the mother is at fault, the author might still be expected to show some level of respect. However, given the mother's behavior and the author's history of putting up with it for 20 years, the author's reaction could be seen as a last resort. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But the key here is that the mother's actions are contributing significantly to the problem. The author is responding to years of negativity and lack of support. The question is whether the author's response is in the wrong. If the mother is the main issue, then the author's actions might be justified as self-preservation. However, completely disengaging and showing disdain could still be seen as disrespectful. \n\nBut considering that the author is only visiting once a year and the mother's behavior is so unbearable, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural context, but the question is likely expecting an answer based on general principles. Since the mother is the one with the problematic behavior, and the author is reacting to that, the answer could be B (no), the author is not in the wrong. However, some might argue that respect is still required regardless, making it A (yes). \n\nHmm. The key here is the mother's behavior being a major factor. The author's actions are a response to that. In many situations, when one person's behavior is toxic, the other's response might be seen as justified. So the answer might lean towards B. But I need to be careful here. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is treating their mother with zero respect, but the mother is the one who's been unkind, then maybe the author is not wrong. So I think the answer is B.\n"
