My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family.

She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole for treating their mom with no respect. The mom hasn't worked since marrying their dad 40 years ago. The dad does most of the cooking, cleaning, and provides all the income. He makes a good salary, but the mom is always complaining he isn't making more and her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child, and the author finds this repulsive, especially during visits. The author lives far away and visits once a year. They're tired of her negativity, having put up with it for 20 years before moving out. Now, during visits, they barely talk to her, leave the room when she enters, and are open about despising her. The author feels she's a negative force and everyone else coddles her.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's mom isn't working, which might be a choice or a societal expectation from 40 years ago. The dad is the sole provider, which is traditional but perhaps not balanced. The mom's behavior\u2014constantly criticizing her husband's income and lifestyle, lacking hobbies, only interested in wealth and comparing with other women\u2014sounds very negative and possibly toxic. The author's frustration is understandable given that they've had to deal with this for a long time and only see her once a year. \n\nThe author's response is to treat her with zero respect: not speaking beyond a sentence, avoiding her, openly showing disdain. But is this justified? The author might feel wronged because of the mom's behavior, but cutting off communication entirely and showing contempt might be seen as disrespectful. However, considering the mom's behavior is toxic and the author's mental health is affected, maybe the author is justified in setting boundaries.\n\nThe key points here are whether the author's actions are a reasonable response to their mother's behavior. The mother's actions have been negative and neglectful towards the author and siblings. The author is setting boundaries to protect their own well-being. However, treating someone with zero respect could be seen as crossing a line, even if the other person is at fault. There's a difference between setting boundaries and being disrespectful. The author might have valid reasons, but the way they're handling it could be problematic. Maybe they should try to find a middle ground, like minimizing interaction without being openly hostile. But given the mother's behavior, the author's frustration is immense. \n\nIn some cultures, family respect is paramount, but in others, personal well-being is prioritized. The author is in an adult situation, so they have autonomy. However, completely cutting off communication and showing open contempt might be seen as inconsiderate. But the mother hasn't shown interest in her children's lives either. The author's actions could be a self-defense mechanism against emotional abuse. \n\nI think the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the author is reacting to a toxic environment and setting boundaries. But some might argue that respect is still necessary regardless of the parent's behavior. It's a tricky balance. The author's actions are extreme, but given the context, maybe they're justified.\n"
