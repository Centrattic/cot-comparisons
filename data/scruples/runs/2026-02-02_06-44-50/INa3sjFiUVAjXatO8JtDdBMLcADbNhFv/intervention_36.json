My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the given Reddit-style post is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author describes their mother as someone who hasn't worked in 40 years, relying on the father's income. The mom is portrayed as critical of the father's earnings, complaining about not having a lavish life, and being uninterested in the author's and siblings' lives. The author feels resentful and disrespectful towards their mother, avoiding interaction and even leaving the room when she's present. They express a deep dislike and have stopped engaging with her, which is causing tension during their annual visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social norms around treating family members. Respect is generally expected, even if someone is difficult. The author's behavior\u2014ignoring their mother, showing clear disdain, and avoiding interaction\u2014could be seen as disrespectful. However, the mother's behavior is also problematic; she's been neglectful and critical, which might explain the author's feelings.\n\nBut the key question is whether the author is in the wrong. While the mother's actions are clearly hurtful, the author's response of complete disengagement and showing hatred might be excessive. It's important to recognize that even in bad circumstances, maintaining some level of respect and civility is usually expected. The author might benefit from addressing the issues through communication or setting boundaries rather than outright disrespect. However, given the years of neglect and the mother's behavior, the author's resentment is understandable. \n\nBut the question is about whether they are in the wrong. From a societal perspective, treating a parent with zero respect, regardless of the parent's faults, is typically frowned upon. The author could be seen as in the wrong for not making an effort to maintain a respectful relationship, even if it's strained. On the other hand, the mother's actions are the root cause of the problem. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes), because the author is choosing to respond with complete disrespect, which is not acceptable regardless of the mother's behavior. However, there's a nuanced aspect where the mother's behavior is indeed toxic. But the question is about the author's wrong, not the mother's. So while the mother's actions are bad, the author's response is also harmful and disrespectful, making them in the wrong.\n"
