My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation involves a mother who hasn't worked in 40 years, relies on her husband's income, and is described as constantly complaining and negative. The author feels resentment and has started treating their mother poorly during visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social norms around family relationships. Generally, respect for parents is considered important, especially in many cultures. However, the situation here seems complex. The mother's behavior is portrayed as negative and dismissive towards her children and her husband. The author's response is to withdraw and show disdain, which is harmful.\n\nOn one hand, the mother's actions\u2014complaining, lack of support, and negative attitude\u2014could justify the author's feelings. People can feel justified in protecting their mental health by setting boundaries. But on the other hand, completely cutting off communication and showing disrespect might be seen as going too far, regardless of the mother's flaws. Family dynamics can be tricky, and while the mother's behavior is problematic, the author's approach could potentially harm relationships further.\n\nLegally, there's no wrong here; it's a personal and moral question. Ethically, the author might feel they're defending their well-being, but socially, there's an expectation to at least maintain some level of respect and decorum. The key is whether the author's actions are proportionate. The mother's behavior is toxic, but the author's response could be seen as equally toxic. The answer might depend on cultural values too. In some cultures, disrespectful treatment of parents is considered a serious issue regardless of the parent's conduct.\n\nI should also think about the concept of emotional neglect. The mother's lack of interest in her children's lives is a form of neglect, which is a valid reason for the author's resentment. However, responding with disdain and avoidance might not address the issue constructively. It's possible the author could seek a middle ground, like setting boundaries without complete disrespect.\n\nIn conclusion, while the mother's behavior is clearly toxic, the author's choice to treat her with zero respect might be seen as wrong because it undermines family bonds and could lead to further conflict. The author might benefit from finding a healthier way to manage their emotions without resorting to disrespect. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong), but with understanding of their difficult situation.\n"
