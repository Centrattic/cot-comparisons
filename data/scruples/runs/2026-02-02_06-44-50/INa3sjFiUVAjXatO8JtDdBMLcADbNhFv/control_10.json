My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation is that the mother has been housebound for 40 years, the father is the sole provider, and the mother is critical and complains a lot. The author is frustrated, visits once a year, and now avoids interaction, showing clear disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In many cultures, respecting parents is a key value. The author's actions\u2014leaving the room, barely speaking, expressing hatred\u2014are definitely disrespectful. But there's also the aspect of the mother's behavior. She's not working, has no hobbies, is critical, and neglects her children's lives. The author's resentment is understandable given the long-term negative environment.\n\nHowever, regardless of the mother's behavior, the author's response of complete disengagement and open disdain might be seen as crossing a line. Even if someone is a difficult parent, cutting them off entirely or treating them disrespectfully can have emotional consequences and may not align with societal expectations of familial duty. The question is whether the author's actions are justified by the mother's behavior. While the mother's actions are problematic, the author's treatment of her could still be considered wrong because maintaining some level of respect and politeness is generally expected, even in difficult family dynamics. The author's frustration is valid, but the approach taken might be seen as excessive and disrespectful.\n"
