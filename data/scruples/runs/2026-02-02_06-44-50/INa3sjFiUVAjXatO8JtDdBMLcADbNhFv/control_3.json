My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with no respect. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author's mom hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying their dad. The dad is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mom is criticized for not making more money and complains about not having a lavish lifestyle. She's described as a petulant child, uninterested in the author's life, and focuses on wealth. The author is now treating her with disdain, avoiding interaction, and showing open dislike during visits.\n\nFirst, the question is about whether the author is wrong. In many cultures, respecting one's parents is a value, but there are nuances. The mom's behavior seems to be problematic\u2014she's not contributing, is critical, and lacks empathy. The author feels mistreated and neglected for years. They're now an adult, living separately, and trying to set boundaries. \n\nBut in terms of right and wrong, the author's actions could be seen as disrespectful. Even if the mom's behavior is awful, the author is an adult and might need to find a way to communicate without being openly disdainful. However, the author might feel justified given the long-term mistreatment. Some would argue that they have the right to protect their mental health and set boundaries. Others might say that even in bad situations, you shouldn't treat a parent that way. \n\nI need to consider cultural context. In some places, disrespecting parents is seen as a serious issue regardless of their behavior. But in others, especially where individual well-being is prioritized, the author's actions might be more understood. Also, the author is an adult, so their responsibility might be different than if they were still living at home. \n\nThe key points here are the mom's behavior versus the author's response. The author is reacting to years of neglect and criticism. But the way they're handling it\u2014open disdain and cutting off communication\u2014could be seen as extreme. Perhaps a middle ground where they set boundaries without being disrespectful would be better. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn conclusion, while the mom's actions are clearly problematic, the author's treatment of her is disrespectful. Whether it's \"wrong\" depends on cultural and personal values. However, in most contexts, treating a parent with zero respect is considered wrong, even if the parent is flawed. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but there's a lot of nuance here.\n"
