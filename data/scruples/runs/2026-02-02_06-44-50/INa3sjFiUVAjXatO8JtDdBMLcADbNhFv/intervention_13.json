My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the question is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation describes a mother who hasn't worked in 40 years, relies on her husband for income, complains about money, and isn't supportive of her children. The author feels frustrated and disrespectful, so they avoid interacting with their mom, show disdain, and leave the room when she enters. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants to know what I think.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior is definitely problematic\u2014being a financial burden, constant complaints, lack of support. But the author's response is extreme. Disrespecting a family member, especially a parent, can have emotional consequences. However, the mother's behavior has been this way for years, leading to the author's resentment. \n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation to show respect to parents regardless of their behavior. But that doesn't mean the author is wrong for feeling this way. The question is whether the author is \"in the wrong.\" The mother's actions are contributing to the author's feelings. However, the author's response is not constructive. Ignoring and showing disdain might hurt the mother and could be seen as disrespectful regardless of the mother's faults.\n\nBut then, the author is also a victim of long-term emotional neglect and negativity. It's possible they're reacting to years of mistreatment. However, the way they handle it is still harmful. Maybe there's a middle ground where they can set boundaries without being disrespectful. But the question is about being in the wrong. The mother is clearly a difficult person, but the author's actions are still a choice. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they're choosing to treat their mother with disrespect, even if the mother's behavior is poor. But it's a complex situation with valid points on both sides. The answer depends on whether disrespect is justified given the mother's behavior. However, in most ethical frameworks, even if someone is a bad parent, the child isn't justified in being disrespectful. So the answer might be A. But I'm not entirely sure if there's nuance I'm missing.\n"
