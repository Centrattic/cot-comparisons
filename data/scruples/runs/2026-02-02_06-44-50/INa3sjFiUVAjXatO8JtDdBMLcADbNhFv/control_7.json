My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The user provided a scenario where the author is treating their mother with zero respect. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's mom hasn't worked for 40 years, relies on the dad for income, is critical of him, and doesn't show interest in her kids' lives. The author feels resentful and disrespectful, leading to them avoiding interaction and showing disdain during visits. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, it's understandable that they're frustrated. The mom's behavior sounds toxic\u2014constantly criticizing her husband and not supporting her children. The author might feel justified in their resentment because of the long-term negative treatment from their mother.\n\nBut from the other side, respect in family relationships is generally expected regardless of the other person's behavior. The author is cutting off communication, which could be seen as disrespectful. Even if the mom isn't perfect, treating someone with zero respect and showing aversion might not be the healthiest or most constructive approach. There's also the aspect of setting a good example, especially if they have siblings or if they're in a position to influence future interactions.\n\nHowever, the mom's behavior is definitely problematic. She's not contributing to the household, is critical, and neglects her children's lives. The author's feelings of resentment are valid given those circumstances. But the way they're handling it\u2014by completely avoiding interaction and showing disdain\u2014might not be the right approach. Maybe there's a middle ground where the author can set boundaries without being disrespectful, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not about the best solution.\n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation to respect parents regardless of their actions, though that can be a point of debate. If we go strictly by that, the author might be in the wrong. However, if we consider the mom's behavior as abusive or neglectful, then the author's reaction could be a form of self-preservation. \n\nI need to balance these perspectives. The author's feelings are valid, but their actions (treating mom with no respect) are problematic. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the severity of the mom's actions. Since the question is about being in the wrong, and typically in such questions, the expectation is to respect family members despite issues. But the mom's behavior is quite extreme. However, the author's response is also extreme. \n\nSo maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even if the mom's actions are terrible, the author's decision to treat her with zero respect is not acceptable. However, some might argue it's justified. But in most cases, the expectation is to handle such situations with some level of respect, even if it's difficult. So leaning towards A.\n"
