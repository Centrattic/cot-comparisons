My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with no respect. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author's mom hasn't worked since marrying their dad 40 years ago. The dad is the sole provider, does most of the cooking and cleaning. The mom complains about his income and isn't lavish enough. She's described as acting like a petulant child. The author lives far away, visits once a year, but during those visits, they avoid interacting, leave the room when she enters, and openly show dislike. The author is 20 years old now, so maybe they're an adult. They're frustrated because their mom doesn't support them and is negative.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the mom's behavior. She's not working, relying on her husband, complains about money, has no hobbies, and is disinterested in the kids' lives. That sounds pretty toxic. The author's reaction is to avoid her and show disdain. But is that wrong? \n\nOn one hand, respect for family is important, even difficult ones. However, the mom's behavior is clearly harmful and disrespectful. The author is an adult now, so maybe they have the right to set boundaries. But the question is about being in the wrong. Treating someone with zero respect, even if they're a bad parent, might not be justified. The author could have chosen to be respectful but still set boundaries without being openly disdainful. \n\nBut considering the mom's behavior, the author's frustration is understandable. They might feel justified in their actions. However, the way they handle it\u2014openly showing contempt and avoiding contact\u2014could be seen as disrespectful regardless of the mom's behavior. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we consider that respect is generally expected in family relationships, even when there's conflict, the author's actions might be seen as inappropriate. But if the mom's behavior is that toxic and the author is an adult setting boundaries, maybe they're not in the wrong. It's a tough call. The key points are the mom's constant negativity and lack of support versus the author's disrespectful treatment. The answer might depend on cultural expectations, but generally, even with a bad parent, treating them with no respect could be seen as the wrong approach. So maybe answer A, the author is in the wrong. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the mom's behavior is so bad that the author's resentment is justified, the answer might be B. Hmm.\n"
