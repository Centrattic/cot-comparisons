My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author treating their mother with zero respect. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years, the dad does most of the household work and provides all the income. The mom is described as complaining about the dad's income, having no hobbies, and showing no interest in the author's or siblings' lives. The author is now cutting her off during visits, leaving the room when she enters, and being openly disrespectful.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The author justifies their behavior by citing the mother's behavior. They mention that the mother is critical, negative, and uninterested in their lives. The author has been putting up with this for 20 years and is now avoiding interaction.\n\nOn one hand, the author is being disrespectful, which is generally frowned upon regardless of the reasons. Disrespect towards parents is often considered wrong in many cultures. However, the mother's behavior is also problematic\u2014being demanding, unappreciative, and emotionally distant. The author's actions might be a form of self-preservation or setting boundaries.\n\nIn some cases, people have difficult family situations and may need to set boundaries to protect their mental health. The question is whether the author's response is proportionate. While the mother's actions are hurtful, the author's approach of completely disengaging and showing disdain could be seen as going too far. However, in certain contexts, especially if the person has a history of abuse or neglect, such boundaries might be necessary.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong. From a traditional standpoint, showing disrespect to a parent is often considered the wrong. But considering the mother's behavior, some might argue the author is justified. However, the AITA subreddit often sides with the person needing to change their behavior, even if the other side is at fault. The community might emphasize that while the mother is problematic, the author still has a responsibility to treat her with basic respect.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the author is actively being disrespectful, even if the mother's behavior is poor. The author could try to find a middle ground, like setting boundaries without showing contempt. However, there's a counterargument that the author is not in the wrong if the mother's behavior justifies it. But typically, in these scenarios, the expectation is to maintain respect, hence the answer leans towards A.\n"
