My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation described is complex. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years, relies on the father for income, is critical of him, and hasn't shown interest in the author's life. The author is reacting by showing disrespect, avoiding interaction, and expressing disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior seems problematic\u2014lack of employment, constant criticism, and negativity. The author has had to endure this for 20 years and now only visits once a year. Their response is to cut off communication during visits. But is that justified?\n\nThe question is about whether the author is at fault. While the mother's actions are definitely harmful, the author's response is extreme. Disrespecting a parent and showing open hatred might not be the right approach, even if the parent's behavior is terrible. There's a difference between setting boundaries and completely cutting someone off with hostility. The author might be justified in feeling upset, but their actions could be seen as wrong because they're choosing to treat their mother disrespectfully and without compassion.\n\nHowever, the mother's behavior is also a significant factor. She's contributing to the toxic environment. The author's actions might be a reaction to years of neglect and negativity. But even so, treating someone with zero respect is not typically considered the right approach. There's a possibility that the author could be seeking a healthier way to handle the situation, like setting boundaries without hostility or seeking family counseling. \n\nSo, while the mother is clearly at fault in creating the toxic environment, the author's response of complete avoidance and disrespect might still make them partially at fault. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. In many cultural contexts, respecting one's parents is a value, so even if the parent is flawed, the child's total disdain could be seen as wrong. However, if the parent's behavior is truly toxic, the author might be justified in protecting their own mental health. \n\nBut the author's approach is extreme. Instead of showing respect, they show open hatred. That's where the issue lies. So maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because despite the mother's faults, the author's response is not healthy and contributes to the problem. The author should address their feelings without dehumanizing their mother.\n"
