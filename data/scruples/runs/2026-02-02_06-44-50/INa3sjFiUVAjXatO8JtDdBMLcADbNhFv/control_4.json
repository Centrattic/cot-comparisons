My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves the author treating their mother with zero respect. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's mom hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying the dad. The dad handles most household duties and provides the income. The mom is critical of him for not earning more and complains about their lifestyle. The author finds this repulsive and has a strained relationship with their mom. They only visit once a year and now avoid interacting, showing disdain. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nHmm. From the author's perspective, the mom is a source of negativity, not supportive, and has no hobbies or interests beyond wealth. The author's treatment is a reaction to years of this behavior. But from the mom's side, maybe she's neglected or in an unhappy marriage? The author's response is to completely cut off interaction, which could be seen as disrespectful regardless of the mom's actions. Even if the mom is difficult, treating her with zero respect might not be justified. The author might need to address the issues differently, like setting boundaries or having honest communication instead of total disengagement. Also, considering cultural expectations around family respect, but the user might be from a culture where that's emphasized. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong because respect should be maintained despite disagreements. But I should also consider if there's a valid reason for the author's behavior. However, the author's approach is extreme. They should handle it better, but maybe the mom's behavior is problematic. The question is about being in the wrong, not just about what's best. The author's actions are disrespectful, so they are in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
