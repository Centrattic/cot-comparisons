My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author treating their mother with zero respect. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the mother hasn't worked since starting the relationship with the father 40 years ago. The father is the sole provider, handling most of the cooking and cleaning. The mother is critical of the father's income and complains about her lifestyle not being lavish enough. She also has no hobbies and focuses on talking about wealth with friends. The author and siblings feel neglected, with the mother only offering criticism, like about the author's promotion taking too long. The author, after 20 years at home, now responds with minimal interaction during visits, avoiding her and showing disdain.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother this way. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the mother's behavior is clearly problematic. She's uninvolved with her children's lives, critical, and creates a negative environment. The father is the sole worker and householder, which might mean the mother isn't contributing, leading to her resentment or dissatisfaction. The author's treatment of the mother is disrespectful, but given the mother's behavior, maybe the author feels justified.\n\nHowever, treating someone with zero respect is generally frowned upon, regardless of the circumstances. Even if the mother is difficult, the author's approach of avoiding interaction and expressing hatred could be seen as crossing a line. Family dynamics can be complex, and while the mother's actions are hurtful, the author's response might not be the healthiest way to handle it. There's a difference between setting boundaries and outright disrespect. The author could be seeking better ways to manage their interactions without being disrespectful, but in this case, they've chosen to completely disengage, which could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the mother isn't a supportive figure.\n\nI need to weigh whether the author's actions are a reasonable response or if they're wrong for not showing respect. Respect is usually expected regardless of the other person's behavior. So even if the mother is terrible, the author's lack of respect might make them the asshole. However, if the mother's behavior is so toxic that the author can't engage without harm, maybe it's justified. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about whether the mother is worse.\n\nIn typical AITA scenarios, while the other person might have flaws, the one asking is often advised to handle things differently. So the author's approach of complete disengagement and disdain is likely the issue here. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're treating their mother disrespectfully, even if there are valid reasons. The right approach would be to set boundaries without total disrespect.\n"
