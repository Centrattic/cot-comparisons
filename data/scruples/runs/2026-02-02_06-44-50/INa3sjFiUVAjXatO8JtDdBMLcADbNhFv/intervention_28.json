My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves the author treating their mother with zero respect. The mother has been uninvolved, complaining, and not supportive. The author has a bad relationship with her, barely talks to her, and avoids her when visiting. The question is whether the author's behavior is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years, relies on the father's income, and is described as negative and uninterested in her children's lives. The author is clearly hurt and frustrated. But how does that affect their actions?\n\nThe author admits to treating their mother with zero respect\u2014avoiding her, not talking, showing disdain. Even if the mother is difficult, is it acceptable for the author to respond in such a way? Family dynamics are complex. While the mother's behavior is problematic, does the author have any responsibility to maintain a respectful relationship, even if it's difficult? \n\nIn many cultures and ethical frameworks, respecting family members is considered important, regardless of their behavior. However, there's also the aspect of self-care and protecting one's mental health. The author is within their rights to set boundaries to protect their well-being. But does setting boundaries cross into disrespect? The author's actions seem extreme\u2014leaving the room, showing disdain, not even speaking. That's more than just setting boundaries; it's actively showing contempt, which can be seen as wrong regardless of the mother's behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's behavior is also harmful. She's contributing to a toxic environment. The author's frustration is understandable. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Even if the mother is at fault, the author's disrespectful treatment might still be considered wrong. However, some might argue that in cases of chronic emotional neglect and toxicity, the child's response is a form of self-defense.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious. I need to weigh whether the author's actions, while understandable, cross into unacceptable behavior. The key is whether respect is due regardless of the other person's actions. In many ethical perspectives, respect is a two-way street, but one can still choose to be respectful to maintain dignity, even in difficult relationships.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we consider that respect should be maintained in family relationships, then yes. If we consider the context of enduring abuse and the right to self-preservation, maybe not. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions are justified by their circumstances.\n"
