My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is about treating their mother with zero respect, so I need to consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the mother's situation: She hasn't worked for 40 years since marrying the dad. The dad is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mother complains about his income and her lifestyle, and she's described as acting like a petulant child. She has no hobbies and focuses on wealth, with friends who are other neighborhood wives. She shows no real interest in her children's lives and criticizes them, like the author's promotion being a negative point. The author is across the country, visits once a year, and now responds by being disrespectful, avoiding her, and showing disdain.\n\nThe author argues that they're justified because of the mother's behavior. They've had 20 years of this before moving out, and even now, visiting is a negative experience. They feel it's time to stop catering to her behavior.\n\nOn the one hand, respect is important in family relationships. The mother's lack of support and her negativity could be contributing factors. But on the other hand, the author is choosing to be disrespectful, which might not be the healthiest way to handle it. Even if the mother is difficult, treating someone with zero respect can damage relationships and may not lead to positive change. The author might benefit from setting boundaries without being disrespectful, maybe through communication or limiting interactions.\n\nBut the mother's behavior is clearly problematic. She's not supportive, shows no interest in her children, and is constantly negative. The author's feelings of resentment are understandable. However, the way they're handling it\u2014openly despising her and avoiding her completely\u2014could be seen as taking it too far. There's a difference between not engaging and being disrespectful. Maybe the author isn't wrong for feeling that way, but acting out in a disrespectful manner is where they might be in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because even if the mother is difficult, the author's choice to show no respect is not appropriate. However, some might argue B (not in the wrong) because the mother's behavior is so terrible. But traditionally, family respect is expected regardless of the behavior, so the author's actions might be seen as wrong even if the mother is at fault.\n"
