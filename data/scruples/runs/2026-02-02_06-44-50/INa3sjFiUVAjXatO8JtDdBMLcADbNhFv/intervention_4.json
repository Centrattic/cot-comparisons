My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation is a bit complex. The author's mom hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying the dad. The dad is the sole provider, and the mom is described as complaining about money and not showing interest in the kids' lives. The author has had a hard time visiting and now treats their mom with disdain, avoiding interaction and showing contempt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. From the author's perspective, the mom is neglectful, negative, and unappreciative. The author feels that their dad is the one working hard, and the mom is taking it for granted. The author's resentment has built up over 20 years, leading to a complete lack of respect during visits. The author is now open about hating their mom's presence and avoiding her entirely during visits.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points are respect towards a parent and how to handle family issues. In many cultures, respect for parents is a strong value, even if the parent isn't perfect. The author's behavior\u2014leaving the room when the mom enters, showing no interest, and being openly disrespectful\u2014could be seen as wrong because it's harmful and could escalate family tensions. However, the mom's behavior is also problematic: she's neglectful, critical, and uninvolved in her children's lives.\n\nBut the question is about the author's actions. Even if the mom is at fault, the author's response might still be considered wrong. Disrespecting a parent can cause emotional harm and is generally frowned upon. The author might be justified in feeling frustrated, but the way they handle it (complete avoidance and contempt) could be seen as inappropriate. The author should consider healthier ways to manage their emotions, maybe setting boundaries or communication, rather than cutting off all interaction disrespectfully. So, while the mom has issues, the author's actions are still problematic. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to check if the reasoning holds. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, and the analysis supports that.\n"
