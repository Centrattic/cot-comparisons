My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. Let me start by reading the details carefully.\n\nThe author's mom hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying their dad. The dad is the sole provider, doing most of the housework. The mom is critical of him, complains about not having enough money, and is described as acting like a child. The author finds this repulsive and is only visiting once a year from across the country. They mention that the mom isn't interested in their lives, only criticizes, and the author has been avoiding interaction, leaving the room when she enters. The key issue is whether the author is in the wrong for this behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms regarding family respect. Generally, there's an expectation to treat family with respect, even if you disagree with them. However, there's also consideration for abuse or toxic behavior. The author's mom's behavior is described as negative and critical, maybe even emotionally harmful. But does that justify the author's complete disrespect?\n\nThe author has a history of resentment, having lived with her for 20 years. Now that they can move out, they're avoiding her. However, cutting off entirely or treating her with zero respect might be seen as harsh. The situation is complex. The mom's behavior is problematic, but the author's response could be counterproductive, potentially harming family relationships further.\n\nOn one hand, the author has valid reasons for frustration. On the other, the way they're handling it might be extreme. There's a middle ground, like setting boundaries while maintaining some level of respect. The author's approach leaves no room for possible reconciliation or managing the situation with more dignity. So, while the mom's actions are inexcusable, the author might still be in the wrong for their own disrespectful behavior. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
