My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with no respect. The situation is pretty complex. The author's mom hasn't worked in 40 years, relies on the dad for everything, complains a lot, and doesn't seem to care about the kids' lives. The author is now responding by being completely cold and avoiding interaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In many cultures, respecting parents is a big deal. But there's also the aspect of abuse or neglect. The mom's behavior sounds toxic\u2014constantly criticizing, no empathy, focusing only on wealth. The author's response is understandable given the years of negative treatment. But is it justified? \n\nOn one hand, the author is an adult now, and cutting off communication is their right. On the other, completely ignoring a parent might be seen as disrespectful. However, the mom's behavior might have contributed to the author's resentment. The key point is whether the author's actions are a reasonable response to years of neglect and negativity. The author mentions putting up with it for 20 years, so it's not a sudden reaction. \n\nBut society often expects some level of respect even if the parent is flawed. The author's approach is extreme, though. They're not just being cold; they're openly showing disdain and avoiding interaction. Maybe there's a middle ground where the author can set boundaries without being completely dismissive. However, given the mom's behavior, the author's feelings are valid. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the question is about moral wrongdoing, it's subjective. The mom's actions are definitely harmful, but the author's response is still a choice. Some might argue the author is protecting their mental health, others might say they should try to be polite. But given the context, the author's actions are a reaction to long-term mistreatment. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but it's a close call. Need to make sure there's no missed nuance here.\n"
