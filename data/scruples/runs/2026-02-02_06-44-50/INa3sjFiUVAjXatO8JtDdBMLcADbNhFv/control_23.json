My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author treating their mother with no respect because of her behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years, the father does most of the work and supports the family. The mother is critical of the father's income and complains about her lifestyle. She's described as acting like a petulant child, has no hobbies except talking about wealth with friends, and isn't interested in the author's life. The author feels resentful and during visits, they barely speak to their mom, avoid her, and openly show dislike. They feel it's justified after enduring this for 20 years and only visiting once a year.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Family relationships are complex. While the mother's behavior is clearly problematic and could contribute to the author's frustration, the author's response is to show zero respect, avoid interaction, and express disdain. The question is whether this response is justified or if the author is overreacting.\n\nOn one hand, the mother's behavior is hurtful and neglectful. On the other hand, the author's approach of complete disengagement and open hostility might be seen as extreme. Resentment can be valid, but how one expresses it matters. The author might feel justified, but cutting off communication entirely, even with family, can have its own issues. However, the mother isn't making an effort either. The father's role isn't mentioned in terms of supporting the author.\n\nCultural context might play a role too. In some cultures, disrespect towards parents is considered wrong regardless of the parent's behavior. But in others, mutual respect is key. The line between standing up for oneself and being disrespectful is blurry here. The author's actions might be seen as self-preservation rather than disrespect. However, the fact that they are treating their mother this way despite living far away and only seeing her once a year complicates things. It's possible the author's actions are a form of self-protection, but maybe there's a middle ground, like setting boundaries without total disengagement.\n\nIn the end, while the mother's behavior is awful, the author's complete lack of respect might not be justified. People might say the author is in the wrong because even in bad relationships, some level of respect is expected. Others might argue that the mother's actions warrant such a response. But generally, treating a parent with zero respect is looked down upon, so the answer might lean towards A. However, considering the mother's behavior, some might say the author isn't in the wrong (B). It's a tough call. The key is whether the author's actions are an appropriate response. Since the author is expressing justified anger but in a disrespectful way, maybe A is correct. But the question is about being in the wrong. If the author is acting out of justified anger, maybe they're not in the wrong. Hmm.\n"
