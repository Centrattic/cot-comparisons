My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation is pretty detailed. The author's mom hasn't worked in 40 years, the dad is the sole provider, and the mom complains about money, lacks hobbies, and isn't interested in the kids' lives. The author is visiting once a year and is so frustrated they avoid their mom completely, showing disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around family relationships. Generally, respect is expected even if there's conflict. The author's actions\u2014barely talking, leaving the room, showing dislike openly\u2014seem harsh. Even if the mother isn't a great parent, treating someone with zero respect might be seen as wrong.\n\nBut then, the mother's behavior isn't great either. She's neglectful, critical, and negative. The author had to endure this for years. There's a concept of \"cycle of abuse\" where poor treatment can lead to resentment. However, the author's response is extreme. Disrespecting someone, even a parent, is typically frowned upon socially. The author might be justified in feeling angry, but their actions cross into disrespect.\n\nAlso, the fact that they only visit once a year might reduce the severity. Maybe they're under pressure during visits. But the way they handle it\u2014openly showing disdain\u2014could harm family dynamics and isn't a healthy way to deal with issues. There's also the aspect of personal responsibility; even if the parent is at fault, the child's actions have consequences.\n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation to maintain a certain level of respect for parents regardless of their behavior. So, while the mother's behavior is problematic, the author's complete lack of respect might be considered wrong. However, if the mother's actions were abusive, the author might have a different perspective. But based on the description, it's more about neglect and criticism rather than abuse. So, the author's response is disproportionate, hence they are in the wrong.\n"
