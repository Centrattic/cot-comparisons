My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mom with zero respect. The situation is complicated.\n\nFirst, the author's mom hasn't worked since marrying their dad 40 years ago. The dad does most of the work and provides income, while the mom is described as complaining about money and not supporting her kids. The author feels exhausted from visiting her every year and now is being disrespectful\u2014ignoring her, leaving when she enters, etc.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The mom's behavior sounds toxic\u2014constant complaints, lack of support, and maybe emotional neglect. That's really hard on the kids. But the author's response is to cut her off completely, which is disrespectful and could hurt the mom. The author might feel justified because of the years of putdowns and neglect.\n\nOn the other hand, even if the mom is difficult, the author's actions could be harmful. Disrespecting a parent is generally frowned upon, regardless of the circumstances. The author might not be handling their frustration in a healthy way. Maybe they need to find a better approach, like setting boundaries without being disrespectful. But is it wrong to treat someone poorly if they've been emotionally abusive?\n\nThe key point is whether the author's actions are justified. The mom's behavior is clearly problematic, but the solution of total disrespect might not be the right one. The author should address the issues constructively, maybe through communication or limiting contact. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they're treating their mom with zero respect, it's likely they're at fault. Even if the mom is the source of the problem, the way the author is responding is not appropriate. So the answer might be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
