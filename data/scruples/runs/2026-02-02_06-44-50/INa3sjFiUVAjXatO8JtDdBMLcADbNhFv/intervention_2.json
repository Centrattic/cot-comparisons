My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author's mom hasn't worked since marrying their dad 40 years ago. The dad is the sole provider, handling most of the cooking and cleaning. The mom is critical of his income and her lifestyle, acts petulantly, and the author finds her repulsive during visits. The author lives far away, visits once a year, and now barely interacts with her, avoiding her and showing disdain. They used to put up with her for 20 years before moving out. The author feels their mom doesn't care about their or their siblings' lives and gives negative comments, like criticizing a promotion.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong but wants opinions. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nHmm. So, on one hand, the author's mom has a lot of flaws: she's unemployable for 40 years, depends on her husband, is critical, and lacks interest in her kids' lives. But the author is treating her with zero respect\u2014avoiding her, showing disdain, not even talking. That seems harsh, even if the mom is difficult.\n\nBut maybe the author's behavior is a reaction to years of neglect and negativity. However, cutting off or belittling family, even if they're problematic, can lead to further issues. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The mom's behavior is definitely problematic, but the author's response is disrespectful. The author might be justified in feeling hurt, but treating someone with zero respect isn't healthy. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they're not engaging respectfully, even if the mom is at fault. But there's nuance here. The answer could go either way, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions are disrespectful, so maybe A is the answer.\n"
