My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author treating their mother with zero respect. The mother is described as not working, complaining about her husband's income, being negative, and not interested in her children's lives. The author avoids her during visits and shows disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider family dynamics. Respect is a key component in relationships, especially between parents and children. Even if the mother's behavior is problematic, does that justify the author's disrespectful treatment? The mother might have issues, but the author's actions\u2014like avoiding interaction and expressing hatred\u2014could be seen as wrong. Parents can have flaws, but children are still expected to show respect regardless of the parents' behavior. \n\nHowever, there's the aspect of the mother's behavior. If she's been neglectful and negative, maybe the author's frustration is understandable. But that doesn't excuse disrespectful behavior. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. In many cultural contexts, disrespecting a parent is considered a fault, regardless of the parent's actions. \n\nThe author might need to seek a better way to handle the situation, like setting boundaries without being disrespectful. But the act of showing zero respect and hatred is generally considered wrong. So the answer would lean towards A, the author is in the wrong. But maybe there's a balance here. The mother's behavior is bad, but the author's response is also not acceptable. So the author is in the wrong for their disrespectful treatment despite the mother's issues.\n"
