My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the person is asking if treating their mother with zero respect is acceptable. The situation describes a mother who hasn't worked in decades, relies on her husband's income, and is described as complaining and not supportive. The author has a strained relationship and reacts by being dismissive and avoiding interaction during visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The mother's behavior is definitely problematic\u2014complaining, lack of support, and having no hobbies. But the author's response is to show no respect, which includes ignoring, leaving the room, and not hiding their disdain. \n\nRespect in a family relationship usually involves a basic level of courtesy and consideration, even if there are issues. The author's approach seems to be cutting off all communication, which might be an extreme reaction. However, they've also endured this behavior for years, and the mother doesn't seem to have changed her ways. \n\nOn the other hand, completely withdrawing respect might not address the underlying issues and could escalate tension. The author might be hurt and frustrated, but their actions could be seen as hostile. But given the mother's behavior, maybe the author feels justified. \n\nI should also think about the impact on the relationship. If the mother doesn't reciprocate respect, does that justify the author's actions? Or is there a better way to handle it, like setting boundaries without showing disdain? \n\nIn many cultures, respecting family is expected, even if the other person is difficult. However, the definition of respect can vary. The author might believe that respect is conditional based on the mother's behavior. \n\nSo, weighing both sides: the mother's behavior is clearly hurtful, but the author's response is extreme and disrespectful. There's a middle ground where one can set boundaries without showing contempt. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for their reaction, even if the mother's actions were the trigger.\n"
