My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault for treating their mother with zero respect. Their mom has been staying home for 40 years since marrying their dad. The dad has been the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mom is always complaining about his income and wants a more lavish lifestyle. She has no hobbies and talks about wealth with her friends. The author finds her behavior repulsive, especially during visits. They mention that the mom doesn't show interest in their or their siblings' lives. An example given is when the author got a promotion, the mom criticized them for taking too long. The author has been avoiding interaction with the mom, leaving the room when she enters, and openly expressing disdain. They feel they've had to endure this for 20 years and want to put an end to it.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author's mom's behavior is certainly problematic. She's a stay-at-home mom who's never had a job, relies on her husband's income, complains about it, and is dismissive of her children's achievements. That's not a healthy dynamic, and the author has legitimate reasons to feel frustrated and resentful.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author is responding by treating their mother with zero respect. They're being openly disrespectful, avoiding interaction, and showing disdain. Even if the mom is difficult, treating someone with no respect can be harmful. Family relationships are complex, and while the mom's behavior is bad, the author's approach might not be the healthiest way to handle it. However, the author's actions could also be a result of long-term emotional abuse and neglect. It's possible they're protecting their own mental health by setting boundaries, even if it comes off as disrespectful.\n\nI should also consider cultural norms. In some cultures, respecting elders and parents is paramount, but in others, individual well-being is prioritized. The author's mom might have contributed to a toxic environment, so the author's response could be seen as a defense mechanism. But is cutting off communication in this way fair? The author isn't trying to hide their dislike, which could be hurtful to the mother. However, the mother's behavior has been persistent and negative over decades. The author's actions might be a form of self-preservation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They are treating their mother disrespectfully, which is not ideal. However, the mother's behavior is also contributing to the problem. The author's actions might stem from valid reasons, but the way they're handling it could be improved. Maybe there's a middle ground where they can set boundaries without being openly disrespectful. But given the context, the mother's behavior has been a long-term issue, so the author's response isn't entirely without justification. However, completely disengaging and showing open disdain might not be the best approach. There's a balance between protecting oneself and maintaining some level of respect. \n\nI think the author is partially at fault because while the mother's behavior is problematic, the author's response could be more constructive. Disrespect can perpetuate a cycle of negativity. So, even if the mother is difficult, the author could work on setting boundaries in a healthier way. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because their response, while understandable, is disrespectful and could be harmful. They might need to find a better approach to handle the situation.\n"
