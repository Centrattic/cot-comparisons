My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author's mom hasn't worked since marrying their dad 40 years ago. The dad is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mom is portrayed as complaining about money, being petulant, and not interested in the author's life. The author has visited once a year, but after 20 years of putting up with her, they now treat her with disrespect\u2014avoiding her, not talking, and showing disdain. They mention feeling put down by her comments on their promotion.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral or social expectations around family respect. Generally, people are expected to show respect to family members, even if they're difficult. But there are nuances. The author's mom seems to have a lot of negative traits\u2014complaining, not supporting her kids, being dismissive. The author's behavior is a reaction to years of this, which could be seen as self-defense or a way to protect their mental health.\n\nHowever, cutting off communication entirely, even in person, might be extreme. But given the context, maybe the author's actions are understandable. The key points are the mom's behavior and the author's response. The author isn't just being disrespectful without cause; they've had a lifetime of negative interactions. \n\nBut society often expects people to maintain a level of respect regardless. Even if the mom is terrible, the author's actions could be seen as disrespectful. However, the author's mental health and well-being are also factors. There's a balance between respecting family and protecting oneself from toxicity. \n\nIn some cultures, family ties are very strong, and cutting someone off is a big deal. But in others, especially when there's abuse or neglect, it's more accepted. The author's mom isn't necessarily abusive, but the emotional neglect and constant criticism can be harmful. \n\nThe author's response might be justified as a way to set boundaries. However, the way they're approaching it\u2014avoiding her, not engaging\u2014might not be the healthiest approach, but it's their choice. The question is whether they're \"in the wrong.\" \n\nSo, considering the mom's behavior and the author's justified frustration, the author's actions might be seen as a reaction to being mistreated. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that disrespect is always wrong, regardless of the cause. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the key here is the context of the mom's behavior and the author's history of enduring it. The author's actions are a response to a toxic environment. While respect is generally important, the mother's lack of support and negativity could justify the author's stance. So, the answer is B.\n"
