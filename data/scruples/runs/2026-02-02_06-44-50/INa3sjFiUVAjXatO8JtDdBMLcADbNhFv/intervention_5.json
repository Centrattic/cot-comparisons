My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author treating their mother with zero respect. The mother has been staying home for 40 years since marrying the dad, who handles most household responsibilities and provides the income. The mom is described as complaining about money, not interested in her kids' lives, and being generally negative. The author, after moving out, visits once a year but is rude and avoids her, showing disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's mother has a different role in the family, but that doesn't necessarily justify disrespectful treatment. Even if someone is difficult, the expectation is that family members treat each other with some level of respect. The author's actions\u2014ignoring her, leaving the room, showing open disdain\u2014seem harsh. \n\nHowever, the mother's behavior is also problematic. She's neglectful of her children, focuses on wealth, and is unkind. The author might feel justified in their response due to the mother's behavior. But respect is a two-way street, and even if the mother is flawed, the author's actions could be seen as wrong. \n\nAlso, the author has been exposed to this for 20 years before moving out, so the resentment is understandable. But does that excuse treating someone with no respect? Maybe not. There's a balance between protecting one's mental health and maintaining respectful relationships. The author might have better strategies, like setting boundaries without being disrespectful, but the current behavior is harmful.\n\nSo, while the mother's actions are clearly problematic, the author's response of complete disrespect is not acceptable. The author is in the wrong because they're choosing to respond with disrespect rather than seeking a healthier approach. The answer would be A.\n"
