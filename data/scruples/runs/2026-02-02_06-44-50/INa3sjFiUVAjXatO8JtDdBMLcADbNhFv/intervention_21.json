My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation is detailed in the given story.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's mother has been described as someone who never works, relies on her husband for everything, complains about his income, and shows little interest in her children's lives. The author feels neglected and frustrated, leading them to treat their mother poorly during visits.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is wrong. The key points here are the mother's behavior and the author's response. The mother's actions\u2014being demanding, uninvolved, and negative\u2014might have contributed to the author's feelings of resentment. However, the author's response is to completely cut off communication, leave the room, and show open disdain. That's a lot of disrespect, even if the mother isn't perfect.\n\nBut family dynamics are complex. While the mother's behavior is clearly problematic, the author's reaction could have long-term consequences, especially regarding their relationship with their parents and siblings. The author is in their 20s, having left home, and might feel justified in their actions due to years of neglect. However, treating a parent with zero respect is generally considered wrong, regardless of the parent's faults. Society often emphasizes respect for parents, even in difficult situations.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's behavior is also a significant factor. If she's been emotionally abusive or neglectful, that can lead to justified feelings of anger and resentment. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way they're handling it is extreme. There might be healthier ways to set boundaries without completely cutting off communication, like having a calm conversation or limiting interactions during visits to protect their mental health.\n\nSo, considering both sides, while the mother's actions are part of the problem, the author's treatment of her might still be wrong. However, there's context. The answer might depend on cultural norms, but generally, the author is showing disrespect, which is typically considered wrong regardless of the reasons. But the mother's behavior isn't all blameless either. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe it's a gray area. However, since the question is a yes or no, and the options are A (yes) or B (no), I need to pick one.\n\nHmm. The key here is that treating someone with zero respect is wrong, regardless of the circumstances. So even if the mother is difficult, the author's actions are still inappropriate. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
