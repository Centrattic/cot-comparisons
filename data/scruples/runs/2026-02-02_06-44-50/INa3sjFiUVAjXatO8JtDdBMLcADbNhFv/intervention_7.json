My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author treating their mother with zero respect. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe mom hasn't worked since marrying the dad 40 years ago. The dad handles most of the cooking, cleaning, and is the sole income provider. The mom constantly complains about the dad's salary and her lifestyle, acting like a child. The author finds it repulsive and only visits once a year. They've been put through this for 20 years, which might explain why they're now being disrespectful\u2014avoiding conversation, leaving the room, showing disdain.\n\nFirst, I should consider the mom's behavior. She's not working, relying on her husband's income, has no hobbies, and is negative. That's pretty harmful. The author mentions the mom's lack of interest in their lives and critical comments, which could be emotionally damaging.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's response is cutting off interaction, which is disrespectful. Even if the mom is awful, treating someone with zero respect isn't right. The author might be justified in feeling hurt, but the way they're acting is unkind. The post is about the author's disrespectful behavior, so the main question is whether they're wrong for that.\n\nBut maybe the mom's behavior is so bad that it's understandable? However, the author has the option to limit interactions, but completely avoiding and showing disdain is extreme. The key here is that regardless of the mom's faults, the author's actions are not appropriate. People should be treated with basic respect, even if they're difficult. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because their behavior is disrespectful despite the mom's issues.\n"
