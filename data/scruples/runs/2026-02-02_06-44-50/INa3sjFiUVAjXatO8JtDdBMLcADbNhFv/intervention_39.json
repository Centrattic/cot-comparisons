My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a strained relationship with their mother. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years, relies on the dad for income, is critical, and the author is treating her with zero respect by avoiding interaction and showing disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014she's neglectful, critical, and lacks interests beyond material things. The author has a valid reason for feeling resentful, given the mom's lack of support and constant criticism. However, the author's response is to cut her off completely during visits and show open contempt. While the mother's actions are hurtful, treating someone with zero respect, especially a family member, can have its own consequences. \n\nThe key question is whether the author's actions are justified given the mother's behavior. While it's understandable to be upset, completely avoiding interaction and showing disdain might not be the healthiest approach for the author or others involved. But considering the mother's behavior, the author might feel justified. However, the author's response is extreme and disrespectful regardless of the mother's actions. So, there's a balance between self-care and respecting familial bonds. The author might be in the wrong because even if the mother is difficult, showing zero respect isn't appropriate. Alternatively, if the author is protecting their mental health, it's a complex situation. \n\nGiven that the author is treating their mother with no respect, which is disrespectful regardless of the mother's faults, the answer might be A. But some might argue it's self-preservation. However, the question asks if the author is in the wrong. The author's actions are disrespectful, so they might be in the wrong. So, Answer A.\n"
