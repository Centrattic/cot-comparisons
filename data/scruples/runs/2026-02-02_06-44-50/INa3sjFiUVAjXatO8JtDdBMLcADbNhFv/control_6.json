As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The person is asking if they're the asshole for treating their mom with zero respect. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mom hasn't worked since marrying the dad 40 years ago. The dad handles most of the cooking, cleaning, and is the sole income provider. The mom is constantly criticizing the dad for not making enough and complaining about her life not being lavish. She's described as acting like a petulant child, especially during the holidays when the author visits once a year. The mom has no hobbies besides talking about wealth with friends who are similar. She doesn't show interest in the author's or siblings' lives. The last promotion the author got was met with criticism from the mom about taking too long. The author is so fed up that they barely talk to the mom, avoid her, and openly show dislike. They feel like they had to put up with this for 20 years before moving out, and now they're not hiding their disdain.\n\nSo, the question is: is the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nOn one hand, the mom's behavior is problematic. She's not contributing financially, is critical, and doesn't support her children. The author has valid frustrations. On the other hand, treating someone with zero respect and avoiding them entirely might be seen as cutting off a family relationship, which could be harsh. However, given the mom's behavior, the author's actions could be a form of self-preservation. \n\nBut in terms of societal expectations, there's often an expectation to maintain family relationships despite issues. However, the mom's actions are toxic. The author is an adult, so they have the autonomy to set boundaries. The key point is whether the author's response is proportionate. The mom's behavior is clearly hurtful, so the author's resentment is understandable. However, completely cutting off communication and showing disdain might be seen as extreme, but if the mom is toxic, it could be justified. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, sometimes the person is in the right if they're the victim of abuse or neglect. Here, the mom's behavior is emotionally abusive. The author is protecting themselves. So the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the mom's actions are the root cause. But some might argue that even if the mom is bad, the author should try to be respectful. However, respect is mutual. If the mom is disrespectful, the author isn't obligated to show it. \n\nAnother angle: the author is an adult and can choose how to interact. They're not ignoring the mom out of spite but due to years of mistreatment. So the answer is likely B.\n"
