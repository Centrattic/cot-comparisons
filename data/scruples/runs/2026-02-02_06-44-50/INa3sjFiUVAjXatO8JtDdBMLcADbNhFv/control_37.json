My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The author is a child who's treating their mother with zero respect. The mother hasn't worked for 40 years, relying on the father for income. The mom is described as complaining about money, not interested in the kids' lives, and having no hobbies. The author is visiting once a year but is rude and avoids her, showing disdain.\n\nHmm, so I need to decide if the author is wrong. First, the mother's behavior is clearly problematic. She's not contributing, complains a lot, and neglects her children's achievements. The author has valid reasons for feeling upset. But respect is important regardless of the situation. Even if the mother is difficult, the author's response of avoiding conversation and showing open disdain might be seen as disrespectful. However, the mother's actions have likely contributed to the author's feelings. \n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation to respect parents despite differences. But emotional neglect and criticism can erode that respect. The author might feel justified in setting boundaries, but cutting off communication entirely during visits might be extreme. Maybe a middle ground would be better, but the question is about being in the wrong. The mother's behavior is part of the context. So, considering both sides, the author's actions are hurtful, but the mother's behavior is part of the problem. However, the author is still responsible for their own actions. So perhaps the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they're not respecting their mother, even if the mother is at fault. But some might argue the mother's actions justify it. It's a tough call. The key is whether the author is \"in the wrong\" regardless of the mother's behavior. Ethically, treating a parent with zero respect is generally considered wrong, even if the parent is flawed. So the answer is A.\n"
