My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is treating their mother with zero respect, avoiding interaction, and showing disdain. The mother is described as having certain negative behaviors, but the key question is whether the author's response is justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years, relies on her husband's income, and is criticized for not having a lavish lifestyle. She's also dismissive of her children's achievements. The author feels resentful and has a right to feel upset, but their actions\u2014like cutting off communication and showing open disdain\u2014could be problematic.\n\nRespect is important in family relationships, even when there are issues. The author's approach might be seen as disrespectful, regardless of the mother's behavior. However, the mother's actions could contribute to the author's feelings. But does that justify the lack of respect? Maybe not. The author might need to express their feelings in a healthier way rather than completely disengaging, which can hurt others and damage the relationship further.\n\nAlso, considering the age difference and the fact that the mother might still be a parent, there's a societal expectation of respect towards parents. However, that's not a legal requirement, more of a cultural norm. The author's mental health is important, and if the visits are toxic, maybe they need to set boundaries without being disrespectful. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions are a justified response given the circumstances.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because their actions are disrespectful, even if the mother has flaws. But it's a nuanced situation where both parties have issues. However, the question is about the author's responsibility. Since the author is actively disengaging and showing disdain, which is disrespectful, the answer would likely be A (they are in the wrong). But maybe there's a middle ground where they can set boundaries without being disrespectful. The key is whether the author's behavior is acceptable. Given the information, the author's approach is not respectful, so they might be in the wrong.\n"
