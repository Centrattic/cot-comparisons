My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The author is treating their mother with zero respect, avoiding her, and showing open disdain during visits. The mother in question hasn't worked since marrying the dad, relies on him for everything, and is described as negative and uninterested in her children's lives.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's mother is portrayed as emotionally neglectful and possibly parasitic, only caring about wealth and criticizing her children. The mother's behavior is definitely problematic. However, the author's response is to completely cut off communication and show hostility. Is that justified?\n\nOn one hand, the mother's actions are hurtful and disrespectful, which can be a valid reason for the author to feel resentment. But on the other hand, treating a family member with zero respect, especially a parent, can have its own negative consequences. The author is choosing to act out their frustration in a way that's disrespectful and potentially harmful to family relationships. Even if the mother is at fault, the author's approach might not be the healthiest or most constructive.\n\nThere are other ways to set boundaries without complete disdain. Maybe the author could express their feelings calmly or limit interactions without being overtly hostile. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a societal or ethical standpoint, while the mother's behavior is bad, the author's actions are still disrespectful towards a family member. However, if the mother's behavior is toxic and the author is protecting their mental health, some might argue it's justified.\n\nBut the key point is that the author is choosing to treat their mother with no respect, which is not excused by the mother's behavior. Even in abusive situations, maintaining some level of respect can be important for personal and family well-being. So, the author might be in the wrong because their response is extreme and disrespectful, regardless of the mother's faults. However, others might see it as self-preservation. The answer might hinge on whether the author's actions are considered an appropriate boundary or an overreaction.\n"
