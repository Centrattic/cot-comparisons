My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The person is treating their mother with zero respect, avoiding her, and showing disdain during visits. The mother is described as someone who's never worked, depends on the father, is critical, and has a negative attitude. The user is conflicted\u2014should the author be in the wrong?\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many cultures, respect for parents is expected regardless of their behavior. But then again, abuse or toxic behavior might shift that. The mother's actions are negative, but is that justification for the author's disrespectful treatment? \n\nThe author mentions that the mother doesn't engage with their lives and is critical. This could lead to resentment. However, cutting off or being disrespectful might not be the healthiest response. Maybe there's a middle ground, like setting boundaries without complete disengagement. \n\nAlso, the author is only visiting once a year. Maybe they're trying to minimize contact, which is understandable given the stress. But the way they're handling it\u2014leaving the room, not talking\u2014might be seen as disrespectful. It's possible the author feels justified given the mother's behavior, but respect is often about maintaining dignity even in conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother isn't without fault. Her behavior is clearly harmful. But the question is whether the author is wrong. If we go by strict definitions, treating a parent with disrespect is typically considered wrong, even if the parent is at fault. However, in cases of toxic dynamics, some might argue it's a form of self-preservation. \n\nI need to weigh both sides. The author's actions are hurtful, but the mother's behavior is also problematic. The answer might depend on cultural values and personal ethics. In many societies, respect is expected regardless, so the answer could be A. But others might see it as justified, leading to B. I'm leaning towards A, as the author is actively disrespecting their mother, which is generally frowned upon, but the context is complex.\n"
