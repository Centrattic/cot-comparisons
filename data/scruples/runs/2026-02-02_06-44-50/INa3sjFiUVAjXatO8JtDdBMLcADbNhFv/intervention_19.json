My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the author's mom hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying the dad. The dad is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mom is described as complaining about her life not being lavish enough and not having hobbies. She's also not supportive of the author's achievements, like their last promotion. The author is so fed up that they avoid interaction, leave the room when she enters, and openly show disdain.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. They want to know if that's the case.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, treating someone with zero respect is generally not acceptable, regardless of the reasons. However, there's context here. The author's mom's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014she's neglectful, uninterested in her children's lives, and complains about her husband's income. The author has had to endure this for 20 years and now only visits once a year. The emotional toll is significant.\n\nBut even if someone's parent is difficult, responding with complete disrespect and disdain might not be the right approach. The author could be justified in feeling frustrated, but their actions\u2014like cutting off all communication and showing hatred\u2014might be excessive. There's a balance between standing up for oneself and maintaining respect, especially in family relationships. The author might need to address the issues differently, like setting boundaries without being disrespectful. However, given the mom's behavior, the author's resentment is understandable. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key point is that while the mother's actions are harmful, the author's response of complete disrespect and hatred is still not acceptable. People should strive to maintain some level of respect, even in difficult family dynamics. The author's approach might be a reaction to long-term emotional abuse, but that doesn't justify their disrespectful behavior. So, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because treating someone with zero respect is wrong regardless of the circumstances. However, the context is important. The mother's behavior is definitely part of the problem, but the author's actions are still a form of emotional harm. \n\nAlternatively, if the mother's behavior is so toxic that the author can't function without being disrespectful, maybe the answer is B. But generally, even in toxic relationships, one is expected to maintain some respect. So the author is in the wrong for their disrespectful treatment of the mother. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
