My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a person who treats their mother with zero respect because they're fed up with her behavior. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years, the father is the sole provider, and the mother constantly berates the father and is critical of her kids. The author is so upset that they avoid interacting, leave the room when the mom enters, and show clear disdain.\n\nOn one hand, the mother's behavior sounds toxic and disrespectful, especially towards her husband and children. She's not supportive and focuses only on wealth and criticism. That's definitely problematic. The author has been under her roof for 20 years and visits once a year, which is a lot of emotional strain. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for treating her poorly. Even if the mother is difficult, showing open disrespect, avoiding interaction, and expressing hatred could be seen as wrong. The author might feel justified, but treating someone with zero respect isn't healthy, even if the other person is flawed. It doesn't resolve the issue and might harm relationships further.\n\nHowever, the mother's behavior is also a significant factor. She's contributing to the toxic environment. The author's actions could be a reaction to years of neglect and criticism. It's a complex situation where both parties have issues, but the author's behavior is clearly disrespectful.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's actions are justified. While the mother is at fault for her behavior, the author's response of complete disrespect isn't appropriate either. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because everyone deserves basic respect, even if they're difficult. So, Answer A.\n"
