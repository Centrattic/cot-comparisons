My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with no respect. The situation involves a mother who hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying the father. The father does most of the household work and provides income, while the mother is described as complaining about money, being a \"petulant child,\" and not showing interest in the author's life. The author, after 20 years of living with this, now visits once a year and is very disrespectful, avoiding interaction and showing open disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior is clearly problematic. She's not contributing to the household, is critical, and lacks interest in her children's lives. The father has been the sole provider and doing most of the work. The author's frustration stems from years of this environment, leading to emotional distress and a desire to distance themselves.\n\nHowever, the author's response is to treat their mother with zero respect, avoid her, and express disdain openly. Even if the mother is difficult, the author is a grown adult. Disrespecting a family member, especially a parent, can have emotional consequences and may not be the healthiest way to handle the situation. The author might have valid reasons for their feelings, but cutting off communication entirely or being openly hostile isn't advisable. They could seek other ways to manage the visits, like setting boundaries or limiting time spent, without resorting to disrespectful treatment. It's a complex situation where both parties have issues, but the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate, even if the mother is at fault. So, while the mother's behavior is wrong, the author's approach might not be the right one. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because treating someone with zero respect is not acceptable regardless of the circumstances.\n"
