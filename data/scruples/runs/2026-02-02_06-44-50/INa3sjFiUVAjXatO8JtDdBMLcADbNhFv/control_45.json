My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mother hasn't worked for 40 years, relying on the father's income. The father does most of the cooking and cleaning. The mother is critical of his income and complains about her lifestyle. She's described as acting like a petulant child, has no hobbies, and only focuses on wealth with friends. She shows no interest in her children's lives, even criticizing one's promotion. The author, living across the country, visits once a year but now barely speaks to the mother, leaving the room when she enters, and openly showing disdain.\n\nThe key points here are the mother's behavior towards the father and children. She's clearly toxic, which affects the author's emotional well-being. The author's response is to withdraw completely, showing disrespect during visits. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong despite the mother's behavior.\n\nIn many cultural contexts, respect for parents is expected, regardless of their actions. However, this case involves a parent who's emotionally abusive and neglectful. The author's treatment might be justified as a self-preservation tactic. But from a traditional standpoint, showing no respect could be seen as wrong, even if the mother is at fault.\n\nBut considering emotional abuse and codependency, it's possible that the author's actions are a response to years of mistreatment. The mother's behavior is the root cause here, and the author is trying to protect their own mental health. However, the author's approach is extreme and could be seen as cutting off a familial relationship entirely, which might have its own consequences.\n\nI need to weigh the mother's wrongdoings against the author's actions. While the mother is clearly at fault, the author's response might be excessive. But given the mother's lack of empathy and the author's need to maintain their well-being, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. It's a nuanced situation where both parties have issues, but the mother's behavior is the primary cause of the conflict.\n"
