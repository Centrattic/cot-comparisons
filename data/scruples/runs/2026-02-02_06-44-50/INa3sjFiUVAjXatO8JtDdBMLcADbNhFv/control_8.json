My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The story is about the author treating their mother with zero respect. The mother is described as not working, relying on the father's income, and being critical and negative. The author has a hard time dealing with her and now avoids interaction during visits, showing clear dislike.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior is harmful and negative. She's critical, uninterested in her children's lives, and has a poor attitude. The author has had to endure this for years, leading to emotional distress. The father is the one providing financially, which might add to the imbalance in the family.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for withdrawing and treating their mom poorly. On one hand, respect is important in family relationships, and the author's actions are disrespectful. However, the mother's behavior is toxic. The author might be reacting to years of neglect and negativity. It's a complex situation where both parties have issues.\n\nBut the key point here is the author's response. Even if the mother is difficult, treating someone with zero respect and avoiding them completely is not the healthiest approach. The author could be in the wrong because they're choosing to retaliate with disrespect instead of setting boundaries or seeking ways to manage their visits without dehumanizing their mother. However, the mother's actions are definitely contributing to the conflict.\n\nI think the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because while the mother's behavior is bad, the author's response is also harmful. The question is about whether the author is wrong. Even if the mother is at fault, the author isn't justified in treating her poorly. It's possible to disengage without being disrespectful. So the author might be wrong for their actions despite the mother's faults.\n"
