My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The author describes their mother's behavior as disrespectful, complaining, and dismissive of their achievements. The mother hasn't worked for 40 years, relies on their dad's income, and the author feels treated poorly. They've been avoiding interaction and are now being openly disrespectful.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the mother's behavior sounds toxic and hurtful. She's not supportive, is critical, and lacks hobbies or interests beyond wealth. The author is an adult now, living far away, and their interactions are limited. They're dealing with the emotional burden of visiting and facing negativity each time. It's understandable they feel frustrated.\n\nBut the author's response is to treat their mother with zero respect\u2014avoiding conversation, leaving the room, showing disdain. While their feelings are valid, the way they're handling it might be seen as disrespectful. Even if the mother is difficult, cutting off or being openly hostile might not be the healthiest approach. \n\nHowever, considering the context: the author is an adult, not under their mother's care anymore. They're trying to set boundaries after years of negativity. The mother's behavior is indeed problematic. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. It's a bit of a grey area. Some might say the author is justified in protecting their own mental health, while others might argue that respect should be maintained regardless of the mother's actions.\n\nI think the key here is that while the mother's behavior is terrible, the author's response is also disrespectful. The right approach might be to set boundaries without being openly hostile. But since the user asked if the author is in the wrong, I need to decide if their actions cross a line. The problem is that the author is choosing to completely cut off communication and show contempt, which isn't necessarily the best way to handle it, even if the mother is at fault. So maybe the answer is A, yes, they're in the wrong for their disrespectful treatment, even if the mother's behavior is part of the issue.\n"
