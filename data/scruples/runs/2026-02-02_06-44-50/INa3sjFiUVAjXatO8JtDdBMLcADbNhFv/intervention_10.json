My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for treating their mom with zero respect. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author mentions that their mom hasn't had a job for 40 years since marrying their dad. The dad is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mom is constantly criticizing him for not earning enough and is described as a \"petulant child.\" The author finds her behavior repulsive and is fed up with her negativity. They live far away, visit once a year, and during those visits, they barely talk to her, avoid her, and openly show disdain. The author feels this is justified because of the mom's behavior over the years.\n\nFirst, I should consider the mom's actions. If she's been critical, uninterested in her children's lives, and focused on wealth, that's definitely a problem. The dad is the one handling most responsibilities, which might contribute to the mom's negative attitude. However, the author's response is to completely cut off communication and show open disdain. Even if the mom is difficult, is it acceptable for the child to treat them with zero respect?\n\nRespecting family members is often seen as a social norm, regardless of their behavior. The author's actions\u2014leaving the room when the mom enters, not engaging\u2014are clear signs of disrespect. While the mom's behavior is clearly problematic, the author's response might be seen as disproportionate. It's important to consider the balance between standing up for oneself and maintaining basic respect in family relationships. Even if one is exhausted by a parent's behavior, completely cutting off communication and showing contempt can damage family bonds further. The author might need to address the issues in a healthier way rather than resorting to complete disrespect. So, while the mom is at fault for her behavior, the author might still be in the wrong for how they're responding.\n"
