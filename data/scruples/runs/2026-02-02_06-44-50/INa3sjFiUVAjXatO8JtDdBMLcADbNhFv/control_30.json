My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The story is about someone treating their mother with zero respect because they have issues with her behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The mother hasn't worked since marrying the father 40 years ago. The dad is the sole provider, and the mother complains about his income and her lifestyle. She's described as a negative influence, not interested in her children's lives, and only focused on wealth. The author visits once a year but is so fed up that they avoid interacting, leave the room when she enters, and show open disdain.\n\nSo, the author is treating their mother poorly because of her behavior. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nHmm. From a typical moral standpoint, treating a parent with zero respect is generally considered wrong, regardless of the parent's behavior. However, the situation is complex. The mother's behavior is toxic and may have contributed to the author's resentment. The author is in their 20s, having left home, and the visits are once a year. The mother's actions are described as negative and dismissive towards the author's achievements.\n\nBut does that justify the author's disrespectful behavior? On one hand, the mother has a responsibility to be a supportive parent, which she's failing. On the other, the author is choosing to respond with contempt instead of trying to address the issues. However, given the mother's behavior, the author might feel justified. But is it acceptable to treat someone with zero respect? Maybe there's a middle ground, like setting boundaries without being disrespectful. The author's approach is extreme. They're cutting off communication entirely, which might be an overreaction, even if the mother is difficult. However, the mother's behavior is also inexcusable. \n\nIn many cultures, respect for parents is expected regardless of their actions. But in this case, the mother's behavior is harmful. The author might not be in the wrong entirely. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the answer is A, then they are in the wrong for their disrespectful treatment. If B, they aren't, given the mother's behavior.\n\nI think the answer depends on cultural norms and the severity of the mother's actions. Since the mother is described as abusive in her behavior, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. But treating someone with zero respect can have consequences. The author's approach might not be healthy either. However, considering the mother's behavior, the author might be justified in setting boundaries. So, maybe the answer is B, but I'm not 100% sure. Some would argue that even in such cases, respect is necessary. Others might say that the mother's actions make it unreasonable to expect respect.\n"
