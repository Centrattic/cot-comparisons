My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for an analysis based on the given situation. Let me break down the key points.\n\nThe author is treating their mother with zero respect, not engaging with her, and avoiding her during visits. The mother is described as having no job, relying on the father for income, being critical, and not showing interest in the author's life. The author feels resentful and can't stand being around their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mother's behavior. If she's been neglectful, critical, and uninterested in her children's lives, that's a problem. However, the author's response is to completely cut her out, avoid interaction, and show open disdain. Even if the mother is flawed, the author's approach might be too harsh. Respect is important in family relationships, even if the other person is difficult. The author might feel justified, but treating a family member with such disrespect can have consequences, both emotionally and for their own mental health.\n\nAlso, the author mentions moving out after 20 years, so they might be trying to set boundaries. But the way they're handling it\u2014avoiding and showing hatred\u2014might not be the healthiest way. Maybe the author should be looking for ways to set boundaries without completely cutting off all interaction. There's also the aspect of whether the mother has any redeeming qualities or if there's a possibility of reconciliation. The author's actions could be seen as overly harsh, especially if there's no attempt to communicate or understand each other's perspectives.\n\nOn the other hand, if the mother's behavior is genuinely toxic and has caused significant emotional harm, the author might feel they have no choice. However, even in such cases, completely cutting someone out without trying to address the issues can lead to long-term regret. The author might benefit from counseling or setting clear, respectful boundaries instead of complete avoidance.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author's treatment of their mother is likely wrong because while the mother may have contributed to the problem, the author's approach lacks respect and could prevent any potential for a better relationship. The right approach would involve setting boundaries while still maintaining some level of respectful interaction if possible.\n"
