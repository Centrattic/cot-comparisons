My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is AITA for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation is that the mother hasn't had a job for 40 years since marrying the dad, who's the sole provider. The mom is always criticizing the dad's income and being a \"petulant child.\" The author finds this repulsive and disrespectful, especially since she doesn't show interest in their lives and only criticizes, like when the author got a promotion.\n\nSo the author is now avoiding their mom during visits, barely talking, leaving the room when she enters, and openly showing disdain. They feel justified because they've been dealing with this for 20 years before moving out. The question is: is the author wrong (A) or not (B)?\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The mom's behavior is definitely problematic. She's not working, relying on the dad's income, and has a negative attitude. She's dismissive of her children's achievements and lacks hobbies, which makes her visits unpleasant. The author's resentment is understandable given the long-term exposure.\n\nHowever, the author's response is to treat their mother with no respect. They're cutting her off, avoiding interaction, and showing open disdain. While the mom's behavior is bad, the author's approach might be seen as disrespectful. Family relationships are complex, and while the mom is at fault for her behavior, completely cutting off communication\u2014even during visits\u2014might be considered extreme. The author could be in the wrong for responding with such hostility instead of trying to manage their emotions or set boundaries more respectfully.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's actions are hurtful and toxic, making the author's frustration valid. If the author is only visiting once a year and can't stand being around her, maybe it's a matter of personal boundaries. But treating someone with zero respect is generally not the right approach, regardless of the situation. So the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because despite the mom's faults, the author's response is not respectful. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because the mom's behavior justifies the author's feelings, and they have the right to protect their mental health.\n\nHmm. It's a tough call. In AITA scenarios, often the person is considered in the wrong if their actions are clearly disrespectful, even if the other party is at fault. The author's actions are disrespectful, so maybe they are in the wrong. But given the mom's behavior, perhaps the answer is B. I think it's a 50-50, but leaning towards A because treating a family member with no respect is usually frowned upon, regardless of the circumstances. However, if the author is just protecting themselves from toxicity, maybe B. I'm a bit conflicted here. But given the way the author is describing their actions, it's not just setting boundaries but actively showing disdain. So maybe A.\n"
