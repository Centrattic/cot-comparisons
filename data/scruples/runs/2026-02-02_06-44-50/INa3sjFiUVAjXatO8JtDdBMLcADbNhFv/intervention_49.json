My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation is pretty complex. The user provided a detailed story where the mother has been unemployed for 40 years, the father does most of the work, the mother is demanding and negative, and the author is now treating her poorly during visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior is definitely problematic. She's not working, relies on the father's income, complains about him not making enough, and shows little interest in her children's lives. The author feels resentful and has been mistreated for a long time. The author's actions are a response to this environment.\n\nBut the key issue is whether the author is in the wrong. Even if the mother is difficult, treating someone with zero respect, cutting them out, and showing disdain isn't acceptable. Family relationships are complicated, but completely cutting someone off or being disrespectful might not solve the problem and could lead to further issues. The author's actions might be a result of years of neglect and criticism, but does that justify their behavior? \n\nOn one hand, the mother's actions are clearly contributing to the problem. On the other hand, the author could be seen as responding in kind, which might not be healthy. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Even if the mother is at fault, the author's actions of disrespect could still be considered wrong because they're perpetuating a cycle of negativity. However, some might argue that the author is justified in setting boundaries after so many years of poor treatment.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are acceptable as a response to their mother's behavior. While the mother's actions are part of the problem, the author's complete disengagement and disrespect could be seen as their own wrongdoing. But maybe in this context, given the mother's behavior, the author is trying to protect their own mental health by setting boundaries. It's a tricky balance. However, the author is explicitly saying they despise her and avoid all interaction, which is extreme. So perhaps the author is in the wrong because their response is also harmful, even if the mother's behavior is part of the issue.\n"
