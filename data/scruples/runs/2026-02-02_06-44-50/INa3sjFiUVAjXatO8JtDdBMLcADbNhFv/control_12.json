My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author treating their mother with zero respect. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe mother hasn't worked since marrying the dad 40 years ago. Dad does most of the cooking, cleaning, and provides all the income. The mom complains about his salary and her lifestyle, acts petulant, and focuses on wealth. She has no hobbies, no interest in the kids' lives. The author mentions feeling repulsed, avoiding interactions, leaving the room when she enters, and showing clear disdain during annual visits. They haven't spoken much since moving out at 20.\n\nSo, why is the author treating their mom this way? They have a history of neglect and criticism. The mother's behavior is described as negative and uncaring. The author isn't in the same location, only visits once a year. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for their disrespectful actions.\n\nOn one hand, the mother's behavior is clearly problematic. She's been neglectful, critical, and self-centered. The author's resentment seems justified given the treatment over the years. But on the other hand, the author is openly showing disdain and disrespect, which could be seen as inappropriate regardless of the mother's actions. Family relationships can be complex, and while the mother may be at fault in her behavior, the author's response of complete disengagement and hostility might not be the right approach. However, considering the context of years of mistreatment and the author's attempts to distance themselves from a toxic environment, some might argue it's a form of self-preservation.\n\nBut society often expects children to show respect to parents, regardless of the parents' behavior. Even if the mother is terrible, the son's response might be seen as harsh. Yet, the mother's actions have contributed to this dynamic. The author isn't trying to communicate or resolve things; they're cutting off all interaction. Is that wrong? If the mother's behavior is so toxic that any interaction is harmful, maybe the author is justified. But respect in a family might require some level of civility, even if not affection. The author's actions could be seen as disrespectful, especially if there's no attempt to address the issues or seek reconciliation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author's actions are a result of justified anger and should be considered not in the wrong. The mother's behavior is the root cause here. The author is protecting their mental health by avoiding toxic interactions. In that case, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but their approach might not be the healthiest. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the mother's actions are the main problem, the author's response is a reaction to that. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
