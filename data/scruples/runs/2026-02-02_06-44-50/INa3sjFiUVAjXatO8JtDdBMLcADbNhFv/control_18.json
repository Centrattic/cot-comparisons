She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo, the author's mom hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying the dad. The dad does most of the cooking, cleaning, and provides all the income. The mom constantly complains about money and acts petulantly, especially around the holidays. The author lives far away and visits once a year but finds the mom's behavior exhausting. They mention the mom has no hobbies and only talks about wealth with other women. She's uninterested in the author's life, even criticizing their promotion. The author is so fed up that they avoid interaction, leave the room when she enters, and openly show disdain. The question is whether the author is wrong for this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom's behavior seems toxic. She's unemployed, relies on her husband's income, and has a negative attitude. The author has had to deal with this for 20 years and now distances themselves during visits. The author's actions are a response to the mom's behavior. However, treating someone with zero respect is generally seen as negative, regardless of the reasons. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nIn these kinds of situations, the key factors are the reasons behind the behavior and the balance of responsibility. The mom's behavior is clearly problematic, but the author's response is extreme. Even if someone is toxic, cutting them off completely, especially a family member, might be seen as harsh. However, the author is just visiting once a year, so the impact might be lower. The mom's actions have been ongoing for decades, contributing to the author's frustration. The author's actions are a form of self-preservation, but respect is usually expected in family relationships, regardless of the other person's behavior.\n\nBut there's a nuance here. If the mom is toxic and the author is taking steps to protect their mental health, society might be more understanding. However, completely cutting off communication and showing disdain could be seen as disrespectful. The line between self-care and disrespect can be blurry. In some perspectives, the author isn't in the wrong because they're reacting to years of neglect and negativity. Others might argue that respect should be maintained regardless of the other person's actions.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's actions are justified by the mom's behavior. If the mom is being abusive or extremely toxic, the author's response might be seen as a form of self-protection. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's actions are a direct response to the mom's behavior, then maybe they aren't in the wrong. But the general expectation is to treat family with some level of respect, even if they're difficult. So there's a conflict here between the author's feelings and societal norms.\n\nIn AITA threads, often the community looks at both sides. The mother's behavior is clearly bad, but the author's response is extreme. The author might not be in the wrong if the mom was the one causing all the problems, but the act of treating someone with zero respect is typically frowned upon. However, considering the context, some might side with the author. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the mom's behavior is so toxic, and the author is protecting their own well-being. Alternatively, A (in the wrong) because respect is expected regardless. But given the circumstances, the author's actions are a reaction to long-term issues, so B might be the answer.\n"
