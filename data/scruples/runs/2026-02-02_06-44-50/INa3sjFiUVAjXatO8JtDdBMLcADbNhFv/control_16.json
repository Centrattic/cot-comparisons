My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for treating their mom with zero respect. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author's mom has been staying at home for 40 years since marrying the dad. The dad is the sole provider, doing most of the chores. The mom complains about money, doesn't have hobbies, and is negative. The author finds her repulsive, especially during visits. They've been cutting her out, leaving the room, and not hiding their disdain. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mom isn't working, relies on her husband, and seems to be a source of negativity. The author feels neglected and frustrated, leading to disrespectful behavior. But is it okay to treat a parent that way?\n\nRespect in family relationships is important, but the author's mom's behavior might have contributed to the tension. The mom's lack of support and constant criticism could have caused the author to feel this way. However, disrespecting a parent, even if they are difficult, might not be the right approach. The author could be justified in feeling hurt, but cutting off communication entirely might not be the healthiest solution. It's a complex situation where both parties might have valid points. The author's actions are hurtful, but the mother's behavior is toxic. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. In many cultures, showing respect to parents is expected regardless of their behavior, so the answer might lean towards A. But some might argue that the mother's actions justify the author's response. I need to weigh the cultural expectations against the situation's context. The key here is that while the author has reasons to be upset, treating someone with zero respect is generally not acceptable, even if they're a parent. So the answer would be A.\n"
