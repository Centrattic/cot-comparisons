My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author treating their mother with no respect. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years, relies on the father's income, is critical of him, and shows little interest in the author's life. The author, after moving out, visits once a year but is rude and avoids interaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014being critical, having no hobbies, and not supporting her children. However, the author's response is to completely ignore and disrespect their mother. While the mother's actions are hurtful, the author's reaction might be seen as extreme. Family relationships often require some level of respect and civility, even if the other person is difficult. The author's behavior could harm their own emotional well-being and relationships, especially if they have siblings who might be affected by their actions.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's behavior is toxic, and the author has valid reasons for their frustration. They've endured a lot over the years, and setting boundaries is important. However, completely cutting off communication and showing disdain might not be the healthiest approach. There's a balance between protecting oneself from negativity and maintaining respect for family ties. The author might need to find a middle ground, like limiting visits or setting clear boundaries without being disrespectful. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, while the mother is at fault for her behavior, the author's response is also harmful. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they are treating their mother with zero respect, which can be seen as disrespectful regardless of the mother's actions, the answer might lean towards A. However, some might argue that self-preservation justifies the author's actions. But generally, even in bad relationships, complete disrespect is frowned upon. So the answer is likely A.\n"
