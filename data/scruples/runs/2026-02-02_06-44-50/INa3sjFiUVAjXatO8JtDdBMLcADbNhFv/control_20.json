My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation involves a mom who hasn't worked in 40 years, relies on her husband's income, and is described as being negative, critical, and uninterested in her children's lives. The author, now an adult, visits once a year and responds to their mother's behavior by being dismissive and showing disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014constant complaints, lack of support, and being a negative presence. The author's treatment of the mother is extreme: not speaking, avoiding her, showing open disdain. The key question is whether the author's response is justified given the mother's actions.\n\nFamily relationships are complex. Respect is generally expected, even in difficult situations. However, the mother's actions have been ongoing for decades, and the author has suffered from this negativity. The author might feel justified in distancing themselves, especially since the mother hasn't shown interest in their lives and is critical. But the author's approach is disrespectful, which might not be the healthiest or most constructive response.\n\nHowever, the mother's behavior is also toxic. The author is an adult and can make their own choices about how to interact. The problem is that the author is choosing to show no respect, which might go against cultural or familial expectations. But given the mother's behavior, some might argue the author is justified in setting boundaries.\n\nI need to weigh the mother's faults against the author's response. The mother's lack of support and negative attitude is definitely a major issue. The author's actions, while disrespectful, could be seen as a reaction to years of mistreatment. However, treating someone with zero respect is still not a good solution. It doesn't address the underlying issues and might cause further damage.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is acting out of resentment, but the way they're expressing it is harmful. The mother is in the wrong for her behavior, but the author's response is also problematic. The correct answer might be that the author is in the wrong for their disrespectful treatment, even if the mother is at fault. The question is whether the author's actions make them wrong regardless of the mother's behavior.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because, while the mother is difficult, the author's response is not respectful, which is part of the problem. However, some might argue B because the mother's behavior is the root cause. But the question is about the author's actions. Even if justified by past experiences, treating someone with zero respect is wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
