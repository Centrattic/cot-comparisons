My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a mother who hasn't worked for 40 years, relies on the father's income, is critical, and the author treats her with disdain. The author's response is to be disrespectful, avoid her, and show clear dislike during visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior is problematic\u2014being unemployed, complaining, not engaging with her kids' lives, and being negative. The father is the sole provider, which could lead to an imbalance in the marriage. The author finds this toxic and is reacting negatively.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions are disrespectful: barely speaking, leaving the room, expressing hatred. Even if the mother is difficult, treating a parent with zero respect is generally frowned upon. Family relationships are complex, but cutting someone out completely, even if they're awful, might be seen as extreme. The author might be justified in feeling upset, but their response is not acceptable. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong). However, some might argue the mother's behavior is at fault. Still, the author's actions are not excusable. So, the answer is A.\n"
