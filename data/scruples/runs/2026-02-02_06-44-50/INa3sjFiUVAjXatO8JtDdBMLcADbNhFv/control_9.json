My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation involves the mother not working for 40 years, the father handling most household duties and finances, the mother's constant complaints about money and being a negative influence, and the author's response of ignoring her during visits and avoiding interaction.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points from the scenario. The mother hasn't worked since marrying the father, relies on the father's income, and has a negative attitude towards him, complaining about his salary. She's described as a \"petulant child\" and has no hobbies, focusing only on wealth and friends. The author feels alienated, with the mother not showing interest in their lives and criticizing achievements. The author's response is to avoid interaction, leading to a hostile visit.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms and family dynamics. In many cultures, respect towards parents is expected, but there's also a balance between respect and enabling toxic behavior. The mother's behavior might be seen as demanding or ungrateful, which can affect the family's well-being. The author's actions stem from frustration and a desire to protect their mental health. However, completely cutting off communication, even during visits, could be seen as disrespectful, regardless of the mother's actions.\n\nBut then, the author mentions that they're \"so sick of being around this negative life-sucking force,\" which indicates significant emotional toll. The question is whether the author's response is justified. Some might argue that ignoring someone during family gatherings is inconsiderate, especially if they're trying to improve their relationship. Others might empathize with the author's need to distance themselves from a toxic environment.\n\nHowever, the scenario doesn't mention any attempts by the author to address the mother's behavior or seek a resolution. It seems like the author has given up entirely, which could be seen as a lack of effort to maintain family ties, even if the mother's actions are problematic. There's also the aspect of the author's siblings, but the focus here is on the author's actions towards their mother.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the principle of reciprocity plays a role. If the mother isn't showing respect or interest, does that negate the author's responsibility to reciprocate? It's a tricky balance. The author might feel justified in their actions due to the mother's behavior, but completely cutting off communication might be seen as going too far, especially during family events which are supposed to be times of togetherness.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer could lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because while the mother's behavior is clearly problematic, the author's response of completely ignoring and avoiding their mother during visits might be seen as disrespectful and hurtful, even if it's a reaction to years of negative treatment. However, there's a counterargument that the author is justified in setting boundaries to protect their mental health. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might depend on cultural expectations and the idea that respect is owed regardless of the behavior. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
