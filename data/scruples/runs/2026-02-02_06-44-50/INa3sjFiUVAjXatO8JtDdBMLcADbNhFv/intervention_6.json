My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation involves a mom who hasn't worked in 40 years, is criticized by her daughter for not having a lavish lifestyle, and the daughter feels neglected and angry, leading to disrespectful behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother has been out of the workforce for a long time, which might have implications on her sense of self-worth or contributions to the family. However, the daughter feels that the mother is ungrateful, complaining about money despite the father's good income, and not showing interest in her kids' lives. The daughter's response is to treat her mother with disdain, avoid interaction, and openly express hatred during visits.\n\nOn one hand, disrespecting a family member, especially a parent, is generally frowned upon in many cultures. The daughter's actions could be seen as harmful and unkind. On the other hand, the mother's behavior over the years might have justified some resentment. The key here is whether the daughter's treatment is proportionate and if there's any room for empathy or understanding.\n\nThe daughter's perspective is that she's been enduring this for 20 years, and each visit is miserable. She feels that her mother's criticisms and lack of support are toxic. But the mother's actions, while clearly problematic, don't necessarily justify the daughter's extreme response. The daughter's behavior\u2014leaving the room, showing visible disdain\u2014could be seen as the wrong approach, even if the mother's behavior is inexcusable.\n\nI should also consider if there were any attempts at communication or resolution. The daughter seems to have given up on trying to connect, which might be part of the problem. However, the mother's lack of interest in her children's lives and constant negativity could contribute to that dynamic.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, while the mother's behavior is toxic, the daughter's response crosses into disrespect and neglect. The daughter might need to address her feelings differently, perhaps through setting boundaries or seeking therapy, rather than completely cutting off interaction in a disrespectful manner. The answer likely hinges on whether the daughter's actions are acceptable given the mother's behavior, but from a general standpoint, treating a family member with zero respect is typically considered wrong, regardless of the reasons.\n"
