My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The author is treating their mother with zero respect, avoiding her during visits, and showing open disdain. The mother is described as unemployable for 40 years, complaining about money, and not showing interest in the author's life. The author feels resentment and is acting out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. While the mother's behavior is problematic, does that justify the author's disrespectful treatment? Respect is important in family relationships. Even if someone is difficult, maintaining basic respect is usually considered necessary. The author's actions\u2014leaving the room when the mother enters, not engaging\u2014could be seen as disrespectful and harmful. Family dynamics can be complex, but cutting someone off completely might not be the healthiest approach.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's behavior is clearly toxic. She's manipulative, uninterested in her children, and uses her husband's success without contributing. The author's resentment is understandable. However, the question is about moral wrongdoing. While the mother is at fault, the author's response of total disrespect might be seen as their own wrongdoing. They could be harming the family relationship further and potentially causing emotional harm.\n\nBut then, maybe the author is within their rights to set boundaries. If the mother's behavior is toxic, the author might be protecting their own mental health. However, the way they're handling it\u2014complete avoidance and open disdain\u2014could be seen as disrespectful regardless of the mother's faults. The key is whether the author's response is proportionate. They might need to find a balance between setting boundaries and showing minimal respect.\n\nIn many cultures and ethical systems, even difficult family members deserve a certain level of respect. The author's actions could be seen as crossing that line. So, while the mother is definitely problematic, the author's complete lack of respect might be their fault. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But I also need to consider if there's a middle ground where the author is justified in their frustration but could still handle it differently. However, as per the question, we're to judge if the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on the balance between their justified anger and their disrespectful actions.\n"
