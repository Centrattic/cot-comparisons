My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. Hmm. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the mom hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying the dad. The dad handles most household duties and is the sole income provider. The mom complains about his salary and seems to be very materialistic, comparing herself to other women in the neighborhood. She's not interested in her kids' lives and is critical. The author, feeling resentful, distances themselves during visits, showing overt dislike. \n\nSo, the question is: is the author wrong? Well, respect is important in family relationships. Even if the mom's behavior is awful, cutting off communication entirely might be extreme. But on the other hand, the mom's behavior is pretty toxic. She's neglectful, critical, and self-centered. The author has valid reasons for feeling upset. However, treating someone with zero respect, even if they're a parent, isn't healthy. The author might be justified in their feelings but their response could be seen as disrespectful. Maybe there's a middle ground, like setting boundaries without being dismissive. But the way the author is acting\u2014leaving the room, showing disdain\u2014could be seen as wrong. But the mom isn't innocent here either. The answer might lean towards A (wrong) because the author isn't trying to maintain a respectful relationship, even if the mom is at fault. But maybe B (not wrong) because the mom's behavior is so bad that the author's response is understandable. It's a tough call. I think the key is whether the author's actions are proportionate. Disrespecting a parent is generally frowned upon, regardless of their behavior. So maybe A is the right answer.\n"
