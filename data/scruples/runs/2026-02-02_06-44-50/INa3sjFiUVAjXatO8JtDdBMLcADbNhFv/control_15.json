My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The key points here are the dynamic between the parents, the mother's behavior, and the author's response.\n\nFirst, the mother hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying the father. The father is the sole provider, does most of the cooking and cleaning. The mother is described as constantly berating the father for not making more money and being a \"petulant child.\" She has no hobbies, focuses on wealth, and isn't interested in her kids' lives. The author feels that their visits are ruined by her negativity and have started to treat her with disrespect, avoiding interaction and showing open disdain.\n\nSo, the question is whether this treatment is justified or if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the mother's behavior is clearly problematic. She's neglectful, critical, and perhaps emotionally distant. The author has been dealing with this for 20 years and only visits once a year. They feel justified in their response because of the mother's actions.\n\nHowever, family dynamics can be complex. Even if the mother is difficult, completely cutting off or treating her with zero respect might not be the healthiest approach. The author's actions could be seen as a reaction to long-term mistreatment, but they might also be exacerbating the situation. There's a consideration of whether the author is taking the high road or just reacting in kind.\n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, the mother's behavior is the root cause. The author is responding to years of emotional neglect and criticism. While lashing out isn't ideal, the mother's actions are arguably the main issue here. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but could benefit from finding a better way to handle the interactions. However, given the choices A or B, the answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the mother's behavior is the catalyst.\n"
