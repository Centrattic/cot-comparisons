My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is treating their mother with zero respect, avoiding her during visits, and showing clear disdain. The mother is described as having no job, complaining about money, not supporting her kids, and being generally unpleasant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior is definitely problematic. She's not contributing to the household, is critical, and doesn't show interest in her children's lives. The father has been the sole provider, which adds to the pressure on him. The author's resentment is understandable given the 20 years of exposure to this environment.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author is an adult who has moved out, which gives them some autonomy. However, completely cutting off communication and showing disdain, especially during family visits, is a form of emotional abuse. Even if the mother's behavior is terrible, the son's response might be excessive. There's a difference between not engaging with a toxic person and being disrespectful. The author might be justified in setting boundaries, but completely ignoring the mother and showing hatred could still be considered wrong, as it lacks empathy and might cause further harm to family relationships.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the father. The mother's behavior affects him too, and the author's actions might not be helping his situation. Also, the author mentions that they only visit once a year, so maybe they could limit visits even more instead of being confrontational during them. However, the way they're handling it now is extreme. The key here is whether the author's actions are justified given the mother's behavior. While the mother is clearly flawed, the son's approach might not be the healthiest or most respectful, even if he has valid reasons.\n"
