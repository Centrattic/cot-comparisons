My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a person treating their mother with zero respect. The mother is described as not working, relying on the father for income, being critical, and not showing interest in her children's lives. The author, who moved out at 20, now avoids their mother during visits, showing disdain and even avoiding her presence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior sounds toxic and possibly neglectful. She's not contributing to the household, is always negative, and doesn't support her children. The author's response is to shut down communication and show open disdain. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the mother's actions are problematic, and the author has a right to set boundaries. But on the other hand, treating someone with zero respect, especially a parent, can be seen as wrong regardless of the reasons. The author is actively avoiding the mother, not engaging, which might be a form of emotional abuse or neglect in return. \n\nI should consider cultural factors too. In some cultures, respect for parents is paramount, regardless of the parent's behavior. But in others, setting boundaries is more acceptable. The author's actions might be justified as self-preservation, but does that make it right? Also, the author is in their 20s, possibly an adult, so they have autonomy. However, completely cutting off a parent might not be the healthiest approach, but it's understandable given the mother's behavior.\n\nThe key points here are the mother's toxic behavior versus the author's disrespectful response. While the mother is clearly at fault, the author's actions might be a reaction to that. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Even if the mother is bad, treating someone with zero respect isn't right. The author might be justified in their feelings, but their actions are disrespectful, so they could be in the wrong. Alternatively, if the mother is so toxic, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for protecting their mental health. It's a bit of a balance between the two.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because regardless of the mother's faults, treating a parent with zero respect isn't acceptable. However, there's a nuance here. The answer could be A (yes, in the wrong) because the author's actions are disrespectful, but some might argue B (not in the wrong) due to the mother's behavior. But traditionally, in these kinds of questions, the assumption is that respect is required even if someone is unpleasant. So maybe A is the right answer here.\n"
