My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation is pretty intense. The author's mom has been unemployed for 40 years, relying on the dad for income. The dad does most of the work, and the mom is described as complaining about money, not interested in the kids' lives, and acting petulantly.\n\nThe author moved out at 20, visits only once a year, and during visits, they avoid interaction, leave the room when the mom enters, and show open disdain. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mom's behavior sounds toxic and emotionally abusive. She's not supportive, only critical, and focused on material things. The author's resentment is understandable given the treatment. But the author's response is cutting off communication completely, which is extreme. \n\nHowever, the author mentions they tried to put up with it for 20 years. Maybe they've reached a breaking point. But treating someone with zero respect, especially a family member, can be problematic. Even if the mom is difficult, the author's reaction might be seen as disrespectful. But also, setting boundaries is important for mental health. \n\nIn some cultures, filial piety is expected, but others value individual well-being. The author's actions might be seen as justified self-defense against emotional toxicity. On the other hand, completely disengaging might not be the healthiest approach. \n\nI should balance these factors. The mom is at fault for her behavior, but the author's response is also extreme. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the context, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), because the mom's actions are the root cause. But some might argue that respect is expected regardless. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn similar situations, people often struggle with balancing respect for family and their own mental health. The author's actions are a form of self-preservation. While not ideal, it's not entirely their fault. So leaning towards B.\n"
