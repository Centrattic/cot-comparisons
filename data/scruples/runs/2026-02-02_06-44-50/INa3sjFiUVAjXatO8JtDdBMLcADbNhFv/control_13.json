My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The story is about someone treating their mom with zero respect. They say their mom hasn't worked in 40 years, their dad does most of the work and provides all the income. The mom is critical of the dad's salary and complains about their lifestyle. She's described as acting like a petulant child, has no hobbies, and isn't interested in the kids' lives.\n\nThe author is so fed up that they avoid their mom during visits, leave the room when she enters, and don't hide their dislike. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the mom's behavior sounds toxic and selfish. Not having a job for 40 years and being uninvolved in her children's lives might be a red flag. The dad is the sole provider, which could create an imbalance. The mom's criticism and lack of support could contribute to the author's resentment.\n\nOn the other hand, treating a parent with zero respect and avoiding them entirely might be seen as disrespectful. Even if the parent isn't perfect, the author's actions could be harmful. The author's behavior might escalate tension, make the mom feel unloved, and set a bad example if they have their own children. There might be cultural or familial expectations about respecting parents regardless of their actions.\n\nBut the author's experiences are valid. Being neglected and criticized can lead to emotional distress. The author might feel justified in their actions because of the mom's behavior. However, the way they're handling it could be counterproductive. Maybe a better approach would be to set boundaries without being completely dismissive, or to communicate their feelings in a healthier way.\n\nThe key question is whether the author's actions are a reasonable response. While the mom isn't perfect, the author's complete lack of respect might be excessive. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. In many cultures, respect for parents is expected, even if the parents aren't ideal. So the author might be in the wrong for their treatment, even if the mom's behavior is problematic.\n"
