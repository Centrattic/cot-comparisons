My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a person who treats their mother with zero respect because of her behavior. The mother is described as not working, complaining about money, and not showing interest in the writer's life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is disrespectful, avoids interaction, leaves the room when their mother enters, and openly shows disdain. The mother's behavior is problematic too, being self-centered and critical. But the question is about who is in the wrong.\n\nI know that in most ethical frameworks, treating someone with disrespect is generally wrong, even if the other person has flaws. But there's also the aspect of family dynamics and emotional harm. The mother's behavior might contribute to the author's feelings, but that doesn't justify the author's actions. However, some might argue that the mother's actions are the root cause.\n\nI need to decide if the author's response is justified. While the mother's behavior is certainly hurtful, the author's approach of complete disengagement and showing hatred is extreme. It's possible that the author should seek better ways to handle the situation, like setting boundaries without being disrespectful. But is the author in the wrong? If we follow the principle of treating others with respect regardless of their actions, then yes. But if we consider the context and the mother's role in creating the conflict, maybe there's a balance.\n\nHowever, the question is specifically about the author's actions. Even if the mother is at fault, the author's disrespectful behavior is still wrong. So the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But I should check if there's any nuance I'm missing. The author was put in a difficult situation for 20 years, which might affect their judgment. Still, the choice to treat someone with zero respect is a personal decision. The mother's behavior is bad, but it doesn't make the author right for responding that way. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
