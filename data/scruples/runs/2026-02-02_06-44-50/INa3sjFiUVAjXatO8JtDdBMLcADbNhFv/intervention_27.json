My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author treating their mother with zero respect. They describe their mom as not having a job for 40 years, relying solely on their dad's income, being critical of him, and not showing interest in the author's life. The author responds by being distant and avoiding interaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior sounds toxic\u2014lacking hobbies, complaining about money, and not supporting her children. The father is the sole provider, which might add to the stress. The author, after years of this, is now cutting their mother off during visits. But is that justified?\n\nRespect in family relationships is important, even if the other person isn't respectful. The author's actions\u2014leaving the room, not engaging\u2014could be seen as disrespectful, regardless of the mother's behavior. However, the mother's actions might have contributed to the author's feelings. The key is whether the author's response is appropriate.\n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. Even if the mother is difficult, responding with total disregard might not be the healthiest approach. However, the author mentions being \"so sick of it\" and not hiding their disdain. From an ethical standpoint, while the mother has flaws, the author's actions might be considered unkind or disrespectful, hence them being in the wrong. But some might argue that after years of neglect and negativity, the author's reaction is a form of self-preservation. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which often relates to social norms. Treating a parent with zero respect is generally frowned upon, regardless of circumstances. So the answer might be A.\n"
