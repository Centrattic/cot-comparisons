My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The author is treating their mother with zero respect, avoiding interaction, and showing open disdain during visits. The mother is described as having a poor work ethic, being critical of her husband's income, and emotionally distant towards her children. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother hasn't worked for 40 years, relies on the father's income, and is portrayed as negative and self-centered. The author has had to endure this for years and is now responding by cutting off communication. But is that justified?\n\nFrom a family perspective, respect and communication are important. Even if the mother's behavior is problematic, the author's response of complete disengagement and disdain could be seen as harmful. However, the mother's behavior is also toxic, and the author is in a vulnerable position, having moved out and trying to distance themselves. \n\nThere's a balance between standing up for oneself and maintaining a relationship. The author might feel justified due to years of neglect and negativity, but cutting off all communication without attempts to address issues could be seen as extreme. However, the mother's actions likely contributed to the author's feelings. \n\nI need to consider if the author's actions are proportionate. The mother's behavior is clearly negative, but the author's response might be seen as valid self-preservation. However, treating a parent with zero respect is generally frowned upon, regardless of the parent's faults. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's own emotional well-being. If the visits are causing significant distress, it's reasonable to set boundaries. But the method\u2014complete disengagement and disdain\u2014might be too harsh. Perhaps there's a middle ground, but given the scenario, the author's actions are a reaction to a toxic environment. \n\nIn conclusion, while the mother's behavior is problematic, the author's response of complete disrespect might not be entirely justified. However, the mother's actions have contributed to the situation. But in terms of right and wrong, the author's actions could be seen as a last resort after years of mistreatment. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the options, I might lean towards A (they're in the wrong) because of the complete lack of respect, but the context complicates it. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if considering self-defense from a toxic parent.\n"
