My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the author's mother hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying their dad. The dad is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mom is described as complaining about money, acting petulantly, and not being interested in the author's life. The author feels resentment and now treats their mom with disdain during visits, even avoiding interaction.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (Yes, wrong) or B (No, not wrong).\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The mother's behavior is clearly problematic. She's not contributing to the household, is critical, and shows little interest in her children's lives. But does that justify the author's disrespectful treatment?\n\nFrom a traditional standpoint, respect for parents is often emphasized. Even if they're flawed, cutting them off entirely and showing disdain might be seen as wrong. However, the author's mental health is a factor. They're under a lot of stress from these visits, which are infrequent but draining. The mother's behavior is toxic, so maybe the author's actions are a form of self-preservation.\n\nBut is there a middle ground? Like setting boundaries without complete disrespect? The author's approach is extreme\u2014leaving the room, not speaking, showing open disdain. That could be hurtful. But considering the mother's behavior, maybe the author feels justified. However, the author's actions might perpetuate a cycle of toxicity. Maybe they could have addressed the issues more constructively, like having a talk or limiting visits.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's actions over 40 years have contributed to this resentment. The author might not have had the opportunity to address this earlier, leading to a buildup that's hard to handle. The fact that the author is across the country and only visits once a year might mean they can't avoid their mom entirely. But treating her with zero respect could harm the relationship further.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, there's a balance between self-respect and respect for others. The author's frustration is valid, but their approach is disrespectful. However, given the mother's behavior, perhaps it's understandable. But the answer depends on the cultural or moral perspective. Some might say the author is wrong because disrespects family, others might see it as justified self-defense against toxicity.\n\nGiven all that, I think the author is in the wrong. Even if the mother is difficult, treating her with zero respect isn't the solution. There are other ways to handle it. So the answer is A.\n"
