I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy Christmas gifts for family members using the $400 gift card they won.\n\nFirst, the author got a gift card and didn't want their mom to know. But their sister found out through Instagram, and the mom ended up getting involved. The author agreed to buy gifts for mom and sister, but then the mom added two cousins. The author felt pressured and ended up not buying the gifts, using the money for themselves instead.\n\nSo, the main points here are about personal financial decisions and family expectations. The author is 15, which is a minor, but they have their own money here (the gift card they won). The parents might feel it's their responsibility to manage the child's money, but the author sees it as their own. \n\nThe author's mom might have overstepped by adding more people without asking, leading to the author feeling forced and resentful. The author's decision to use the money for themselves could be seen as a reaction to that pressure. However, not buying gifts for family members, especially close ones like parents and siblings, might be considered inconsiderate, depending on cultural or family norms. \n\nBut since the author is a teenager, there's an argument that they're learning about financial independence and may have a right to manage their own money. The parents, on the other hand, might expect a certain behavior, especially around family traditions. The key factors here are the author's right to their own money versus family expectations. \n\nThe author did agree initially but changed their mind after more demands. The mom's approach might be seen as pushy, which justifies the author's frustration. However, not fulfilling a promise (even if it was coerced) could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the situation involved pressure and a lack of prior agreement. The parents' demands were excessive, especially for cousins the author doesn't see often. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
