I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 15-year-old who won a $400 gift card, and then family members kept pressuring them to buy gifts for multiple relatives. The kid initially agreed but then changed their mind, spent the money on themselves and a friend, and got in a fight with their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a teenager who might not have a lot of financial independence. Winning a gift card is a windfall, and the family's reaction seems to be about using it for gifts. The key points here are the pressure from family, the author's financial conservatism, and the resulting conflict.\n\nThe mom and sister found out about the gift card, and the mom added more people to the list after the initial agreement. The author felt it was too much, especially for cousins they don't see often. They decided to keep the money, which led to a confrontation.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit nuanced. On one hand, the author was given no choice but to spend the money as directed by their mom, which can feel like a violation of their autonomy. The pressure and the mom's tone (\"be thoughtful, don't just get something cheap\") might have been overwhelming. The cousins are young, and maybe the mom thought they deserved something, but the author didn't feel the need to spend on them.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should have considered family expectations, especially around Christmas. However, the author did mention that they are very conservative with money, which adds another layer. They might have felt that the family was being greedy or taking advantage of their unexpected gift.\n\nThe age of the author also plays a role. At 15, they're still under the care of their parents, which might lead some to expect them to follow family traditions or contribute to gifts. But the way the family members reacted\u2014especially the mom's obnoxious demands\u2014could justify the author's frustration.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't legally obligated to buy gifts for family members, even if they received a gift card. The pressure from the family to use it for their benefit might have crossed a line. The author's decision to spend the money on themselves and a friend isn't inherently wrong, especially if they felt the family was being inconsiderate of their financial preferences.\n\nHowever, the way the author handled it\u2014hanging up on the mom and then getting into an argument\u2014might be seen as disrespectful. But given the context of the pressure and the mom's behavior, it's understandable. The mom also might have overstepped by not respecting the author's boundaries.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong. The main issue was the family's pressure and the author's right to manage their own money, even if it's a gift card. The author's age and financial situation add to the complexity, but their actions seem justified given the circumstances.\n"
