I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author, who's 15 years old, getting a $400 gift card. They didn't buy anything for their family members because their mom and sister kept adding more people to the list, which they found obnoxious. The author used the money for themselves instead and got into an argument with their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's age. At 15, they might still be learning about social norms and financial responsibility. However, Christmas is a time when many families exchange gifts, so there's an expectation. The author did agree to buy gifts for their mom and sister initially but then changed their mind when more demands came in. The mom might see this as breaking a promise, but the author felt pressured and perhaps overwhelmed.\n\nThe author's mom asked for gifts for cousins too, which the author found unreasonable given the distance in their relationship. The author might feel that their money is their own, especially since it was a gift card they won. However, in many families, especially with children, there's an expectation to share such windfalls, even if not legally obligated.\n\nThe argument about greed and keeping assets private is a bit complex. The author might be justified in feeling pressured, but the way they handled it\u2014ignoring calls and then arguing\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. The mom's reaction is also typical of a parent feeling slighted, but the author's explanation might make people sympathize with their frustration.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while not everyone is expected to buy gifts, the author didn't communicate their decision clearly. They could have explained their limits earlier instead of letting it escalate. However, the initial pressure from the family might have made the author feel cornered. \n\nThe key points are the age, the sudden pressure, and the communication breakdown. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but they could have handled it better. The answer is a bit nuanced, but given the context, the author might not be in the wrong. So, the answer is B.\n"
