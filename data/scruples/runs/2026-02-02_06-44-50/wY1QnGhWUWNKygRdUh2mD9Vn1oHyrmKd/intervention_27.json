I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is 15 years old and got a $400 Target gift card. They posted about it on Instagram, which their sister saw. The sister called to ask about it, and the author told her not to tell their mom. But then their mom found out anyway and said they had to get something for the author's sister and the mom. Then the mom called again, adding two cousins (ages 6 and 2) to the list. The author refused and spent the money on themselves instead. Their mom got upset and there was an argument.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but wants my opinion. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author got a gift card they didn't plan to share. They tried to keep it secret but failed. The mom then insisted on using the gift card for other family members. The author felt pressured and decided not to buy gifts for anyone else, leading to conflict.\n\nIs the author wrong for not buying gifts? Well, they used their own money (the gift card was a personal prize). The mom and sister seemed to take advantage by expecting gifts after finding out about the gift card. The author's decision to spend it on themselves might be seen as standing up for their privacy and financial autonomy, especially since the gift card was a personal win. However, in some family traditions, expecting gifts for close relatives might be standard. But the author was pressured after the mom found out, which might justify their frustration.\n\nThe author is 15, so maturity level could be a factor. But the mom's actions of pressuring and trying to control the gift card might be the bigger issue here. The author's response, while perhaps rude, might be a reaction to being taken advantage of. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong entirely. However, the initial refusal to buy gifts might be seen as selfish, especially if they had intended to buy gifts before the mom's interference. But the story says that the mom's demands made them change their mind. So the mother's behavior might be the root problem.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But the author might not be entirely at fault. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong). But maybe some would say they should have handled it differently. Hmm.\n"
