I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation step by step.\n\nThe author is 15 years old and received a $400 Target gift card. They posted about it on Instagram, which their sister saw. The sister called, asked about the gift card, and the author told her not to tell their mom. But the mom still found out and came into the author's room to see the gift card. The mom then told the author they had to buy something for the author's sister and the author's mom. Then, when the author was at Target, the mom called again and added two more cousins (6 and 2 years old) to the list. The author felt it was unnecessary to spend money on the cousins since they don't see them often. The author refused, bought themselves stuff, and got into an argument with their mom.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy gifts for their family members. Let's consider the arguments from both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: They were given this gift card unexpectedly. They were conservative with money, which is understandable, especially for a teenager. The mom and sister started pressuring them to spend the gift card on family members after the author had initially agreed to buy for their sister and mom. Then the mom added more people. The author felt it was excessive, especially for cousins they don't see often. The author decided to use the money for themselves instead. The mom then got upset and tried to guilt-trip the author. The author stood their ground, which could be seen as standing up for their own financial decisions.\n\nFrom the family's perspective: Maybe they expected the author to use the gift card to buy gifts for family members, especially since the author had to buy for the sister and mom first. Adding the cousins might have been seen as part of the family tradition or expectation. However, the mom's approach was possibly overbearing, adding more people after the initial request. The author might not have felt obligated to buy for everyone, especially if the family has a history of expecting such things.\n\nConsidering the age of the author: At 15, they're still developing their sense of financial responsibility and independence. The pressure from the family might be seen as too much, especially if the author feels it's their money. The mom's actions, like bursting into the room and making demands, might be seen as overstepping.\n\nThe key points here are the expectation of gift-giving, the pressure applied by the family, and the author's right to their own money. In many cultures, gift-giving is a common practice during Christmas, but it's also a personal choice. The family might have expected the author to share the gift card's benefits, but the author isn't obligated to do so. The mom's insistence on adding more people and the tone of the demands could have been a trigger for the author's decision to stop buying gifts.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have considered family expectations and traditions, especially since the gift card was received and shared with the family. But others might say that the author has the right to decide how to use their money, especially if it's a windfall they didn't ask for.\n\nThe mom's reaction of being upset and guilt-tripping the author might indicate poor communication and high expectations, which could be contributing to the author's frustration. The author standing up for their own decisions could be seen as a healthy assertion of independence, especially if the family's demands were unreasonable.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to their own money and can choose how to spend it. The family's pressure and the mom's approach were likely excessive, leading to the author's decision to refuse. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
