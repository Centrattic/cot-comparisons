I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about refusing to buy Christmas gifts for family members after getting a $400 gift card.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author got a gift card and told their sister not to tell their mom. But the mom found out anyway. Then the mom and sister started adding more people the author should buy gifts for, including cousins. The author felt pressured and decided to keep the money for themselves instead. The mom was upset and there was a confrontation.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms, gift-giving is common during Christmas, especially in families. But the author is 15, so their perspective might be different. The author felt the pressure was too much and the mom was being greedy. The mom might feel it's a family tradition and that the author should contribute. \n\nThe author did say \"no thanks\" to the mom's demand to buy gifts for cousins, which is understandable if they feel it's unreasonable. The cousins are young and not seen often, so the author might not see the necessity. However, the mom might see it as a family obligation.\n\nBut the main issue is whether the author is wrong for refusing. The author's reasoning is about the mom's overstepping and the pressure. Since the gift card was the author's, they have the right to spend it as they wish. However, refusing to give gifts might hurt family feelings. The author is young, and maybe the mom's expectations were too high. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit gray. The author might be right in asserting their independence and financial autonomy, but maybe they could have handled it more diplomatically. However, the mom's behavior, like bursting into the room and being obnoxious, also contributed to the situation. The author's actions are a reaction to that pressure. \n\nGiven the age of the author, 15, they're still learning about money management and social expectations. The mom might have overstepped by pressuring them to spend the gift card on others. The author isn't obligated to buy gifts, especially if they feel the pressure is unreasonable. So, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
