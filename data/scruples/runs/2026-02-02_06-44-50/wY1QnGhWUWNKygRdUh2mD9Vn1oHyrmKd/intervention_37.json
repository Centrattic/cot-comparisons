I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about refusing to buy family members Christmas gifts after winning a $400 gift card. \n\nFirst, the author got a gift card and bragged about it on Instagram. Their sister saw it, called to ask who gave it, and the author told her not to tell their mom. But the mom found out anyway, took the gift card, and started pressuring the author to buy gifts for family members. The author then decided not to spend the money on family and bought themselves stuff instead. The mom was upset, and there was an argument.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the context. The author is 15 years old, which is a teenager. They have a history of being conservative with money. The problem here is the pressure from family to spend the gift card on others, which the author didn't do. The author felt that the family was being greedy and overstepping by demanding gifts for multiple people, including cousins they don't see often. The author's response was to spend the money on themselves instead.\n\nNow, the question is whether this makes the author wrong. On one hand, family expectations might be that if you receive money, you share with others. On the other hand, the family members pressured the author, broke their trust by not keeping the gift card secret, and the author was young and perhaps not in a position to spend on others. The author's actions could be seen as standing up for their own financial boundaries, especially after being pushed by family.\n\nBut then again, some might argue that since they had the money, they should have shared, especially with family. However, the key points here are the pressure the author faced, the breach of trust when the mom found out, and the author's age. At 15, they might not have the same financial responsibility as an adult. Plus, the mom did approach the author after the initial agreement, adding more people to the list, which might have been unreasonable.\n\nSo, the author's refusal could be seen as justified given the circumstances. They were pressured, their privacy was invaded, and they decided to use the money as they saw fit. Therefore, the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
