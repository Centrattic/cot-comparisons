I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy gifts for family members after getting a $400 gift card. The author is 15, which is a teenager, so maybe that's a factor.\n\nFirst, the author won a gift card and told their sister, who then told their mom. The mom then pressured the author to buy gifts for the sister, cousins, etc. The author felt it was unfair that the mom added more people after the initial request. The cousins are young, so maybe the author thought it wasn't necessary to spend much on them. The author then decided to use the money for themselves and a friend, leading to a conflict with the mom.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the author is a minor, 15 years old. In some contexts, minors might be expected to have family expectations, but they also have their own judgment. The mom might feel that as part of the family, sharing gifts is customary. However, the author was given the gift card, which is their own money, and they didn't feel obligated to share. The mom and sister overstepped by pressuring them without considering their perspective. The author's reaction was to stand their ground, which could be seen as justified if they felt the pressure was excessive.\n\nOn the other hand, in some family traditions, buying gifts for relatives is a norm, especially during Christmas. The author's refusal might be seen as selfish or disrespectful. But considering the mom kept adding more people and being \"obnoxious,\" the author might have a valid point about the pressure. The age factor is important here. At 15, they might not have a lot of financial stability and have their own priorities.\n\nSo, the answer could hinge on whether the pressure from the family was unreasonable. The author's decision to use the money for personal items isn't inherently wrong, especially if it's their own money. The mom's behavior might be the issue here, expecting gifts and then being upset when the author didn't comply after the pressure. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
