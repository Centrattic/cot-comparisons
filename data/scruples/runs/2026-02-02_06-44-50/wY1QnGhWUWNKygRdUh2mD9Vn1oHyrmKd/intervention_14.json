I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about refusing to buy Christmas gifts for family members after receiving a gift card they won. The user is asking whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author got a $400 Target gift card, shared it on Instagram, and their sister saw it. The sister called, and the author told her not to tell their mom, but the mom found out anyway. Then the mom insisted the author use the gift card to buy gifts for the author's sister, two cousins, and maybe others. The author felt pressured and decided to spend the money on themselves instead, leading to a conflict with their mom.\n\nThe author is 15 years old, which is important. At that age, they might not have a lot of financial independence yet, and their perspective on money and family expectations could be different. The mom's behavior seems to be a big factor here. She didn't ask but rather ordered the author to buy gifts, which could be seen as pressuring them. The cousins are young (6 and 2), so maybe the mom felt they needed something, but the author didn't see the necessity, especially since they don't see them often.\n\nThe author's argument is that they were being greedy and obnoxious, so they decided to keep the money. The mom tried to guilt-trip them, but the author stood their ground. Now, the question is whether the author was wrong to refuse buying the gifts.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms. In some families, it's expected to give gifts to close family members, especially during Christmas. However, the author didn't receive the gift card as an allowance or inheritance; they won it. The author isn't obligated to share it unless the family made prior agreements. The mom's actions of checking the gift card and then demanding gifts without prior discussion might have crossed a line. The author was trying to protect their own money, especially since they are conservative with spending and it's their own money they won.\n\nBut then again, if the author had communicated their intention not to buy gifts from the start, maybe the situation could have been resolved better. However, given the mom's reaction and the pressure, the author felt justified in their actions. The key here is the lack of mutual understanding. The author didn't want to spend money they felt they had earned for themselves, and the mom expected it to be shared without discussing it first.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, they didn't follow their mom's expectations, which might be seen as disrespectful. On the other hand, they were defending their own money and felt pressured. Since the author is 15, their financial responsibility might not be fully developed yet. The mom's approach was probably too harsh, but the author could have handled it differently. Maybe by explaining their stance earlier instead of changing their mind after the fact.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions might be seen as selfish by some, the mom's behavior contributed to the conflict. However, refusing to buy gifts for family members after being pressured could be considered inconsiderate. So, maybe the author is somewhat in the wrong, but the situation is more complex. But according to the options given, I have to choose A (yes) or B (no). Considering the author's age and the mom's role, maybe the answer is B. But if the cultural expectation is strong on giving gifts, then A. Hmm.\n"
