I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is 15 years old and found a $400 Target gift card. They initially planned to buy gifts for their mom and sister but didn't expect the mom to add cousins to the list after getting the gift card. The mom's reaction and the pressure from the family members made the user feel resentful, leading them to spend the money on themselves instead.\n\nFirst, the user's actions: spending money they received on themselves when others expected gifts. At 15, they might not have a strong grasp of social norms around gift-giving. However, the situation involves family expectations. The mom did increase the list, which the user found unreasonable, especially for cousins they don't see often. The user felt pressured when their mom called during shopping and added more people, which led to resentment.\n\nThe user did communicate their refusal by hanging up, which might come off as abrupt. The mom might feel hurt because the user didn't follow through with initial plans. But the user's main argument is about the pressure and the mom's overreach. The user's age is a factor; they might be learning about financial independence and boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the user did initially plan to buy gifts and even told the sister not to tell the mom, which suggests they had some intention to participate. The mom's actions of suddenly adding cousins could be seen as pushing for more, but the user has the right to decide how to use their money. The user's frustration stems from feeling that their money was being \"taken\" by the mom's demands.\n\nIn terms of cultural context, gift-giving during Christmas is common, but there's no strict rule that requires it. The user's decision to prioritize their own needs after feeling pressured might be justified. However, the way they handled it\u2014hanging up and ignoring calls\u2014could be seen as disrespectful, even if they were upset. \n\nConsidering all angles, the user might not be entirely in the wrong. They felt pressured and responded by asserting their independence. The mom's behavior could also be at fault for the pressure. The user's age suggests they're still learning about these dynamics. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong), but with nuance.\n"
