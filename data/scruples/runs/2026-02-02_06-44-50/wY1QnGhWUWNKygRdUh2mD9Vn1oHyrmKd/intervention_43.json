I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The author is a 15-year-old who refused to buy family members Christmas gifts after receiving a $400 Target gift card. The situation started when the mother found out about the gift and added more people to the list, which frustrated the author. The author then spent the money on themselves instead and faced backlash from the mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a teenager, which means they might still be learning about family dynamics and social expectations. They mentioned being very conservative with money, which suggests they value financial responsibility. However, the mother and sister added pressure by demanding gifts for more relatives, which the author found obnoxious. The author then decided to use the money for personal items, leading to a conflict with the mother.\n\nFrom a family perspective, there's an expectation in many cultures to give gifts, especially during Christmas. The author's refusal might be seen as inconsiderate, especially since they had the means. But the mother's approach was also problematic\u2014adding last-minute demands without considering the author's financial boundaries. The author's reaction could be seen as standing up for their own financial autonomy, which is a valid point, especially if the mother overstepped.\n\nHowever, the author did initially agree to buy gifts for the mother and sister, then later changed their mind after the mother added cousins. This backtracking might be seen as inconsiderate. The key here is whether the author's decision was reasonable given the pressure applied. At 15, the author is still developing maturity, so their actions might be understandable in the context of wanting control over their money and being frustrated by the pressure.\n\nOn the other hand, refusing to give gifts entirely without communication could be seen as selfish. The author didn't explain their decision to the family, leading to conflict. They also used the money for personal items, which the family might view as prioritizing their own wants over family obligations.\n\nConsidering all factors, it's a balance between the author's right to manage their money and the family's expectations. The mother's behavior was inappropriate, but the author's refusal without proper communication might also be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author's age and the mother's overreach might tip the scale towards the author being in the right. The final answer might hinge on cultural norms and personal values, but given the circumstances, the author's decision to prioritize their own financial comfort and the mother's guilt-tripping could support the argument that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
