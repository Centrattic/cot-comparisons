I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy family members Christmas gifts. The situation involves the author winning a $400 Target gift card, which their sister saw on Instagram. The mother then insists the author use it to buy gifts for the sister and cousins, leading to the author spending the money on themselves instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 15 years old, which is a minor. The gift card was won by them, so they have a right to use it as they see fit. However, the mother's insistence on using it for family gifts might be seen as pressuring the child. The key points here are the mother's demands and the author's reaction. \n\nThe author mentions that the mother's initial request was for the sister and then escalated to cousins. The mother even made the author buy thoughtful gifts, not cheap ones, which could be seen as excessive. The author felt pressured and decided to spend the money on themselves instead. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, family expectations can vary. Some might argue that the author is in the right because the money was their windfall, and they have autonomy over it. Others might think that family traditions and expectations play a role, especially during holidays, and not contributing could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nThe age factor is important here. A 15-year-old is still under parental authority, so the mother's expectation to use the gift card for family gifts might be part of household rules. However, the mother's approach was pushy and possibly manipulative, which could justify the author's frustration. \n\nThe author did communicate their refusal during the call, so they aren't acting without notice. The mother's subsequent anger and guilt-tripping might indicate that the pressure was unwarranted. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions might be seen as selfish by some, the mother's handling of the situation could be at fault for being overbearing. The author's age also means they might not have full financial independence yet. However, the core issue is the mother's insistence on using the gift card for family gifts without considering the child's feelings. Therefore, the author might not be entirely in the wrong.\n"
