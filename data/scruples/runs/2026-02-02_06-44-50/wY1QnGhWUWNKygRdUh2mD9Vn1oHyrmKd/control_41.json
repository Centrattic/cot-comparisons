I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about refusing to buy Christmas gifts for family members after receiving a gift card. The author is 15 years old, so age might be a factor here.\n\nFirst, the author got a $400 Target gift card. They told their sister, who then called to check who gave it, and the author specifically told her sister not to tell their mom. But the mom found out anyway. She then insisted the author use the gift card to buy something for her and the sister. The author agreed but later, the mom added two cousins to the list. The author felt pressured and decided to keep the money for themselves instead. Then they got in an argument with their mom.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The mom found out about the gift card, which the author tried to keep private. The mom then started demanding gifts for multiple family members. The author felt it was excessive, especially for cousins they don't see often. They decided to use the money for themselves and a friend. The mom was upset and guilt-tripped them.\n\nLegally, the gift card is the author's money. They can spend it however they want. The mom didn't give them the gift card, so she can't demand they use it for family gifts. However, family dynamics can be more complex. Culturally, there's an expectation to share gifts, especially in some families. But the author is a teenager, still learning financial independence. \n\nThe mom's behavior seems overbearing. She didn't ask, she commanded, and then added more people without the author's consent. The author's reaction in standing up for their money is understandable. The mom's guilt-tripping and yelling might be part of the problem here. \n\nConsidering the age, at 15, the author is still developing their sense of autonomy. It's common for teens to push back against parental control, especially regarding their own money. The mom's approach might have been too aggressive, leading the author to feel cornered.\n\nSo, while the mom's expectations might be rooted in family traditions, the author isn't obligated to comply. The author's decision to prioritize their own spending isn't wrong, especially given the mom's overreach. The key points are the mom's demands and the author's right to manage their own money. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
