I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for refusing to buy gifts for their family. The situation is a bit nuanced, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author got a $400 gift card and posted about it on Instagram, which their sister saw. The sister called to ask about it, and the author told her not to tell their mom. But then the mom found out and insisted the author buy gifts for the sister and the author. The mom even added more people (the cousins) after the initial request. The author felt pressured, especially since the cousins are young and they don't see them often. They decided to keep the money for themselves and got gifts for friends and themselves, which led to conflict with the mom.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that the family was being greedy and overstepping by pressuring them to spend the money, especially given the age and frequency of contact with the cousins. The author is 15, which might affect expectations around responsibility and family dynamics.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another perspective. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, family traditions often involve gift-giving, and the author might have felt obligated, especially if they were the one who brought up the gift card. But on the other hand, the mom's behavior\u2014pressuring and adding more people\u2014could be seen as unreasonable. The author might have a point in setting boundaries, especially being young and conservative with money.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The key points are: the author was given the gift card, which they could choose to use as they wish. The mom's insistence and the added pressure might have been the root cause. The author's decision to keep the money might be seen as their right, but the way they handled it (ignoring calls and not following through) could be seen as rude or inconsiderate. However, considering the author's age and the mom's overreach, it's a balance between family expectations and personal boundaries.\n\nIn some views, the author might not be in the wrong because they're not obligated to share the gift card. However, in a family context, there's an unspoken expectation that might make the author's refusal seem selfish. But given the mom's behavior, the author's stance could be justified. So, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong, but maybe there's nuance. The answer is B (No), but maybe there's a middle ground. However, the question is a yes or no. I'll go with B.\n"
