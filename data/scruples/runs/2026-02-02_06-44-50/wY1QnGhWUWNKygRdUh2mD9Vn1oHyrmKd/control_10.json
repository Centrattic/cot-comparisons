I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy family members Christmas gifts. The context is that the author got a $400 gift card, told their sister, who then told their mom. The mom and sister started pressuring the author to buy gifts for them and other relatives. The author felt this was excessive and decided to use the money on themselves instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author is 15, which is a minor, and might be learning about money management. The gift card was won, so it's technically the author's to use as they see fit. However, the family members expected gifts, especially after the author mentioned the gift card. The mom's reaction might have been about expectations and family traditions.\n\nOn one hand, the author is being criticized for not giving gifts, which could be seen as rude in some cultures. Family might expect that when someone has unexpected money, they share a bit. On the other hand, the author was pressured into it, and the mom and sister might have overstepped by demanding gifts, especially for cousins they don't see often. The author's decision to prioritize their own needs and not be pressured could be seen as standing up for themselves.\n\nThe key points are the pressure from family, the age of the author, and the sudden expectation. The author's reasoning is that the family was greedy and obnoxious, leading to their change of heart. Since the author is young, their perspective on money and autonomy might be different. In many cases, people might argue that it's okay to spend the money on oneself, especially if there was no prior agreement to share. The mom's guilt-tripping and the sister's informing could be seen as contributing to the conflict.\n\nSo, considering the pressure and lack of prior expectations, the author might not be in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
