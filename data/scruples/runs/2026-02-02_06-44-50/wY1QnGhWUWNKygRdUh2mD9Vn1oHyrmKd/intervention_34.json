I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is 15 and won a $400 Target gift card. They shared it on Instagram, and their sister saw. The sister told the mom, who then insisted the user buy gifts for the sister and themselves. Then the mom added two cousins, who are young and not close. The user refused and spent the money on themselves, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, the user's argument is that they don't have to spend their money on family, especially since the mom and sister pushed for it after finding out about the gift card. They also mention the cousins are not close, so why spend on them. The user's mom is seen as greedy for pushing for more gifts.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might feel that when a family member gets something nice, it's customary to buy gifts for others, especially in a holiday context. The user's refusal could be seen as inconsiderate, even if they were pressured. However, the mom's reaction, adding more people after the initial request, might have been a factor in the user's decision.\n\nThe user is a teenager, which is a time when they might be developing their own views on money and independence. They might feel that their own money should be their choice, and the push from family felt like an invasion of their autonomy.\n\nBut culturally, gift-giving during Christmas often involves family, and expecting some reciprocity is common. However, the mom's approach\u2014insisting on gifts for cousins they don't see often\u2014could be seen as excessive. The user's frustration is understandable, especially with the pressure to spend on people they don't have a close relationship with.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? They did refuse to buy gifts, which might be seen as selfish. But they were pressured by their mom to spend on others, and then when they said no, it led to conflict. It's a bit of a gray area. The user's actions were within their rights financially, but socially, there's an expectation to participate in family traditions. However, the mom's overreach in adding cousins might justify the user's decision. Considering the age and the context, maybe the user isn't entirely in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
