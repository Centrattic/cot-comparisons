I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author receiving a gift card, sharing it on social media, then being pressured by family members to buy gifts for them, leading to the author refusing and spending the money on themselves instead. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is 15, which is a minor, but the question is about whether they did something wrong. The key points here are about the family's expectations versus the author's right to their own money. The gift card was won by the author, so they have the right to spend it as they wish. However, the pressure from family members might be a factor here.\n\nThe mother and sister found out about the gift card, and the mother started assigning gift purchases, even adding cousins. The author felt it was obnoxious and decided not to spend the money on gifts, instead buying themselves things. The mother was upset and argued with the author. \n\nThe main issue here is whether the author was wrong to refuse buying gifts for family members when the family pressured them. Family traditions and expectations vary, but the author's money should be their own to spend. However, there's a cultural aspect where giving gifts during Christmas is a common practice, and family members might expect it, especially if they are close. But in this case, the author is being pushed by the mother to buy gifts, which might be seen as taking advantage of the author's good fortune.\n\nThe author's decision to keep the money and not buy gifts could be seen as selfish, especially since they are part of a family that has these expectations. However, the mother's approach\u2014adding more people without considering the author's feelings or financial comfort\u2014could be the root problem. The author's response was to stop giving gifts altogether, which might be a reaction to the pressure rather than pure selfishness.\n\nConsidering the age of the author, at 15, they might not have a lot of financial independence yet. The mother's behavior in pressuring the author and not respecting their boundaries could contribute to the conflict. The author might be learning about financial independence, and this situation is a way to assert control over their own money.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did mention that they were very conservative with money, so spending $400 on themselves might be a lot, especially if they have limited income. But the money was a windfall, not earned income, so they have the right to spend it as they see fit. The family's expectations might not have been clear beforehand, so the author isn't necessarily obligated to buy gifts unless that was a mutual understanding.\n\nIn many cases, gift-giving is a personal choice, and while family traditions can be important, they shouldn't infringe on someone's right to use their own money. The mother's reaction could be seen as overstepping by pushing for more gifts after the initial pressure, especially for cousins the author doesn't see often. The author's refusal could be a justified stand against being taken advantage of.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong. They have the right to decide how to use their own money, and the family's pressure could have contributed to the situation. However, there's a balance between asserting personal financial autonomy and respecting family traditions. The author's actions led to conflict, but the responsibility isn't entirely on them, especially given the mother's role in pressuring them. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
