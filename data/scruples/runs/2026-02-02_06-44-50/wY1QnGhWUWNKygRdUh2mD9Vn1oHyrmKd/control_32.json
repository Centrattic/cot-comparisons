I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The story is about a 15-year-old who got a gift card, got pressured by family members to buy them gifts, and then refused, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teenager is very conservative with money, which is understandable. The mother and sister found out about the gift card and then started pressuring the teen to spend it on them. The mother even added more people (the cousins) without giving a valid reason. The cousins are young, so maybe the gifts could have been simple or inexpensive, but the mom insisted on being thoughtful and not cheap. That might have felt like an added pressure.\n\nThe teen decided not to spend the gift card on family members and instead bought themselves things and a friend. The mom was upset, leading to an argument. The teen felt that the family was being greedy and took their money, hence the refusal.\n\nNow, thinking about whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, refusing to buy gifts for family during Christmas could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if there's a cultural expectation of gift-giving. However, the pressure from the family members, particularly the mother, might have crossed a line. The teen is 15, so their responsibility to spend money on family isn't a legal requirement. The mother's actions of bursting into the room and pressuring the teen, plus adding more people without explanation, could be seen as overstepping. The teen's decision to prioritize their own spending, especially since the gift card was a windfall they didn't have to share, might be justified. \n\nBut some might argue that family expectations and traditions could play a role here. However, the way the family responded (being obnoxious and greedy) might have influenced the teen's reaction. The key points are the family's pressure and the teen's right to manage their own money. The answer might hinge on whether the pressure was unwarranted and the teen's autonomy in using their own money, even if it's a gift.\n"
