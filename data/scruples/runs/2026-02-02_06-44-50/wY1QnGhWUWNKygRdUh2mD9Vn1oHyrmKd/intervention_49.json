I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The story is about a 15-year-old who got a $400 Target gift card, and after some pressure from family, decided not to buy them gifts and instead spent the money on themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author initially told their sister about the gift card but asked her not to tell their mom. Then the mom found out, and started pressuring them to buy gifts for the mom, sister, and even two cousins. The author felt this was unfair, especially since the cousins are young and they don't see them often. They ended up spending the money on themselves, got into an argument with their mom, and now are being asked if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the main points are: family pressure to spend money, the author's financial decisions, and the resulting conflict. The age of the author is 15, which might affect how responsible they are expected to be. \n\nNow, considering cultural norms around gift-giving during Christmas. In many families, it's customary to give gifts to close family members. However, the author was under 18, so maybe their financial independence is more flexible. The mom did add more people (the cousins) after the initial request, which might have felt like excessive pressure. Also, the author explicitly said \"no thanks\" and followed through, which could be seen as a firm decision to prioritize their own desires.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of respect and family expectations. The mom might have expected some consideration, even if the author didn't have to spend a lot. The author's argument is that the family was greedy and overstepped by pressuring them. The author's spending on themselves could be seen as a reaction to that pressure, but maybe they should have communicated better or set boundaries earlier.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's actions\u2014bursting into the room, being obnoxious, adding more people without considering the author's feelings\u2014might have been unreasonable. At 15, the author might still be learning about money management and personal boundaries. If the mom hadn't been so pushy, the author might have been more willing to spend. But the author also had the right to decide how to use their own money, even if it's a gift.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on perspective. If the family expected gifts and the author didn't give any, maybe they should have communicated their decision earlier or at least informed the family. But if the pressure was undue, the author's decision to prioritize their own spending makes sense. The key factors are the family's pressure and the author's right to manage their own money. The mom's behavior was probably the main issue, but the author's refusal without clear communication might have exacerbated things. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they were pressured and used their own money. However, they might have handled it better by setting expectations upfront. But since they did explain their reasoning, maybe they're justified. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a cultural expectation that requires giving gifts regardless. In some contexts, not giving could be seen as rude, but given the family's behavior, the author's stance is understandable. So, probably B.\n"
