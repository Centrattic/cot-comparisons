I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 15-year-old who won a $400 Target gift card and then faced pressure from family members to buy them gifts. The kid initially agreed but changed his mind after the family kept adding more people and being pushy. He used the money for himself and a friend, leading to a conflict with his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The kid isn't obligated to spend his money on family gifts, especially if he's young and trying to manage his finances. The family might see sharing as part of the holiday spirit, but the pressure from parents and relatives could be a problem. The mother's reaction and the way the siblings handled the situation might have contributed to the kid's decision to back out. \n\nThe kid did warn his sister not to tell their mom, which shows he might have been trying to keep it secret. When his mom found out and added more people, he felt pressured. Using the money for himself isn't necessarily wrong, but the way he handled it\u2014hanging up and ignoring calls\u2014could be seen as rude. However, his age (15) might mean he's still learning about social expectations and boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, the family might feel it's normal to exchange gifts, especially during Christmas. The mother's guilt-tripping and the pushiness of adding cousins when he was already stressed could be the main issues. The kid's frustration is understandable if he felt forced to spend beyond his comfort level. \n\nI think the key points are the pressure from the family and the kid's right to manage his own money, even if it's under his parents' roof. While he could have handled the situation more gracefully, like explaining his decision calmly, he's a teenager learning. The family's expectations might be reasonable in their eyes, but the way they approached it was overbearing. \n\nSo, considering all that, I'd say the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's not obligated to spend his money as others want, especially when they were pushy. His age and the family's overreaction are factors here.\n"
