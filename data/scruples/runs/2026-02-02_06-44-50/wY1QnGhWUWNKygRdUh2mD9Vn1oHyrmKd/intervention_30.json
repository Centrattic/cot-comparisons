I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not buying family gifts after receiving a $400 gift card. \n\nFirst, the author got the gift card as a prize and initially planned to buy gifts for mom and sister. But when mom added cousins, the author refused and spent the money on themselves instead. The mom got upset, leading to an argument.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, they're 15, which is a teenager, and might be learning about money management. The mom expected them to share the gift, possibly thinking it's a family tradition or a way to teach generosity. The author felt pressured and violated when mom went through the gift card. The mom might have overstepped by adding more people and not respecting the initial agreement. \n\nBut, the author did agree to buy gifts for mom and sister first. Then the mom added cousins without the author's consent. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if they didn't want to spend on cousins they don't see much. However, not buying any gifts after agreeing might be seen as a breach of trust or expectation. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom's approach was pushy and maybe greedy, as the author felt. The key here is whether the author had an obligation to buy gifts. If the gift card was the author's to use as they wish, then they aren't wrong for choosing not to buy gifts. But if there was an implied family expectation, the author might be in the wrong for not following through.\n\nGiven the context, the author's actions were a response to the mom's pressure, so maybe the author isn't wrong. However, the initial agreement was to buy gifts for mom and sister, then mom added cousins, which the author felt was unreasonable. The author's decision to stop buying gifts after that might be justified based on the way they were treated. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
