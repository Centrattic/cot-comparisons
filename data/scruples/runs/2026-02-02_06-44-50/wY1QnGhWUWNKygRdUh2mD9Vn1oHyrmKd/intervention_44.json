I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who's 15, won a $400 Target gift card. They told their sister about it on Instagram, and then their mom found out and started pressuring them to buy gifts for the family. The author got annoyed because they felt the mom and family were being greedy, so they decided not to buy anything for the family and instead spent the money on themselves and a friend. The mom then got upset and there was an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the author. At 15, they might not have a lot of experience managing money or handling family expectations. They might not yet understand the social norms around gift-giving, especially in a family context. Gift-giving is often a cultural or family tradition, so maybe the author isn't fully aware of how important it is for their family.\n\nThe author mentions they are very conservative with money. So, they might feel that being asked to spend money on family members when they don't see them often (like the 6 and 2-year-old cousins) is unreasonable. They might feel that the family is taking advantage of their windfall without considering their financial habits or preferences.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's reaction could be seen as part of family expectations. In many families, there's an unspoken rule that when someone gets an unexpected amount of money, they might be expected to share or give gifts to family members. The mom's pressuring the author could be out of habit, not greed. However, the way she did it might have been pushy or not considerate of the author's wishes.\n\nThe author decided to use the money for themselves, which could be seen as self-centered, especially if they knew it was a family expectation. But they also might be standing up for their own values, like financial independence and not feeling obligated to spend as requested. The key here is whether there was an expectation versus a demand. If the mom was making it a requirement, the author has a right to decline. But if it was just a suggestion, the author's refusal might be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nAnother point is the author's age. At 15, they might not have the same perspective on financial responsibility and social etiquette as an adult. The situation might be more about them asserting their independence rather than being in the wrong. The fact that they felt pressured and then stood their ground could indicate they're learning to manage their own money and set boundaries.\n\nThe argument that followed might be a result of miscommunication. The author might not have clearly communicated their reasons for not wanting to spend the money on family, leading to the mom feeling slighted. However, the author's explanation about the cousins not being important to them and the family's overstepping might be valid points.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions might be a mix of financial conservatism, asserting independence, and reacting to pressure. Whether they're in the wrong depends on whether there was a legitimate expectation for gift-giving. If the family had no prior expectations, the author's decision is justified. If there was an unspoken rule, then maybe they are in the wrong. But given their age and the mom's pushy behavior, the author might be in the right for standing up for their own values. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author chose to use their money as they saw fit after being pressured, and they're still young, learning about these social dynamics.\n"
