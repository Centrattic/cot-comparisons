I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is 15 years old and refused to buy Christmas gifts for family members after receiving a $400 gift card. The main points here are about family expectations, personal financial control, and the situation's context.\n\nFirst, the author got a gift card and initially planned to buy gifts for mom and sister. But then the mom added cousins, which the author found unreasonable. The author felt pressured to spend on family they don't see often, leading to frustration. They decided to spend the money on themselves instead, which upset the mom.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on cultural norms and family dynamics. In many cultures, gift-giving is a tradition, and family might expect it. However, the author is a teenager with limited financial independence. The pressure from the mom to spend on extended family could be seen as excessive, especially when the author had already planned to buy gifts for immediate family. The mom's insistence might have been overstepping, given the author's age and the fact that the cousins are young and not frequently around.\n\nThe author's decision to prioritize their own spending after feeling pressured could be justified. They did buy a gift for a friend, showing they weren't being completely selfish. The mom's reaction might reflect her own expectations rather than the author's wrongdoing. The key here is the balance between family tradition and personal financial autonomy. Since the author is 15, they might not be expected to handle such responsibilities yet, especially with the added pressure from the mom. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were reacting to perceived greed and overstepping boundaries.\n"
