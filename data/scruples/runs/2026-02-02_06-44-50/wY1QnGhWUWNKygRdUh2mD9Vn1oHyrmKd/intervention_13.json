I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a 15-year-old who won a $400 gift card. He initially planned to buy gifts for his mom and sister but then his mom added two cousins, leading him to change his mind and spend the money on himself.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if the author is wrong. The author didn't give gifts to family members after his mom kept adding more people. The key points here are the context of the gift card, the mom's demands, and the author's response.\n\nThe author mentions he's very conservative with money. When his mom first asked for gifts for mom and sister, he agreed but then she added cousins. The cousins are young (6 and 2) and he doesn't see them often. He felt pressured and decided to stop buying gifts, which his mom didn't like.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to consider both sides. The author had the right to decide how to spend his own money, but maybe he could have handled the situation differently. However, the mom's actions\u2014like bursting into his room and adding more people\u2014might have been overbearing. The author's reaction was to stop giving gifts, which is a personal choice, but maybe he should have communicated better or set boundaries earlier.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might feel entitled to expect gifts from the child, especially since she was given the gift card. But the author isn't obligated to buy gifts for extended family unless it's a family tradition. The age of the author is also a factor; at 15, he's still learning about money and responsibilities. \n\nThe initial agreement was for mom and sister, but the mom expanded the list without asking. The author then changed his mind. The mom's guilt-tripping and yelling might be her fault, but the author's refusal to buy gifts after making initial plans could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nI think it's a bit of both. The author has the right to his money, but maybe he could have handled the situation with more communication. However, since he's a teenager and the mom kept adding people without considering his financial limits, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. But the fact that he changed his mind after agreeing and then spent the money on himself could mean he's in the wrong. But maybe not entirely. \n\nHmm, the answer is a bit tricky. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). Considering the mom's behavior and the author's right to his money, maybe B is the answer here. But if the author agreed to buy gifts and then backed out, that's his fault. But the mom's actions might have pushed him to that point. So it's a gray area. I think the author is partially wrong, but given the circumstances, maybe he's not entirely. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is. I'm leaning towards B because the mom's behavior was problematic, and the author has the right to his money. But some might argue he should have honored the initial agreement. I need to decide. The final answer is B.\n"
