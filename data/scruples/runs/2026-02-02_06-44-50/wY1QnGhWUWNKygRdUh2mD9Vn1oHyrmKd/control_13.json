I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user wants a simple A or B answer, but I need to think through the reasoning first.\n\nSo the situation is about a 15-year-old who won a $400 gift card. They told their sister on Instagram, and the sister called to ask about it. The author told her not to tell their mom, but the mom found out anyway. Then the mom and sister started pressuring the author to buy gifts for the whole family, including cousins. The author felt this was unreasonable, especially since the cousins are young and they don't see them often. They refused, bought themselves stuff instead, and their mom got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the family dynamics. The mom might have cultural or family expectations where giving gifts is important. But the author is a teenager with their own money. The gift card was won by the author, so it's their money to spend how they want. The mom's behavior of suddenly demanding gifts after the author didn't expect that (since they were saving for themselves) could be seen as taking advantage. \n\nThe author might feel that the family is being greedy, especially since they had to change their plans. The fact that the mom broke the author's trust by finding out without being told could be a key point. Also, the author is young and maybe doesn't have a high income, so spending $400 on multiple gifts might be a big financial burden. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom might believe that once family members know you have money, you should share. But the author didn't explicitly offer the money to the family, so maybe the pressure is unwelcome. The author's response of buying themselves stuff is a right, but the way they handled the conflict (hanging up, ignoring calls) might be seen as rude. However, the mom's guilt-tripping and yelling could be contributing to the problem.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily wrong. They have the right to their money and might feel pressured into giving when they don't want to. The mom's actions might be more at fault here. The author's age is a factor too; teenagers might not have the same expectations as adults. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
