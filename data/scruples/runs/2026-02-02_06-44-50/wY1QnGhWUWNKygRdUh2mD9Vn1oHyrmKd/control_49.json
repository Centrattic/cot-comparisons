I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy family members Christmas gifts after receiving a $400 Target gift card. \n\nFirst, the author got the gift card and initially didn't plan to share it with family. However, after his mother found out and pressured him to buy gifts for his sister, cousins, and himself, he decided not to spend the money on them and instead used it for personal items.\n\nHe's 15, which is a key point. At that age, financial independence and personal boundaries are developing. The mother's behavior seems to have escalated when she took the gift card without permission and added more people to the list. The author felt pressured and maybe even violated when his mom took the card and then kept adding to the list. \n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong for not buying gifts. On one hand, in many cultures, giving gifts to family is a common tradition, especially during Christmas. However, the mother's approach was quite demanding and perhaps overstepping. She didn't ask; she commanded, which could have justified the author's decision to stop.\n\nAlso, the author used the money for himself, which could be seen as selfish, but considering the pressure he faced, it's understandable. The mother's actions (taking the card, adding cousins without considering their age) might have been the root issue here. The cousins are 6 and 2, so it's debatable how necessary it is to spend on them. The author's decision to stop might be a reaction to the mother's greed, as he mentioned.\n\nBut, from another angle, the author did get the gift card and initially agreed to buy gifts, then changed his mind. That could be seen as flaky. However, the mother's behavior was probably the main problem. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is a positive thing. \n\nConsidering all factors, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. The mother's actions were more problematic, and the author's response was a defense of his autonomy, especially at his age. So answer B.\n"
