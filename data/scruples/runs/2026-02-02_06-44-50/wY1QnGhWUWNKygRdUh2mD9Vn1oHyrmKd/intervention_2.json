I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy family members Christmas gifts after receiving a $400 gift card. \n\nFirst, the author got the gift card and initially didn't plan to buy gifts for everyone. However, their sister found out and told the mom, leading to pressure from both. The author felt forced to buy gifts for mom, sister, and even cousins. Then they decided to use the money for themselves instead, leading to conflict.\n\nFrom a traditional perspective, family expectations around Christmas can be strong. In many cultures, giving gifts is a common practice, and the author's refusal might be seen as not participating in family traditions. However, the author is 15, and financial responsibility is still developing. They might not have a steady income, so spending $400 could be a big deal. Also, the mom and sister added pressure, which the author found obnoxious. The cousins are young, so maybe the author felt it was unnecessary to spend on them since they don't interact much.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did agree initially to buy gifts, then changed their mind. The mom tried to use the gift card money, which the author considered their own. The argument about privacy and controlling their own money is valid. The author might feel that their autonomy is being respected. However, the mom's reaction was a result of the author breaking the agreement, which could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nConsidering the age, the author is still a minor, and parents often manage finances to some extent. But the author's decision to prioritize their own needs after feeling pressured might be justified. The pressure from the family, especially the mom's \"obnoxious\" comments, could have pushed the author to act out. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author has a right to control their own money, but there's also social expectation to participate in family traditions. The initial agreement to buy gifts, then backing out, might be seen as a breach of trust. However, the family's pressure was excessive. \n\nSo, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. They had a valid reason to feel pressured and made a choice to protect their own interests. The mother's reaction was harsh, but the author's actions were a response to that. It's a mix of both sides. Since the author is 15, their perspective might be more about autonomy and less about understanding family expectations. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is standing up for their own financial decisions after being pressured.\n"
