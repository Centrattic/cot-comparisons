I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a 15-year-old who won a $400 gift card and then had family members, starting with his sister, find out. His mom then insisted he use the gift card to buy gifts for the family, which he refused and ended up spending on himself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was given a gift card through a drawing, which is a windfall. He didn't have to share it, but family expectations might come into play. However, the mom and sister started pressuring him after finding out. The initial agreement was that he wouldn't tell his mom, but the sister told anyway. The mom then added more demands, expecting gifts for cousins as well. The author felt this was excessive, especially since the cousins are young and not part of his regular life.\n\nThe author is 15, so his financial independence is probably limited. The gift card was his own, and he was being pressured by family to spend it on them. His response was to spend it on himself, which led to conflict with his mom. The question is whether he was wrong to refuse.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's about ownership and expectations. If the gift card was the author's money, he has the right to spend it as he wishes. However, family traditions might include gift-giving, so not participating could be seen as selfish. But the pressure from his mom and sister was aggressive, and the author felt it was unreasonable. The fact that the mom broke the trust by seeing the gift card and adding more demands might make the author's refusal understandable.\n\nThe key points are: 1) the author's right to control his own funds, 2) the family pressure tactics, 3) the reasonableness of the family's expectations, and 4) the author's age and financial situation. \n\nFrom a traditional standpoint, refusing to give gifts during Christmas might be frowned upon, but the family's behavior here is questionable. The author was pressured into sharing, then rebuked when he didn't. The mom's actions (breaking the trust of not telling her, adding more demands) could be seen as contributing to the author's anger. The author's decision to spend the money on himself, particularly when the family was being greedy and obnoxious, might be justified in his perspective. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer would lean towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because the family's approach was overbearing, and the author had the right to decide how to use his own money. However, there's a cultural aspect where gift-giving is expected, but the author's experience here shows that the family's expectations were unreasonable and possibly manipulative. So, the author's reaction is a reasonable boundary-setting, especially given his age and the circumstances.\n"
