I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. They provided a detailed scenario where the author, a 15-year-old, refused to buy Christmas gifts for family members after receiving a $400 gift card. The family members, especially the mom and sister, found out about the gift card and started pressuring the author to use it to buy gifts for them. The author then decided to keep the money for themselves and got gifts for a friend and themselves, leading to a conflict with the parents.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. The author is a minor, 15 years old, which is important because maturity levels can vary. The key points here are the initial pressure from the family after the author received the gift card. The mom and sister found out through social media and then the mother added more people to the list. The author felt it was their own money and didn't want to spend it on people they don't see often. \n\nNow, considering the author's perspective, they might feel that the money is their own and that the family members are being greedy or overstepping. However, in many families, there's an unspoken expectation to share gifts, especially during holidays. The author's decision to cut off the family members after the pressure might be seen as a reaction to being pushed, but refusing entirely without communication could be seen as abrupt. \n\nOn the other side, the family might feel that the author is being selfish or ungrateful, especially since they initially agreed to buy gifts. The author's response of \"keeping future assets private\" suggests a possible resentment towards family pressure, which is a valid feeling but might not be the best approach in a family setting.\n\nThe age factor is significant. At 15, the author is still developing financial independence and social skills. Their reaction could be a mix of immaturity and a desire to assert control over their own finances. However, refusing to buy any gifts, especially after initial agreement, might come off as inconsiderate. \n\nAnother angle is the initial pressure from the family. The mother added cousins to the list, which the author found unreasonable. The cousins are young and the author doesn't see them often, so spending on them isn't a priority. But the author's solution was to buy nothing for anyone, which might be too extreme. Maybe a compromise could have been better.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a grey area. The author has the right to their own money, but in a family context, there's an expectation of contributing. However, the family's pressure might have been excessive. The author's anger and cutting off communication could be seen as immature, but the situation does highlight the pressure from family members. \n\nOverall, I think the author is in the wrong because they reacted impulsively without considering communication or compromise. They could have explained their decision better rather than just cutting off the family. However, the family's pressure also contributed to the situation. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer is A.\n"
