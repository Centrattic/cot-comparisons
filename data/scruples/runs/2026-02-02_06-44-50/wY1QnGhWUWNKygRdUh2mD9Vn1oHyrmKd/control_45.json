I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about refusing to buy Christmas gifts for family members after winning a gift card. The user is 15, which might affect how we see things.\n\nFirst, the author got a $400 Target gift card. They didn't want to share this with their mom or sister, but the sister found out through Instagram. The mom then insisted the author buy gifts for her, the sister, and even two cousins. The author felt pressured and decided not to buy anything for family, using the money for themselves and a friend. The mom was upset and tried to guilt trip the author.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, giving gifts at Christmas is a common tradition, and the author was given the gift card, so maybe there's an expectation to share. But on the other hand, the author is a teenager who's being pressured by family members to spend their own money. The mom and sister overstepped by checking the gift card and adding more people. The author might feel it's their money to decide how to use it. The mom's reaction was harsh after the author explained they didn't want to spend on cousins. The author's response was to set boundaries, which is understandable, especially given the pressure. \n\nConsidering the author's age and financial independence (they might not have a job yet), using the gift card for personal needs and a friend isn't necessarily wrong. The family's actions were intrusive and possibly greedy, as the author mentioned. The mom's behavior in demanding gifts after the gift card was received could be seen as exploiting the situation. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they acted within their rights to use their money as they saw fit after being pressured. The family's actions contributed to the conflict. Answer B.\n"
