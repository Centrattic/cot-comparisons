I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation first. The author is 15 years old and received a $400 Target gift card. They posted about it on Instagram, where their sister saw. The sister called to ask about it, and the author specifically told her not to tell their mom. But then the mom came in right after and asked for the gift card. The author gave it to her, but the mom told them they had to get gifts for her and the sister. The author agreed but was very conservative with money.\n\nThen, when the author was at Target, they got a call from their mom adding two more cousins to the list. The author is frustrated because the cousins are young, and they don't interact much with them. They refuse and instead spend the money on themselves and a friend. The mom gets upset, gives them an \"ass chewing,\" and the author blames the mom's greed for their decision to keep future assets private.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's consider the key points. The author had the money to spend, but they chose not to buy gifts for family members that their mom suddenly added. The mom's behavior might be seen as pushy or taking the gift card as a given for family gifts. The author felt pressured and decided to use the money for personal expenses instead. \n\nAt 15, the author is a minor, so they might still be expected to follow family traditions or parental expectations, especially concerning spending. However, the mom's actions seem to be partly to blame for the initial expectation. The author tried to set boundaries by not telling their mom about the gift card, then the mom found out and added more demands. The author might be justified in feeling that their mom was inconsiderate, but refusing to buy any gifts could be seen as selfish, especially for younger cousins who might not expect much. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the author being conservative with money. They were saving the gift card for their own needs and then being pressured to spend it on others. The mom's approach of being \"obnoxious\" and pushing for more gifts after the initial request could have crossed a line. The author's response, while perhaps rude, was a result of that pressure. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the expectations are reasonable. The mom's sudden inclusion of cousins after the initial request might be unreasonable, especially if the author wasn't prepared for that. The author's age is a factor here; they might not have the same financial independence as an adult. However, not buying any gifts for family, even if pressured, can be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBut the author did buy gifts for themselves and a friend, which might be a red flag. Also, the mom's behavior of being pushy and guilt-tripping is part of the problem. The key issue is whether the author's refusal was justified given the circumstances. \n\nConsidering all angles, the author's actions might not be entirely wrong because the mom's demands were sudden and perhaps excessive. The author had the right to decide how to use their own money, even if it's a gift card they received. However, completely refusing to buy gifts for family, especially expecting a holiday with them, could be seen as inconsiderate. But since the author was pressured and the mom's behavior was part of the problem, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural expectations around gift-giving. If the family expects reciprocal gifts, the author might be in the wrong. But if the mom overstepped by adding more people after the fact, then the author's refusal is more understandable. \n\nSo, the author's decision to not buy gifts for the cousins could be justified, especially if they were not part of the initial plan. However, not getting anything for mom and sister, even if they were the first to be mentioned, might be a different matter. The author's argument that the mom was greedy and taking their money without consent adds another layer. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's a gray area. The answer could be B (No) if the mom's demands were unreasonable and the author was within their rights to set boundaries. However, if the author should have considered family expectations despite the pressure, then A (Yes). Given that the author was pressured, and the mom's actions were part of the problem, B seems more likely.\n"
