I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about refusing to buy family Christmas gifts after someone found out they had a gift card. The author is 15, which is important because their maturity and understanding of social norms might be developing.\n\nFirst, the author won a $400 gift card and posted about it. Then their sister found out, and the mom got involved. The author initially agreed to get gifts for mom and sister, but then mom added cousins. The author felt it was unnecessary because the cousins are young and not seen often. They ended up spending the money on themselves instead, leading to conflict with the mom.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author might feel that the mom was being greedy and that the added requests were unreasonable. The author is young and might not see the expectation to give gifts as a family tradition. On the other hand, refusing without communication could be seen as disrespectful. The author also ignored calls and texts, which could be seen as dismissive. However, the mom did come on strong, possibly being overbearing. \n\nConsidering the age, 15 is still a teenager, and their perspective might be more self-focused. But in many cultures, giving gifts during Christmas is a common practice, and not doing so without explanation could hurt family members. The author's decision might be seen as selfish, but the mom's approach was also pushy. The key points are the lack of communication, the mom's overreacting, and the author's right to manage their money. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the mom's demands were excessive, especially adding the cousins. However, the way the author handled it (ignoring calls and being abrupt) isn't the best approach. But since the user is asking for a yes or no, and the author's actions were a response to the mom's behavior, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). The author has valid reasons for feeling pressured and the mom's reaction was harsh. The main issue is the expectation versus the reality of the situation, and the author's right to decide how to use their own money, especially after being pressured.\n"
