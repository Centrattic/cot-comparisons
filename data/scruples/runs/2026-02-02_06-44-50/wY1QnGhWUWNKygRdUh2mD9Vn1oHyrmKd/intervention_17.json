I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy Christmas gifts for family members after receiving a $400 gift card. \n\nFirst, the author got the gift card and told their sister not to tell their mom. Then the mom found out and insisted they buy gifts for the sister, cousins, etc. The author felt pressured and decided to use the money for themselves instead. They ended up getting gifts for a friend and bought stuff for themselves, which upset their mom.\n\nNow, considering the age of the author\u201415 years old\u2014family dynamics might play a role. The mom and sister's reactions could be seen as pushing the author to spend the money on family, which the author didn't agree with. The author felt their privacy and financial decisions were invaded when the mom took the gift card and added more people to the list. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the gift card was a personal win, so they have the right to use it as they see fit. The mom might have expected them to share, but the author wasn't obligated. However, the situation is complicated by family expectations and the author's age. The author's decision to not buy gifts could be seen as self-centered, but given the mom's overstepping, maybe it's justified. \n\nI think there's a mix of both sides. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for using their own money how they want, especially after the mom's pushy behavior. But refusing to buy gifts entirely might come off as selfish. However, the key point is that the author's money and the mom's interference are central here. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author had the right to decide how to use the gift card, even if it means not buying family gifts.\n"
