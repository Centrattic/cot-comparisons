I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about Christmas gifts and some family dynamics. The user is 15 years old, which is a key point. \n\nFirst, the author won a $400 Target gift card and posted about it on Instagram. His sister saw it and told their mom, even though he had asked her not to. The mom then pressured him to buy gifts for the sister and later the cousins. The author felt this was unfair, especially since the cousins are young and he doesn't see them often. He refused, bought himself stuff instead, and got into an argument with his mom.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author was wrong to refuse buying gifts for family. In many cultures, exchanging gifts during Christmas is a common tradition, especially for family. However, the author was given the money as a gift, which he might consider his to use as he wishes. The pressure from his mom to use it for others could be seen as a conflict here.\n\nHe did initially plan to get gifts for his mom and sister, but the mom added more people (cousins) and expected him to spend thoughtfully. The author found this excessive, especially since he doesn't see the cousins much. He changed his mind because of the pressure and used the money for himself. \n\nThe mom's reaction was to yell and guilt-trip him. The author's response was defensive, which led to a confrontation. Now, whether he's in the wrong depends on perspectives. On one hand, he's a teenager with his own money, and it's his choice to spend it as he likes. On the other hand, in some family contexts, there's an expectation to share or give gifts, especially when others are involved. \n\nThe author's argument is that the family members were being greedy and overstepping by pressuring him. His mom might feel that he should contribute to family traditions. However, the way the mom handled it\u2014adding more people and expecting \"thoughtful\" gifts\u2014could be seen as unreasonable, especially with the age and relationship with the cousins. \n\nConsidering the age of the author, 15, he might not have a lot of financial leeway, and the gift card was a windfall. The pressure from the family to use it for gifts when he was already planning to buy some, then adding more people, could be overwhelming. His decision to prioritize his own needs after feeling pressured might be justified. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of respect and family expectations. Even if he feels it's his money, refusing to give any gifts could be seen as inconsiderate. However, in this case, he did buy some gifts for his friend and himself, which might be seen as reasonable. The key is that the family's demands were unexpected and excessive, leading to his decision to stop. \n\nSo, balancing both sides, I think the author isn't necessarily wrong. The family's approach might have been the issue here. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
