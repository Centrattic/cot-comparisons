I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the 15-year-old is in the wrong for refusing to buy Christmas gifts for family members after someone else found out about a gift card.\n\nFirst, the kid got a $400 Target gift card and shared it on Instagram. His sister saw it and told their mom, which he didn't want. Then, when he went to buy gifts, his mom kept adding more people he had to get gifts for. He decided not to buy any gifts for them because of how pushy they were. \n\nHe used the money for himself and a friend. His mom was upset and felt he should have bought gifts. The kid is defending himself by saying they were being greedy and he wanted to keep his money. \n\nSo, is he wrong? Well, family dynamics can be tricky. In many cultures, especially in Western ones, exchanging gifts during Christmas is a common tradition. However, the situation here is complicated by the pressure from his mom and the fact that she kept adding more people after their initial conversation. The kid is 15, which is a teenager, and they might not have a lot of money. The mom might expect that if he has the means, he should contribute to family traditions. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom did call him out after the fact, which led to an argument. The kid feels that his mom and sister were inconsiderate by not respecting his wishes after he had already decided to use the money. The key points here are the pressure from the family and the kid's right to manage his own money. \n\nIs it fair for the family to expect gifts? It depends on family norms. If the family usually exchanges gifts and the kid is able to contribute, then maybe there's an expectation. But if the family is adding people without considering the kid's financial situation or his initial reluctance, that's where the issue lies. \n\nThe kid did mention he's very conservative with money, so maybe he's not in a position to spend $400 on multiple family members, especially for cousins he doesn't see often. Also, the mom's initial reaction of being obnoxious and then the guilt-tripping might not be helpful. \n\nIn terms of cultural expectations, some might say it's a tradition to give gifts, but others might argue that it's his money to spend as he chooses. Since he's a minor, there might be a parental expectation to some extent, but the pushy behavior could have backfired. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be a mix of both. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the family pressures him beyond reasonable expectations and he's using his own money, then maybe he's justified. However, in some contexts, refusing to participate in a family tradition could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBut given the circumstances, the mom and sister's pressure, and the fact that he's a teenager with limited resources, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
