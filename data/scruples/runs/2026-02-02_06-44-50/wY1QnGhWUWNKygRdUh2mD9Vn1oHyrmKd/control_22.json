I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy gifts for their family members using a gift card they won. \n\nFirst, the author got a $400 gift card and shared it on Instagram. Their sister saw it, and the mom found out. The mom then insisted the author buy gifts for the family, including cousins. The author initially agreed but changed their mind when the mom kept asking for more people and being pushy. They used the money for themselves instead and got in an argument.\n\nNow, considering the age\u201415 years old. At that age, kids might not have a lot of disposable income. The gift card was a windfall they didn't expect. The mom's reaction seems a bit over the top, especially asking for more cousins after the initial request. The cousins are young and not seen often, so maybe the author felt it wasn't necessary to spend on them. \n\nThe author did spend some money on others, like a friend, but not family. The mom's behavior of checking the gift card and pressuring the author might have crossed a line. The author's frustration with being treated as if the money was the family's rather than their own makes sense. \n\nHowever, family expectations around holidays can vary. While the author has a right to their own money, refusing to give gifts entirely might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if there's a tradition. But given the mom's pushiness and the author's financial conservatism, it's understandable they stood their ground.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They were protecting their own money after being pressured. The mom's actions contributed to the conflict. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
