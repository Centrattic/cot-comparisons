I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy family members Christmas gifts. The situation involves the author receiving a $400 gift card, which they initially didn't want their mom to know about. But their sister found out and told their mom, leading to the mom pressuring the author to buy gifts for the family, including cousins. The author then spends the money on themselves and a friend, leading to a conflict with their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 15 years old, which is a minor. At that age, financial independence is still developing, and family dynamics can be tricky. The author's mom and sister might have different expectations about gift-giving. The author felt pressured when the mom added more people to the list after the initial request. The author's frustration stems from the mom's sudden demands and the feeling that their money was being controlled.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author's mom and sister pressured them to use the gift card for family gifts without considering the author's own spending plans. 2) The author felt the requests were excessive, especially for cousins they don't see often. 3) The author decided to spend the money on themselves and a friend, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. From a traditional perspective, refusing to give gifts to family might be seen as inconsiderate, especially during Christmas. However, the author's reasoning is that they were being pressured and that the gifts were for people they don't interact with much. The amount of money ($400) could be significant for a 15-year-old, and the author might feel entitled to spend it as they wish, especially since the gift card was a personal win.\n\nThe mom's actions\u2014like bursting into the room, pressuring for more people, and the obnoxious tone\u2014could be seen as overbearing. The author's decision to stop buying gifts after feeling manipulated is a reaction to that pressure. The argument here is about boundaries and autonomy. The author might believe they have the right to control their own money, even if it's a gift card they won.\n\nHowever, in family contexts, there's often an unspoken expectation to reciprocate or share, especially with immediate family. The author's mom might feel that the gift card was a windfall that should be used to benefit the family. The author's refusal could be seen as breaking social norms, even if the pressure was excessive.\n\nBut considering the author's age and the fact that they are still under their parents' care, there's an argument that they should respect their parents' wishes to some extent. However, the author was trying to manage their own money after winning it, which is a valid point. The mom's approach might have been too authoritarian, leading to the author's resistance.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers both sides. Here, the author's justification is that the pressure was unwarranted, and the money was their own. The mom's justification is expecting a family tradition and sharing. The author isn't wrong for wanting to set boundaries, especially if they felt coerced. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a cultural expectation in the US for giving gifts during Christmas. If so, the author might be in the wrong for not participating, but if the pressure was too much, it's a gray area.\n\nAlternatively, some might argue that the author was right to prioritize their own needs after being pressured, especially since the gift card was a personal win. The mom's reaction might have been overly harsh. So, the answer could be B.\n"
