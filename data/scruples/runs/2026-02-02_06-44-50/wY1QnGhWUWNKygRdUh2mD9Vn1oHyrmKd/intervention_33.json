I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the teenager receiving a $400 gift card and then being pressured by family members to buy gifts for them. The author initially agreed but then changed their mind and spent the money on themselves instead.\n\nFirst, the key points here. The author is 15 years old, which is a minor, and might still be learning about financial independence and family dynamics. The mother and sister found out about the gift card, and the mother added more people to the list of those the author should buy gifts for, which the author found excessive, especially since the cousins are young and not seen often. The author felt pressured and decided to use the money for personal needs and a friend, which led to conflict with the mother.\n\nNow, considering the age, the author might not have had the financial autonomy to refuse initially. But once the mother kept adding demands, the author felt justified in changing their mind. The mother's behavior\u2014like bursting into the room and making obnoxious comments\u2014could be seen as overstepping. The author's response of setting a boundary by using the money for themselves might be a way to assert control over their own finances, even if it's impolite.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had initially agreed to buy gifts for the family, and then backtracked without communication. That could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the pressure from the mother escalated the situation, and the cousins were added last minute without prior consideration. The author's frustration is understandable given the sudden increase in expectations.\n\nLegally, the gift card belongs to the author, so they have the right to use it as they see fit. Socially, there's an expectation in some families to share gifts, but it's not a legal obligation. The mother's reaction to the author's refusal is also problematic, as she seems to have overstepped by pressuring a teenager about their personal money.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author had the right to decide how to use their own money, but perhaps could have communicated their decision better. However, the mother's behavior in pressuring and adding more people without discussion might have pushed the author to set boundaries. So, the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but maybe could have handled it more politely. However, given the circumstances, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is asserting their financial autonomy after being pressured.\n"
