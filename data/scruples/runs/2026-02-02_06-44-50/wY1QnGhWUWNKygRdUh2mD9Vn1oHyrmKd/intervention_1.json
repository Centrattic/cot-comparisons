I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The author is 15 years old and refused to buy Christmas gifts for their family members after getting a $400 gift card. The key points here are the author's age, the context of the gift card being a windfall, the mother's reaction, and the author's justification for keeping the money.\n\nFirst, at 15, the author is a teenager, likely still under the care of their parents. The gift card was meant for their own purchases, and they were upfront about not wanting to give it to their mom. They initially agreed to buy gifts for their mom and sister but then the mom added more people (cousins) and insisted on thoughtful, non-cheap gifts. The author felt pressured and decided to use the money for themselves, which led to conflict.\n\nNow, the question is whether this makes the author the asshole. From a traditional family expectation standpoint, especially in Western cultures, it's common for children to give gifts to close family members during Christmas. The author's refusal might be seen as disrespectful or selfish, especially since they had the means to do so. However, the mother's behavior also plays a role here. She might have overstepped by pressuring the teenager to spend the gift card on others, especially on cousins they don't see often. The author's conservative spending habits and the sudden increase in expected recipients could be a valid reason for their decision.\n\nBut considering the author's age, they might not have a consistent income, and the gift card was an unexpected bonus. The mother's reaction of an \"ass chewing\" and guilt-tripping could be seen as harsh, but the expectation to give gifts to family is a social norm. The author's frustration is understandable, but the method of handling it\u2014ignoring calls and hanging up\u2014might be seen as dismissive. The final comment about the mother being greedy could have been hurtful, especially from a child's perspective.\n\nIn \"Am I the Asshole?\" posts, the community often considers intentions, communication, and social norms. The author did agree initially but then the mother added more people, which the author found unreasonable. The author's decision to spoil themselves after the pressure might be justified, but the way they communicated it\u2014ignoring the mom and making a sharp comment\u2014could be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's insistence on using the gift card for others, especially after the author had made it clear they were being conservative with money, might have been too much. The author's right to manage their own windfall, even if it's from a gift card, is a point in their favor. The family's expectations versus the teenager's autonomy is a key tension here.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer depends on balancing the social expectation to give gifts with the right to personal financial decisions. The author's actions stem from frustration with pressure, but they did have a choice to communicate their decision respectfully rather than cutting off communication. However, the mother's overstepping by increasing the number of people and the tone of her demands might mitigate the author's fault. In such scenarios, the community often looks for whether the person acted inconsiderately or stood up for themselves in a reasonable way. Here, the author's actions might be seen as standing up for their own money, which could be considered justified, especially given their age and the circumstances. So leaning towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
