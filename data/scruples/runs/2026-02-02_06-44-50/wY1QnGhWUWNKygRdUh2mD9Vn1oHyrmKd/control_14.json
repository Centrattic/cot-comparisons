I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is 15 years old and received a $400 Target gift card. They didn't want to spend it all on family gifts because they found the pressure from their mom and sister to be obnoxious. The mom added more people (the cousins) after the initial request. The author decided to keep the money for themselves and a friend, leading to conflict with their mom.\n\nFirst, the age of the author is a factor. At 15, they might be developing their own sense of independence and financial responsibility. The gift card was a windfall, so they might feel it's their money to use as they see fit. However, in many families, there's an expectation to share or give gifts, especially around Christmas. \n\nBut the mom's behavior seems to be a key issue here. She asked for gifts, then added more people without the author's consent. The author felt pressured and frustrated, leading them to change their mind. The mom's insistence might have been perceived as greedy, which the author pointed out. \n\nThe author's decision to not give gifts could be seen as selfish, but considering the pressure and the fact that the cousins are young and not seen often, maybe the author's choice is understandable. Also, the mom's reaction of yelling and guilt-tripping might exacerbate the situation.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't legally obligated to give gifts, especially if they're a minor but managing their own money. However, culturally, there's an expectation to participate in gift-giving, which the author refused. But the mom's overstepping by adding more people and being demanding could justify the author's frustration. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific family dynamics. Since the author is 15 and learning about financial independence, this might be a growing pain. The mom might need to adjust her expectations, but the author's refusal could be seen as inconsiderate. However, given the mom's behavior, the author's stance might be valid. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're standing up against unreasonable pressure. The mom's actions were more problematic. So the answer is B.\n"
