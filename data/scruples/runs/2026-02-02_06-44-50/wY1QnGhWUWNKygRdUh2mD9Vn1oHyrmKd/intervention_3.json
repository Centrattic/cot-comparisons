I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a 15-year-old who received a $400 gift card and decided not to spend it on family members after feeling pressured.\n\nFirst, the author got a gift card and shared it on Instagram. His sister saw it, called him, and he told her not to tell their mom. But the mom still found out, which led to her expecting gifts. The mom then added more people to the list, which annoyed the author. He refused to spend the money and instead bought himself things. His mom got upset and there was an argument.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he was given a gift, which he had control over. The mom and family members pressured him to use the gift card for them, which he felt was pushing. The author is 15, so maybe his perspective is different. He might not have a lot of money, so being conservative makes sense. The mom's behavior seems to be the main issue here\u2014using the gift card as a way to get gifts for others without considering his feelings or financial limits. The author's decision to prioritize his own needs after being pressured could be justified. He had the right to choose how to use his money, especially since it was a gift he received. The mom's expectation and the way she added more people without asking might be the real problem here. The author's response, while maybe abrupt, is a reaction to the pressure. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the pressure from the family and the mom's behavior are more to blame.\n"
