I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user wants a simple A or B answer, but I need to think through the situation thoroughly first.\n\nSo, the author is 15 years old and got a $400 gift card. They initially intended to buy gifts for their family members, including their mom and sister. But after the mom insisted on adding more people (the cousins), the author decided to keep all the money for themselves. The mom then got upset and guilt-tripped the author.\n\nFirst, the author didn't have a legal obligation to spend the money on family. The gift card was a prize, so it's their money to use as they see fit. However, in some cultures or families, there might be unspoken expectations around sharing, especially during Christmas. The mom might have thought that since the author had the money, they should buy gifts for extended family. But the author found this pushy, especially since the cousins are young and not seen often. \n\nThe author's frustration seems justified because the mom kept expanding the list without considering the author's feelings or financial responsibility. The author is conservative with money, which is a good trait, and felt pressured. The mom's behavior of bursting into the room, calling the author after they already went shopping, and then being upset when the gifts weren't given could be seen as overstepping. \n\nAt 15, the author is still learning about financial independence and personal boundaries. The mom's \"greedy\" behavior and lack of respecting the author's decision to use the money for themselves might have been the real issue here. The author defending their choice by spending on self-care items and a friend makes sense, especially if they felt coerced into spending more than they wanted. \n\nHowever, refusing to buy gifts altogether might be seen as inconsiderate in some contexts. But given the mom's pushy attitude, the author's reaction is understandable. The key points are consent and pressure. The author wasn't obligated to buy gifts, and the mom's insistence crossed a line. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The mom's behavior was more problematic here. The answer should be B.\n"
