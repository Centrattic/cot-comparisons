I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy family members Christmas gifts after getting a $400 gift card. \n\nFirst, the user is 15 years old. That's pretty young, so maybe expectations are different. The gift card was a random win, and he shared it on social media. His sister found out, and his mom got involved. The mom and sister started pressuring him to buy gifts for them and others, even adding more people like cousins. The user felt this was excessive and decided to use the money for himself instead. He got some things for himself and a friend, but not for family. The mom was upset and there was a fight.\n\nHmm, so the user's reasoning: he's conservative with money, the family kept adding more people, and the younger cousins don't see him much. He felt pressured when the mom kept calling and adding to the list. His mom tried to guilt-trip him, which he resented. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, family might expect gifts, especially if they're given a gift card. But on the other, the user isn't an adult and is managing his own money. The family's behavior seems to have escalated\u2014initially it was mom and sister, then cousins were added. The user might feel that the pressure was unreasonable. \n\nIs it the user's fault for not giving gifts? In many cultures, especially in Western ones, giving gifts is a tradition. However, the user isn't obligated to do so, especially if he has his own money. The problem here might be the family's approach\u2014being obnoxious and adding more people without considering his feelings or financial habits. \n\nHe did initially agree to buy gifts but changed his mind when the pressure increased. The fact that he bought gifts for a friend might show he's willing to spend on others, just not the family. His mom's reaction was harsh, maybe contributing to the conflict. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? Some might argue that family traditions matter, but others might say he has the right to his money. Since he's 15, maybe he's learning about financial independence and boundaries. The fact that the mom and sister overstepped by adding more people and being pushy complicates things. \n\nIn terms of answer, maybe the user isn't entirely in the wrong. The family's behavior was part of the problem. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong). But some might say he should have stuck with his initial plan if he agreed. However, the escalation from mom and sister led him to change his mind. So I think the answer is B. He's not in the wrong because he's managing his own money and the family's reaction was part of the issue.\n"
