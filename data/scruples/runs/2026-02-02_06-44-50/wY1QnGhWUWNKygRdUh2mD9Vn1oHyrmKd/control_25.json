I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy family members Christmas gifts after receiving a $400 Target gift card. \n\nFirst, the author received the gift card and initially didn't plan to use it for others. They told their sister not to tell their mom, but the mom found out and started pressuring them to buy gifts for multiple family members. The author felt this pressure was excessive, especially for cousins they don't see often. They ended up spending the money on themselves and a friend, leading to a confrontation with their mom.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. Legally, the gift card is the author's money, so they have the right to spend it as they see fit. However, socially and culturally, there's an expectation in many families to exchange gifts, especially during Christmas. The author's mom and sister may have felt entitled to gifts once they learned about the gift card, which is a common issue in families. The author's frustration comes from being pressured to share their money, especially when they value being conservative with their finances. \n\nThe author's actions were a reaction to perceived greed and pressure from their mother. They stood up for their own financial boundaries, which is understandable. However, the way they handled it\u2014refusing to buy gifts and then confronting their mom\u2014might be seen as inconsiderate, especially considering they are only 15. At that age, family expectations can be strong, and the situation might have been handled more diplomatically. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom's approach was overbearing, adding more people to the list and being \"obnoxious\" about it. The author's decision to prioritize their own needs after that pressure isn't necessarily wrong. Financial independence is important, even at a young age. The key point is whether the author acted unreasonably given the circumstances. The mom initiated the pressure by taking the gift card and adding more demands, so the author's reaction is a defense of their own autonomy.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't in the wrong because they had the right to decide how to use their money, especially after being pressured. The family's expectations were unrealistic, and the author's response was a valid assertion of personal choice.\n"
