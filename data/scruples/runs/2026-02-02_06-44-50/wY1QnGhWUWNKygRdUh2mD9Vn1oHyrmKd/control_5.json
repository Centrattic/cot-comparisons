I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy Christmas gifts for their family. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the context: The author is 15 years old and received a $400 Target gift card. They initially planned to buy gifts for their mom and sister but then the mom added cousins to the list. The author felt pressured and decided to spend the money on themselves instead. The mom was upset and accused them of being greedy.\n\nSo, the main points here are about money management and family expectations. The author is a teenager, which might influence their perspective. They mention being very conservative with money, so the pressure to spend on family might have been a trigger. The mom's behavior seems to have escalated, adding more people to the gift list, which the author found unreasonable, especially since the cousins are young and not often seen.\n\nNow, the key question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, refusing to buy gifts could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if family members expected it. On the other hand, the mom's approach was obnoxious, adding more people after the initial request, which might have pushed the author to their limit. The author also has a right to manage their own money, especially since it was a gift they won. The fact that they bought something for a friend shows they weren't being selfish entirely.\n\nConsidering the author's age and financial situation, they might not have a steady income, so spending $400 on gifts for multiple people could be a big burden. The mom's reaction and the pressure applied might have been unfair. However, there's an expectation in many families to give gifts, so the author's refusal could be seen as a breach of that norm. But given the circumstances and the mom's overreach, the author's decision might be understandable.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. If the family had a mutual understanding about gift-giving beforehand, then maybe the author's refusal is justified. However, if there was an unspoken expectation, the author might be seen as not fulfilling their part. However, the mother's behavior in adding more people without considering the teenager's financial comfort is problematic. The author's response to set boundaries could be seen as a positive, even if it caused family conflict.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because they stood up for their financial boundaries, especially given the mom's pressure. They also have a right to decide how to use their own money. The mother's part in escalating the situation is a significant factor here. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
