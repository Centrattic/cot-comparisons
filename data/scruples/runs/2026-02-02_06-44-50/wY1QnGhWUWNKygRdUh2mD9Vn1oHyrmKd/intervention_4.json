I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy Christmas gifts for their family members. The situation involves the author winning a gift card, sharing it on social media, and then family members pressuring them to use the card for gifts. The author ends up buying themselves stuff and refusing to buy gifts, leading to a conflict with their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 15 years old, which might affect their perspective on money and family obligations. At that age, they might be more focused on their own desires and less on traditional family expectations. The key points here are about the pressure from family members and the author's reaction.\n\nThe author received a gift card and initially agreed to buy gifts for their mom and sister. Then the mom added two more cousins, which the author found unreasonable because the cousins are young and not seen often. The author felt pressured and decided to spend the money on themselves instead. The mom was upset, leading to an argument.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Traditionally, giving gifts is a cultural norm, especially during Christmas. However, the author might not have an obligation to do so, especially if they didn't agree to it upfront. The family members, particularly the mom, came in and demanded gifts after the author had already planned to use the money. The pressure seems to be a significant factor here.\n\nThe author's decision to prioritize their own spending could be seen as selfish, but the context of the pressure and the sudden expansion of the list might justify their actions. The mom's reaction might also be harsh, expecting the author to spend on people they don't see often. The author's age is a factor; they might be learning to set boundaries and manage their money independently.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did agree initially to get gifts for mom and sister, but then the list expanded. The author's frustration with the pressure and the unreasonable extension of the list might make their decision understandable. The mom's behavior\u2014coming into the room, being obnoxious, and adding more people\u2014could be seen as overstepping.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the author felt pressured and the family members didn't respect their initial agreement. The author might not be entirely in the wrong. However, the expectation of gift-giving exists, and not participating could be seen as inconsiderate. But given the circumstances, especially the pressure and the sudden changes, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). Alternatively, if the author should have stood their ground from the start, maybe A. But I think the key here is the pressure and the unreasonable demands. So leaning towards B.\n"
