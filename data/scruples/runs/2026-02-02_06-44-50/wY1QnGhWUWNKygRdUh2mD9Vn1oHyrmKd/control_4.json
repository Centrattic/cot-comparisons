I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again to understand the context.\n\nThe author is 15 years old and received a $400 Target gift card. They initially told their sister not to tell their mom, but the mom found out anyway. Then the mom and sister started pressuring the author to buy gifts for them and other family members, including cousins who are young and not seen often. The author felt this was obnoxious and decided to spend the money on themselves instead. The mom got upset and there was an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the author. At 15, they might still be learning about financial independence and social expectations around gifting. However, in many cultures, it's customary to buy gifts for family members during Christmas, especially when you receive a gift card. The author's mom might have expected that, given the amount they received.\n\nThe author felt pressured by the mom's demands. The mom's approach seems to be more about getting gifts without considering the author's feelings or financial boundaries. The author's response was to spend the money on themselves, which could be seen as standing up for their own needs. However, refusing to buy gifts for family might be seen as inconsiderate in some contexts.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the mom breaking the author's trust by getting the gift card without permission. The author had asked the sister not to tell the mom, so when the mom found out and started pressuring, it might have been a breach of trust. This could justify the author's frustration.\n\nFinancial independence is important, and the author is being very conservative with their money. Using the gift card for personal needs and a friend makes sense from their perspective. The mom's insistence on buying gifts for multiple people, including not-so-close relatives, might have been excessive, especially with the author's limited means.\n\nHowever, the author did agree at first to buy gifts for mom and sister, but the mom added more people. The author then changed their mind. The key issue is the pressure applied by the family, which led to the author's decision to prioritize their own needs.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the author's age, the mom's pressure, the breach of trust, and the author's financial management, the author's actions might be justified as self-advocacy. The mom's behavior was likely more problematic here. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
