I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy family members Christmas gifts. The situation is that the author got a $400 gift card, shared it on Instagram, and then family members, particularly the mom, kept adding more people they should buy for. The author then decided to spend the money on themselves instead, leading to a conflict with the mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 15 years old, which is a teenager. At that age, people are still developing their independence and financial habits. The gift card was a windfall, and the author might not have had a history of buying gifts for their family. The mother approached the situation in a way that felt pushy and greedy to the author. The key points here are the age of the author, the unexpected pressure from family, and the author's decision to prioritize their own spending.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The traditional view might be that refusing to give gifts to family is inconsiderate, especially around Christmas. However, the author's reasoning is that the family members were being inconsiderate and greedy, adding more people after the initial request. The author is entitled to their own money, even if it's given by a family member. The mother's behavior seems to have been the catalyst, making the author feel forced to comply, which led to resentment.\n\nAge is a factor here. At 15, the author is still learning about financial responsibility and social norms. The mother's approach might have been too aggressive for their maturity level. The author's response, while perhaps blunt, is a reaction to perceived pressure. The fact that they bought themselves items and a friend a gift shows they aren't completely self-centered, just prioritizing their needs after feeling pushed.\n\nAnother angle is the expectation of gift-giving. In some families, there's an expectation to give gifts, but the author's situation involved a sudden influx of money that others immediately wanted to use. The author's decision to not spend on family after the pushback is a form of asserting control over their own money. The mother's guilt-tripping and the author's defensive response indicate a breakdown in communication and understanding of personal boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, it's more about the mother's handling of the situation being the issue rather than the author being wrong. The author is not in the wrong for choosing not to spend their own money as they see fit, especially after feeling pressured. The answer should be B, No.\n"
