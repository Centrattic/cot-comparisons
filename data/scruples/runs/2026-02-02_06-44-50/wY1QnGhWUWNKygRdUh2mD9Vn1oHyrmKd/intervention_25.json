I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about refusing to buy family members Christmas gifts after getting a $400 Target gift card. The user is 15, which is pretty young, so maybe their perspective is different.\n\nFirst, the author won the gift card and told their sister, who then told their mom. The mom and sister start pressuring the author to buy gifts for multiple family members, including their cousins. The author feels it's unfair and spends the money on themselves instead. They ended up getting an ass chewing from their mom.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, family traditions might involve gift-giving, and maybe the mom was just following that. But the author is 15, so maybe they have a right to be more independent with their money, especially if they earned or received it. The mom and sister overstepped by pressuring them, especially adding more people (the cousins) after the initial ask. The author felt it was excessive, especially since they don't see the cousins often. \n\nBut then, in some families, there's an expectation to give gifts to family members during the holidays. If the author isn't in a position to do that, maybe they should have communicated that earlier. However, the author was pressured into it after they had already planned to buy gifts for their mom and sister. The mom's reaction was obnoxious, and the author felt forced. \n\nThe key points here are the age of the person, the pressure applied by family members, and the author's decision to prioritize their own spending. The author isn't legally an adult, so their autonomy is still limited. But financially, if the gift card is their own money (as it seems to be), they have a right to spend it as they wish. The parents might expect some family contributions, but the way they handled it was pushy and possibly disrespectful to the teenager's wishes. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because the family pressured them into spending more than they wanted. The author had the right to set boundaries. However, maybe there's some responsibility in the situation. But given the context, the author's actions seem justified. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
