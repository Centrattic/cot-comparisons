I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the 15-year-old is in the wrong for refusing to buy Christmas gifts for their family after receiving a $400 Target gift card. \n\nFirst, the context: The kid won the gift card, told their sister, and then their mom found out and pressured them to buy gifts for multiple family members. The kid initially agreed but then changed their mind, spending the money on themselves and a friend instead. The mom was upset.\n\nSo, from a family tradition perspective, maybe the kid is expected to give gifts. But the kid is 15 and very conservative with money. The mom called after the kid was at Target, adding more people to the list. The kid felt the mom was being greedy and taking their money. \n\nI need to consider the age and the pressure from the family. At 15, the kid might not have a lot of financial independence. The mom might see the gift card as a way to provide for the family, but the kid feels it's their own money and doesn't want to be pressured. \n\nThe mom's actions\u2014being \"obnoxiously\" demanding and guilt-tripping\u2014could have been overbearing. The kid's response was to stand up for themselves, which might be seen as justified if the pressure was unreasonable. However, there's a cultural expectation around Christmas gifts, so maybe the kid is seen as not fulfilling that. \n\nBut the mom had the opportunity to ask earlier and instead added more demands later. The kid's frustration is understandable, especially if the cousins are young and the gifts could have been simple or even store-bought. The kid did spend some money on family (initially), but when pressured more, they decided to keep it. \n\nIn many cultures, especially in some families, there's an expectation to share such windfalls. However, the mom's behavior escalated the situation by being pushy and not respecting the kid's initial plan. The kid's reaction, while maybe a bit harsh, stems from feeling disrespected. \n\nSo, is the kid in the wrong? If the family has a tradition where everyone gets each other gifts, and the kid was part of that tradition, then maybe they should have discussed it earlier. But the mom's overstepping and the kid's financial responsibility are points in their favor. \n\nConsidering the mom's role in escalating the situation and the kid's right to manage their own money, the answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong). But there's also the aspect of family expectations. However, the kid is a minor and might not have that same level of obligation as adults. \n\nI think B is the right choice here. The kid had a valid reason to feel pressured and decided to prioritize their own needs after the mom's behavior. It's a matter of perspective, but the family's approach seems to have been the main issue.\n"
