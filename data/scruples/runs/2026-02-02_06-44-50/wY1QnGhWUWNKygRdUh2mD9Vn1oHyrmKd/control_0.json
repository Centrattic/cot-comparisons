I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not buying Christmas gifts for their family members. The situation involves the author receiving a $400 gift card, which their sister found out about. The mother then insisted they use it to buy gifts for the sister, cousins, and themselves, which the author refused, using the money for personal items instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. They're 15 years old, so their understanding of social norms and family expectations might still be developing. The key points here are the mother's demands and the author's reaction. The mother called the author obnoxiously and added more people to the list (even though the cousins are young and not seen often), which the author found unreasonable. The author felt pressured and decided to keep the money for themselves, leading to a conflict with the mother.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. From a traditional standpoint, giving gifts to family members is a common practice during Christmas, especially when someone receives a gift card. The author might be seen as selfish for not sharing, especially since they have the means. However, there's the aspect of the mother overstepping by demanding the use of the gift card for others, which the author didn't agree with. The author also mentions that they are very conservative with their money, so spending on family when pressured might not be their choice.\n\nThe mother's behavior seems manipulative. She used guilt-tripping and added unexpected people to the list, which could make the author feel coerced. The author's decision to prioritize their own well-being and financial prudence under such pressure might be justified. The fact that the cousins are young and not often seen could make the gifts less necessary, supporting the author's stance.\n\nHowever, not giving gifts at all, especially to immediate family like a mother and sister, can be seen as inconsiderate. But the mother's initial request was framed in a way that might have been unreasonable. The author's refusal was a reaction to the pressure, not a lack of resources. The age of the author (15) might mean they're still learning about balancing personal and family obligations, so their actions could be a natural response to perceived overreach.\n\nIn summary, while the author's actions might not align with traditional expectations, the context of the mother's demands and the author's financial conservatism are significant. The mother's behavior contributed to the conflict, and the author's decision to prioritize their own discretion in using the gift card could be seen as reasonable under the circumstances. So, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
