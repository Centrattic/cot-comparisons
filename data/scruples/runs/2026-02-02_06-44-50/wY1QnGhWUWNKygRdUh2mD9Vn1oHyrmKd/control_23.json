I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy Christmas gifts for their family members. The situation involves the author receiving a $400 gift card, which was then discovered by their family. The author initially agreed to buy gifts for their mom, sister, and cousins but later changed their mind, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 15 years old, which is important. At that age, financial responsibility might be a big deal, and they might have a limited income. The gift card was a windfall, and they wanted to use it for themselves. The family members, especially the mom and sister, acted in a way that felt pushy\u2014like the mom added more people (cousins) without prior notice. The author felt pressured, so they decided to spend the money on themselves instead.\n\nThe key points here are the age of the author, the sudden pressure from the family to buy gifts, and the fact that the cousins are young and not part of the author's regular life. The author's response was to prioritize their own spending after feeling the family was being greedy. \n\nI need to balance the family's expectations with the author's right to manage their own money. In many cultures, especially in Western societies, there's an expectation to give gifts during Christmas, but it's not a legal obligation. The author's decision to not buy gifts for family might be seen as rude in some contexts, but given the family's overreach, it could also be seen as a reasonable response to avoid being taken advantage of.\n\nAlso, considering the age, a 15-year-old might not be in a position to handle such pressures gracefully, and their reaction might stem from frustration. The mother's guilt-tripping and the sister's actions (like telling the mom) could have contributed to the author's decision. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't give gifts, which might be socially frowned upon, but they had a valid reason given the family's behavior. The answer might hinge on whether the family's actions were unreasonable and if the author's response was justified. Since the family added unexpected recipients and the author felt pressured, the answer could lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue that the author still could have given gifts despite the pressure. But given the context of the family's actions and the author's age, the more empathetic answer is B.\n"
