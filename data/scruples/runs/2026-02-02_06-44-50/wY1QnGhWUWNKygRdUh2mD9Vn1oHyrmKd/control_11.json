I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy family Christmas gifts after receiving a $400 gift card. \n\nFirst, the context: The author got a gift card, told their sister, then the mom found out. The mom and sister started pressuring the author to buy gifts for the whole family, including cousins. The author felt this was excessive, especially since the cousins are young and not often seen. They decided to use the money for themselves and a friend instead. The mom was upset and there was an argument.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author is 15, which is a minor, but the question is about whether they're in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, minors aren't typically held to adult responsibility, but the question is more about moral or social wrong.\n\nThe author was given a gift card, which is their money. They were pressured to spend it on gifts for others, which they felt was unreasonable. The parents might expect reciprocity in gift-giving, but the author felt it was excessive and not necessary. \n\nThe parents' behavior\u2014calling it \"greedy\" and \"obnoxious\"\u2014might be valid if they were being pushy. The author's decision to not buy gifts is a personal choice, especially since the money was a gift they received. However, in many cultures, there's an expectation to share gifts, especially during Christmas. But given the age, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for asserting their own wishes. \n\nBut does the author have a responsibility to share? If the gift card was a personal gift, the author isn't obligated to use it for family. However, the parents might see it as part of the family's resources, especially if they contributed to the child's upbringing. But the author's reasoning about the cousins being young and not seen often seems valid. \n\nThe conflict arose because the parents expected the author to use their own money for gifts, which the author felt was unfair. The author's response was to prioritize their own needs and a friend, which is a personal choice. The parents' reaction was harsh, but the author stands by their decision.\n\nConsidering all this, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't legally in the wrong, and they have a valid point about personal money use. However, socially, there might be expectations. But since the user is asking for a binary answer (A or B), and given the parents' overbearing behavior, the author's choice to not comply could be seen as justified. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
