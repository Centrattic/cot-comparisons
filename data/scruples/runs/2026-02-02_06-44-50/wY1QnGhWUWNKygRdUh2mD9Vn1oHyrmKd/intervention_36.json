I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is 15 years old and received a $400 Target gift card. Initially, they agreed to buy gifts for their mom and sister but later changed their mind after the mom added two cousins. The mom was seen as being \"obnoxious\" and the author felt pressured. The user then spent the money on themselves and a friend, leading to an argument with their mom.\n\nFrom the user's perspective, they felt coerced into spending more than they wanted. The mom kept adding people to the list, which the user found unreasonable, especially since they don't see the cousins often. The user's reaction was to stop giving gifts entirely and focus on their own needs. They also mentioned being very conservative with money, which is a valid point.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might have felt entitled to the gifts, especially since she found out about the gift card. Family expectations can be strong, and maybe the mom didn't communicate the pressure in a respectful way. However, the user did have initial plans to buy gifts but changed them after the mom's demands, which could be seen as breaking a prior agreement, even if it was verbal.\n\nThe user's decision to cut off communication and ignore calls might come off as abrupt. While the mom's behavior was pushy, the user's response was to spend the money on themselves without fulfilling the initial promise, which could be seen as selfish, especially considering family dynamics. However, the user is a teenager, and their budgeting and autonomy might be factors. The key here is whether the user's actions were within their rights given the pressure applied.\n\nConsidering all angles, the user might not be entirely in the wrong because they were pressured into an agreement and felt their boundaries were crossed. However, there's a case to be made that they should have managed the expectations better or communicated their limits earlier. The answer hinges on the context of the pressure versus personal responsibility.\n"
