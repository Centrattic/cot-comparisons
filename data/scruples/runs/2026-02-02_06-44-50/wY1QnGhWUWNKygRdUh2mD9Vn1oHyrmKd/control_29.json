I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 15-year-old who won a $400 gift card. They told their sister, who then probably told their mom. The mom got involved, and the user was pressured to spend the gift card on family members they don't see often\u2014mom, sister, and two young cousins. The user decided not to buy gifts for them and instead spent the money on themselves and a friend. The family had a big argument about it.\n\nFirst, the user's age is 15. At that age, people are still developing their sense of responsibility and social norms. But they're also learning about financial independence. The gift card was a personal win, so it's their money to spend as they like.\n\nThe mom and sister's actions: the mom suddenly added cousins to the list after the initial request. The user felt pressured, especially since the cousins are young and they don't interact much. The user's frustration is understandable because they had to make last-minute purchases while being given additional demands. The mom's tone was \"obnoxious,\" which likely added stress.\n\nThe user decided to spend the money on themselves and a friend. While some might say there's a family expectation to give gifts, especially around Christmas, others would argue that the user isn't obligated to share their personal windfall. The mom's reaction, including guilt-tripping and yelling, suggests that the pressure was excessive. The user's response, though maybe harsh, was about standing up for their own financial decisions. \n\nConsidering cultural norms, some families have expectations around gift-giving, but the user's age and the sudden pressure from the mom might make the user's actions more justifiable. The key points are the pressure applied and the user's right to spend their own money. So, the answer is B. The user isn't in the wrong because they were pressured and the money was theirs to use as they chose.\n"
