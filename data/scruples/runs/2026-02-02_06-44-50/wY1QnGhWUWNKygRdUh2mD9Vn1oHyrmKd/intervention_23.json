I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy family members Christmas gifts. The scenario is a bit detailed, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author got a $400 gift card and bragged about it on Instagram. His sister found out and told their mom, even though the author told her not to. The mom then insisted he buy gifts for his sister and later, even more for his cousins. The author felt pressured and decided to spend the money on himself instead. The mom got upset and there was an argument.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is wrong for not buying gifts. Let's consider the context. The author is 15, which is a teenager. At that age, they might not have a lot of disposable income, and the idea of being forced to spend money on gifts for relatives they don't see often (like cousins 6 and 2) could be frustrating. The mom's approach seems to be more about the author's money than genuine gifting. The mom's actions here might be seen as taking advantage, especially since she got the gift card from the author's own win, not her own money.\n\nThe author's response was to spend the money on himself because of the pressure. While it's true that in many cultures, giving gifts is a tradition, the author's reaction might be justified if the family was being overbearing. The fact that the author had the right to his own money (even if it was a gift card he won) is important. The family's insistence without considering his personal financial boundaries could be problematic.\n\nHowever, the author did initially agree to buy gifts for his sister and mom, then changed his mind after being pressured further for the cousins. The back-and-forth might have led to frustration. The key points are: the family's pressure, the author's right to his own money, and the age factor. \n\nIn many cases, especially in families, there's an expectation of reciprocity, but if the expectation is unreasonable or the method of obtaining the money is not the family's to begin with, the author's stance could be seen as reasonable. The mom's behavior\u2014being obnoxious and trying to take the gift card initially\u2014might indicate she was more interested in using the money for others rather than respecting the author's autonomy.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (author is not in the wrong). The pressure from the family and the way they handled the situation could justify the author's decision to keep the money for himself, especially since it's his own money and he's a teenager learning to manage it.\n"
