I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the person refusing to buy Christmas gifts for their family members after receiving a $400 gift card. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The writer is 15 years old. They won a gift card and initially agreed to buy gifts for their mom and sister after the mom asked. Then the mom added two cousins (ages 6 and 2), which the writer feels is excessive because they don't see them often. The writer then decides not to buy any gifts, which leads to a conflict with their mom.\n\nThe writer's main argument is that their family was being greedy and pushing them to spend the gift card money on others, so they chose to spend it on themselves instead. They feel justified because they don't get to see the cousins often and the family's demands were obnoxious.\n\nNow, considering the age of the person, 15, they might not have a job or a steady income. The gift card was a windfall, so they might not feel obligated to spend it on others. But in many cultures, especially in families, there's an expectation to share gifts, especially for close family members. However, the mom's approach might be seen as overstepping by adding more people after the initial request. The writer's frustration is understandable given the added pressure.\n\nThe key points here are: the sudden increase in the number of people to buy for, the mom's tone (\"be thoughtful, don't just get something cheap\"), the age of the person, and the fact that the gift card was a windfall. The writer's decision to prioritize their own spending might be seen as self-responsibility, but refusing all gifts could be seen as a breach of family expectations.\n\nHowever, the writer did consider getting gifts initially but felt pressured when the list expanded. The mom might have a point in expecting some sharing, but the way she handled it (adding more people without considering the writer's feelings) could be the problem. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the situation is a bit nuanced. The writer's actions might be seen as asserting their own financial boundaries, especially since the money was a gift card they won. However, refusing all gifts without some consideration for family could be seen as selfish. But given the context of the mom's behavior, maybe the writer isn't entirely at fault.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the expectations were reasonable. The writer's argument is that they were pressured to spend on people they don't see often, which might not be a typical expectation. The mom's approach was pushy, so the writer's refusal might be justified. Therefore, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the family's demands were excessive and the writer has the right to decide how to use their money.\n"
