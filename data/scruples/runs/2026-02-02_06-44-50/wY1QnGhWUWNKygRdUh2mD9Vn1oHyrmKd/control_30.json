I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for refusing to buy gifts for family members with the gift card they received. The author is 15 years old, which might be a factor. \n\nFirst, the context: The author won a $400 gift card, posted about it on Instagram, and then their sister found out. The mom then got involved and started pressuring the author to buy gifts for the sister and cousins. The author felt this was too much, especially since the cousins are young and not often seen. They ended up spending the money on themselves and a friend, leading to a confrontation with the mom.\n\nSo, the main points here are expectations around gift-giving, family pressure, and the age of the author. \n\nIn terms of cultural norms, gift-giving is common during Christmas, and families often have traditions. However, the author might feel that their personal money (even if it's a gift card) is their own to spend as they please. The mom's insistence on using it for family could be seen as overstepping, especially if the author wasn't consulted or agreed beforehand. \n\nThe author's age is 15, which is a teenager. At that age, they might be developing their own sense of autonomy and financial independence. The mom's reaction might have been too aggressive, leading the author to push back. The fact that the author was conservative with money and felt pressured could justify their decision.\n\nHowever, some might argue that in a family context, there's an expectation to share, especially when gifts are part of the holiday tradition. The author's refusal could be seen as disrespectful or inconsiderate, but considering the mom's behavior (like bursting into the room and being obnoxious), the author's frustration is understandable.\n\nThe key here is the balance between family expectations and personal autonomy. The author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to keep the money for themselves, especially if the family's demands were excessive. The mom's actions might have contributed to the conflict by not respecting the author's wishes. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the situation highlights the mom's overreach and the author's right to manage their own money, especially given their age and the circumstances described.\n"
