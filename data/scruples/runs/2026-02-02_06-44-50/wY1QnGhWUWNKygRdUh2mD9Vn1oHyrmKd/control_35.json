I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about refusing to buy Christmas gifts for family members after they found out about a $400 gift card. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author got a gift card, told their sister but asked her not to tell their mom. The mom found out, insisted they buy gifts for the sister, cousins, etc., and the author refused, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author is 15 years old. At that age, they might still be learning about family expectations and social norms. The family members (mom, sister, cousins) are expecting gifts because they found out about the gift card. The author felt pressured and decided to keep the money for themselves, which upset the family.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The mom and sister might have a right to feel entitled to gifts, especially if they found out about the money. But the author is a teenager who's managing their own money. The initial request was for mom and sister, then expanded to cousins. The author might feel it's unfair to have to spend on family they don't see often, like the cousins.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, in terms of family expectations, there's a cultural aspect. In some families, sharing gifts when you have extra is expected, especially if you're an adult. But the author is 15, not an adult. They might not be in a position to make those decisions, especially if they're still living at home or under their parents' care. Also, the mom's reaction was to use the gift card without permission, which could be seen as overstepping.\n\nThe author might have a valid point about the pressure and the family's greed. But then again, refusing to give any gifts could be seen as selfish. The answer might depend on the cultural context and family norms. However, since the user is asking for a yes or no, and the author's reasoning is about being forced to spend on people they don't see often, plus the mom's overreaction, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). The author has a reasonable stance given their age and the circumstances, even if the mom is upset. The family might have expected gifts but didn't consider the author's perspective or financial autonomy.\n"
