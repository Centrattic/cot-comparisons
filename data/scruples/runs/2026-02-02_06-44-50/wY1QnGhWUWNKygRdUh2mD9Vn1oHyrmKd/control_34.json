I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about refusing to buy family members Christmas gifts after getting a $400 gift card. The author is 15, so that's a teenager.\n\nFirst, the author received the gift card and told their sister, who then called mom. The mom then pressured the author to buy gifts for the sister, cousins, etc., using the gift card. The author felt pressured and decided to spend the money on themselves instead, leading to a conflict with the family.\n\nThe key points here are the pressure from the family and the age of the author. At 15, the author might not have a lot of financial independence, but they were given money. The question is whether they're obligated to share it with family. \n\nThe author's reasons for not buying gifts were because they were being pressured and wanted to keep the money for their own needs. They did buy a few things for themselves and a friend, which is understandable. However, the family expected gifts for multiple relatives, especially the cousins, which the author found unnecessary.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the author is young, and family expectations can be overwhelming. The pressure from the mom and sister might have been unreasonable, especially since the cousins are young and the family might not see them often. The author might have a right to keep the money. On the other hand, in some families, expecting gifts during Christmas is a tradition, and the author's refusal could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful.\n\nBut considering the age and the fact that the author is managing their own money, it's also about personal responsibility. The author might not be in the wrong for prioritizing their own needs after feeling pressured. Also, the mom's reaction was harsh, which could justify the author's decision. \n\nI think the answer would be B (No) because the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They were pressured, and using the money for personal needs is reasonable. Family traditions can vary, and the author's stance is about autonomy, which is valid, especially for a teenager learning about financial independence.\n"
