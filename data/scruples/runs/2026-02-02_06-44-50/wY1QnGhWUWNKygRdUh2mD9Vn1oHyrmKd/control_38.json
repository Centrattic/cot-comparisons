I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy Christmas gifts for their family members after getting a $400 gift card. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: The author is 15 years old. They won a gift card, posted about it on Instagram, and their sister saw. The mom then insisted they buy gifts for the sister, cousins, etc., which the author found obnoxious. They ended up using the money for themselves and a friend, leading to a conflict with their mom.\n\nSo, the main points here are about expectations and boundaries. The author is a teenager, which is relevant because their perspective on money and responsibilities might differ from adults. They mentioned being very conservative with money, which makes sense if they're still developing financial habits.\n\nThe mom's behavior seems to be a key issue. She found out about the gift card through the author's sister (possibly without the author's consent) and then added more people for gifts. The author felt pressured and decided to use the money for themselves, which led to an argument. The author argues that the mom was greedy and overstepped by wanting to use their money for gifts they didn't agree to buy in the first place.\n\nFrom the author's side, they might feel that their money is their own, even if it's a gift card. They might not feel obligated to share it with family members, especially when the request expanded to include cousins they don't see often. The mom's insistence after the author had already agreed to buy for the sister might have crossed a line, making the author feel forced, hence their refusal.\n\nOn the other hand, cultural or family expectations could play a role. In some cultures, it's customary to give gifts to family during the holidays, so the mom might have expected the author to participate. However, the author is a teenager, and their financial independence is still developing. They might not have the same level of responsibility to buy gifts for an extended family that they don't interact with regularly.\n\nThe mother's actions\u2014checking the gift card, adding more people, and then getting upset when the author didn't comply\u2014could be seen as overreaching. The author's reaction of asserting their right to their own money might be justified, especially if they felt coerced. The phrase \"kept your paws off my money\" suggests that the author felt their autonomy was violated.\n\nConsidering the age of the author, they might not have a job or significant income, so the gift card was a windfall. Using it for personal needs and a friend might be a reasonable choice if they perceive the family's requests as excessive. The mom's reaction to the author's decision could be seen as disproportionate, especially since the author had already communicated their discomfort.\n\nIn summary, while there's a conflict between the author's desire to keep their money and the family's expectations, the mother's behavior seems to have escalated the situation by adding more people and not respecting the author's initial boundaries. The author's decision to use the money for themselves, especially after the negative reaction they anticipated, could be seen as a valid choice given their age and the pressure they faced.\n"
