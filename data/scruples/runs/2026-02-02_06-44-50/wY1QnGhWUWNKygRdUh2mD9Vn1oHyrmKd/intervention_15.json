I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about refusing to buy Christmas gifts for family members after receiving a gift card. The author is 15, which is a minor, so maybe their perspective is different.\n\nFirst, the author got a $400 Target gift card, which they won. They told their sister, but told her not to tell their mom. The mom found out anyway, and then the author had to spend the gift card on family. The mom and sister kept adding more people (cousins) and being pushy about it. The author then decided to keep the money for themselves instead.\n\nThe key points here are the pressure from the family and the author's age. At 15, they might not have a lot of money, and being forced to spend a windfall on family could be stressful. The family members are acting entitled, especially since the cousins are young and the author doesn't see them often. The author felt pressured and decided to use the money for themselves instead.\n\nBut then there's the part where the author didn't follow through on the gifts after agreeing initially. They changed their mind after the family kept adding more people and being pushy. The mom was upset and tried to guilt-trip them, but the author stood their ground.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? On one hand, they were asked to buy gifts after receiving a gift card. But the family members were being overbearing, adding more people unexpectedly, and the author is a minor who might not have the financial means. The author's decision to prioritize their own needs after being pressured might be understandable. However, they did agree to get the initial gifts (mom and sister) and then changed their mind after the family added more people. That could be seen as breaking a commitment. But the family's behavior might have justified the author's reaction.\n\nI think the family's behavior is problematic, but the author's refusal to follow through after agreeing might be where they're in the wrong. But since they were under pressure and the added people were unexpected, maybe it's not entirely their fault. It's a bit of a gray area. The author is a teenager, so they might not have the same financial responsibilities as an adult.\n"
