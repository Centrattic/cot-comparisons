I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy Christmas gifts for family members after receiving a $400 gift card. The author is 15 years old, which I should consider.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author won a gift card and posted about it on Instagram. Their sister saw it, and the author told her not to tell their mom. But the mom found out anyway, entered the room, and insisted the author buy gifts for the mom, sister, and even cousins. The author felt pressured and decided to use the gift card for themselves instead, leading to a confrontation with the mom.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the expectations around gift-giving and the family dynamics. The author was given the gift card as a personal prize. They didn't initially plan to use it for others but changed their mind after the mom and sister intervened. The mom then expected more gifts, even adding cousins, which the author found unreasonable, especially since they don't see these cousins often. \n\nIn many cultures, giving gifts to family during Christmas is a common tradition. However, the author is only 15, and their perspective might be different. The mom's behavior seems to be a factor here\u2014she took the gift card and then added more people, which the author felt was greedy. The author's response was to cancel the family gifts and use the money for themselves, which might be seen as selfish, but their age and financial responsibility (being conservative) could mitigate that.\n\nThe author's argument is that the family was being greedy and pushing for more, so they decided to keep the gift card. The mom's reaction was harsh, and the author felt justified in standing up for themselves. Considering the mom's role in escalating the situation and the author's age, there might be a valid reason for their stance. However, the expectation to give gifts in a family setting is strong, so not giving any might be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nBut the author was already pressured to give gifts they weren't prepared to give, and the mom's reaction after the author stood their ground is problematic. The author might not be in the wrong because they were within their right to decide how to use the gift card they received. The family's behavior, especially the mom's, could be seen as the root issue. So, while the author's choice to not give gifts might be frowned upon, the context suggests it's not entirely their fault. The answer is likely B, No.\n"
