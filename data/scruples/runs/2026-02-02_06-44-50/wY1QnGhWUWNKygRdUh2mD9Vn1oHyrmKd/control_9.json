I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about them refusing to buy Christmas gifts for their family members after receiving a $400 Target gift card. \n\nFirst, the author got the gift card and told their sister, but then the sister told their mom. The mom then pressured the author to buy gifts for the author's sister, cousins, and maybe others. The author felt this was too much because the cousins are young and they don't see them often. They decided not to buy any gifts and used the money for themselves instead. The mom was upset and the author felt justified in their decision.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, giving gifts is a personal choice. The author might not have had a legal obligation to give gifts, so in terms of rights, they're not violating anything. However, in terms of family expectations and social norms, there's a cultural aspect where giving gifts is expected during Christmas. The author's family might have expected them to do so, especially if the gift card was seen as a way to provide for family.\n\nBut then there's the pressure from the mom. The author felt that the mom was being greedy and overstepping by getting the gift card and then controlling how it was spent. The mom's actions of taking the gift card and then adding more people to the list might have pushed the author to change their mind. The author's decision to spend the money on themselves could be seen as a stand against that pressure.\n\nConsidering the age of the author (15), they might not have a lot of financial independence yet, but they still have the right to manage their own money. The mom's reaction could be seen as overbearing, leading the author to withdraw from future financial sharing.\n\nSo, the key points are the pressure from family, the author's financial values, and the cultural expectations around gift-giving. The author's actions might be selfish, but the context of being pressured after a breach of privacy could justify their decision. It's a bit of a gray area, but since the author isn't legally bound and the family's expectations were unrealistic given the situation, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue they should have given gifts to maintain family harmony, so A could be a case too. But given the mom's actions and the author's perspective, B seems more likely.\n"
