I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for refusing to buy family members Christmas gifts. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author received a $400 Target gift card. They shared this on Instagram, which their sister saw. The sister called to ask about it, and the author specifically told her not to tell their mom. Then, the mom found out anyway and insisted the author buy gifts for the sister and others. The author was frustrated because the mom added more people (cousins) to the list, even though they don't see them often. The author decided to keep the money for themselves instead, leading to a conflict with the mom.\n\nNow, considering the context: The author is 15, so they might not have a lot of money or experience with managing it. The mom's behavior seems to be pressuring the author to give gifts to relatives they don't see much, which might not be necessary. The author felt that the mom was greedy and wanted to take control of their money, which led to the refusal.\n\nLegally, the author owns the gift card, so they have the right to spend it as they see fit. However, family dynamics and expectations can complicate things. The author was clear about their discomfort with the added pressure. The mom's reaction might be seen as overstepping by not respecting the author's wishes once they said no.\n\nBut maybe the author should have communicated better? They did say \"No thanks\" and then bought gifts for a friend and themselves. However, the mom might have expected some family gifts regardless. The question is whether the author's refusal was justified given the circumstances.\n\nThe key points are: the author's right to their own money, the mom's pressure, and the age of the author. Since the author is a minor, their parents might expect some responsibility, but the mom's actions here were more about adding pressure without consent. The author's decision to stop the gifts because of the mom's behavior could be seen as a reaction to being pushed into spending on unnecessary items.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's situational. The author isn't in the wrong because they had the right to use their money as they chose, especially after being pressured. The mom overstepped by not respecting the author's decision once they said no. However, the author could have handled the communication differently, but the main issue is the mom's greed and lack of respect for their wishes.\n\nSo the answer would be B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
