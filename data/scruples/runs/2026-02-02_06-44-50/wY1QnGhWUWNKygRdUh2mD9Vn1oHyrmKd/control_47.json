I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (a 15-year-old) is in the wrong for refusing to buy Christmas gifts for their family members after receiving a $400 gift card.\n\nFirst, the context: The author won a gift card, told their sister, who then called the author. The mother found out and insisted the author get gifts for the sister and then added two more cousins. The author felt pressured and decided to keep the money for themselves instead. The mom was upset and argued with the author.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the perspectives. \n\nFrom the author's side: They are 15, which is a minor, and might have limited financial experience. They won the gift card, which is their own money. The mother and family members kept adding more people to get gifts for, which the author found obnoxious. The author felt that the family was being greedy, especially since the cousins are young and aren't seen often. The author used the money for personal needs and a friend, which might be seen as reasonable since they are spending their own money.\n\nFrom the family's perspective: The mother might expect that if a child receives a gift, they should share with family, especially if the child was the one who initially shared the gift card info. The mother's insistence could stem from wanting the child to practice generosity or family traditions. The fact that the author initially agreed to get gifts and then changed their mind mid-shopping might have caused frustration.\n\nLegally, the gift card is the author's to spend as they wish, so they're not required to give gifts. However, family expectations and cultural norms play a role. In many cultures, especially in families, there's an expectation to give gifts during holidays. The author's age is a factor; a 15-year-old might have a different view on money and family obligations compared to an adult. The argument about the cousins being young and not seen often is a valid point for the author's perspective\u2014they might not feel a strong connection or obligation.\n\nThe key points: The author's autonomy with their money versus family expectations. The mother's actions might be seen as overstepping, especially if she pressured the child to use the gift card for others without considering the child's feelings. The author's frustration with the added pressure could justify their decision to keep the money. However, refusing to give gifts at all might be seen as inconsiderate by family, especially if it's a tradition.\n\nConsidering all this, there's no clear right or wrong. But the author's age and the fact that they are using their own money (even if it's a gift card) support their right to make that choice. The family's reaction might stem from not understanding the child's perspective. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
