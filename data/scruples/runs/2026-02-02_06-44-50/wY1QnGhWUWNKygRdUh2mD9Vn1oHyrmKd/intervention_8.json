I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not buying Christmas gifts for their family. Let me go through the details again.\n\nThe author is 15, which is a teenager, so maybe they have a different perspective. They got a $400 gift card and shared it on Instagram where their sister saw. The sister called, and the author told her not to tell their mom. But the mom found out anyway, probably from the sister. Then the mom pressured the author to buy gifts for the sister, and later the mom added cousins. The author felt it was too much, especially since the cousins are young and not close. They ended up spending the money on themselves and a friend, which upset the mom and led to an argument.\n\nSo, the key points are the author's decision not to buy gifts, the mom's pressure, and the resulting conflict. The author's reasoning is that the family members were being greedy and overstepping by asking for gifts after finding out about the money. The mom expected gifts but the author felt it was their money to spend as they wished.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms, in many families, there's an expectation to give gifts to close family during Christmas. However, the author is a minor, which complicates things because families might have different expectations. The mom's approach might have been heavy-handed, especially adding more people after the initial request. The author's frustration is understandable, especially since the cousins are young and not part of their regular life. \n\nBut from the mom's perspective, she might have felt that since the author had the money, it was appropriate to use it for family gifts. However, the author's money is their own, and they have the right to spend it how they want. The mom's reaction of guilt-tripping and yelling might have been harsh. The author's decision to set a boundary and not comply is valid if they felt it was their money and the requests were excessive. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not giving gifts if the requests were unreasonable and the family overstepped. However, the way the author handled it by cutting off communication and ignoring calls could have been done more respectfully. But considering the situation, the author's actions were a response to pressure. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have a right to their own money and the family's pressure was excessive. The author's decision to prioritize their own needs and set boundaries is reasonable, especially given their age and financial maturity.\n"
