I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not buying family gifts after getting a $400 Target gift card. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 15 years old. That's a teenager, so maybe they're learning about money management and family expectations. The gift card was won, and they shared it on Instagram. That might have led to their sister and mom finding out. The mom then told them they had to get gifts for the sister, cousins, etc. The author felt pressured, decided not to buy gifts, and spent the money on themselves instead. The mom was upset and guilt-tripped them.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. On one hand, the gift card was the author's money, and they have the right to spend it as they see fit. They might have felt the pressure from their family was unfair, especially for cousins they don't see often. Also, being 15, their perspective on gift-giving might be different. \n\nOn the other hand, in some families, there's an expectation that if you receive something, you should give back. The author might not have considered that their family might expect reciprocity. But the mom's reaction was obnoxious, adding pressure, which could have justified the author's frustration.\n\nThe key points are the author's right to their money, the mom's overstepping by making demands, and the age factor. The author's decision to stop buying gifts after being pressured could be seen as self-protective. However, not buying gifts for family might be seen as inconsiderate, but in this case, the author felt coerced. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author might not be in the wrong because they were managing their own money and reacting to pressure. The mom's behavior was more problematic. The answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
