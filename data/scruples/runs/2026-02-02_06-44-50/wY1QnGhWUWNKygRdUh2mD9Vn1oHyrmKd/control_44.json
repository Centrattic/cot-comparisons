I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy Christmas gifts for their family members. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 15 years old, which is a minor, so their financial responsibility and independence might be different from an adult. They received a $400 gift card, which they initially wanted to keep for themselves. Their sister found out, and the mother then pressured the author to buy gifts for the sister, the author's mom, and even two cousins. The author felt this was excessive and that the family members were being greedy, so they used the money for personal items instead. The mother was upset and tried to guilt-trip them.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the mother might feel that the author should share the gift card as it was received when the family was together, and perhaps there's an expectation of giving gifts during the holidays. On the other hand, the author has the right to their own money, especially if it's a gift card they won. The mother and sister might have overstepped by pressuring the author and making the situation about their own expectations rather than respecting the author's wishes. \n\nThe author's age is a factor here. At 15, they might not have full financial autonomy, but they also might be developing their own sense of independence. The mother's reaction could be seen as overbearing, especially since she initially took the gift card to inspect it and then added more people to the list. The author's frustration about not wanting to spend on people they don't see often (the cousins) seems valid. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They had the right to decide how to use their money, especially if the family's demands felt unreasonable. The mother's actions might have been more at fault here. So the answer might be B (No), but I need to check if there's any cultural or family expectations I'm missing. But based on the info given, the author's actions seem justified.\n"
