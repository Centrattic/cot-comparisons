I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy family members Christmas gifts. The author is 15, which is a teenager, so maybe that affects the context.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author won a $400 Target gift card and shared it on Instagram. His sister saw it and told their mom. The mom then pressured him to buy gifts for the sister, cousins, and maybe others. The author felt it was greedy and decided to spend the money on himself instead. Mom was upset and argued with him.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author mentions he's very conservative with money. He was pressured by his mom and sister to spend the gift card on family, but he didn't agree. He spent it on himself and a friend. Mom was upset and guilt-tripped him.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, family expectations can vary. In some cultures, it's customary to give gifts to family, especially during Christmas. However, the author didn't have to use the gift card for that. The gift card was won, not given by the mother. The mother's demand might be seen as overstepping, especially if the author didn't agree. \n\nThe author's age is 15, so maybe he's still learning about personal finance and family dynamics. The pressure from mom and sister to spend the money on them could be seen as taking advantage of the situation. The author's decision to prioritize his own needs and a friend's gift is valid, especially if he's managing his money. \n\nBut on the other hand, not giving gifts to immediate family might be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author had a reason to feel pressured. The mom's reaction might be harsh, but the author's response was to stand his ground, which is understandable.\n\nSo, considering the mother's overreach and the author's right to manage his own money, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the author wasn't obligated to use the gift card for family gifts, and the mom added pressure, the author might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
