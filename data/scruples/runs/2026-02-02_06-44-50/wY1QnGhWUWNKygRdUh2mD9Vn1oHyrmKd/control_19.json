I bragged about it on Instagram, where my sister follows me on, and of course, she saw it. She gave me a phone call and asked me who gave it to me, and I explain the situation, and tell her specifically NOT TO TELL MOM, as I knew it was bad enough that my sister knew already. She hangs up, and a few minutes later, my mother comes bursting into my room. She asks to see the gift card, and I hand it to her. She gives it back, then she says, obnoxiously, \u201cYou have to get something for me and (Sister\u2019s name), That frustrated me enough, but I agreed, (I am VERY conservative, especially with my money.) \n\nThen when I was at target, getting my stuff plus what I WAS gonna get for my mom and sister, I get a phone call from my mom. \n\nMom: \u201cOh, also, you have to get something for (Cousin 1\u2019s name) and (Cousin 2\u2019s name,) as well. Be thoughtful, don\u2019t just get something cheap.\u201d She said, even more obnoxiously \n\n(We were visiting my Uncle and Aunt for christmas, and my cousins are 6 and 2, so why the hell would I need to spend that much money on two more people I don\u2019t and won\u2019t see often?)\n\nMe: \u201cNo thanks.\u201d I then hung up the phone and ignored the rest of my mom\u2019s texts and phone calls.\n\nI spoiled myself, changing my mind about getting anyone else anything, because of how obnoxious everyone was being towards me after finding out what I had, so I spoiled myself. Bought myself a pair of airpods, GTA V, PlayStation Plus,a cheap laptop to do work on, and some new wrestling gear. Also bought a buddy of mine a bluetooth speaker, and spent the rest on candy and whatnot. \n\nWalked home and my mother was expecting that I got everyone a gift. Boy, was she shocked (despite our last phone call.) I got an ass chewing and she tried to guilt trip me, (unsuccessfully.) \n\nWe were arguing then I just said \u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t being so greedy about the situation, and kept your paws off of my money, I wouldn\u2019t have changed my mind about getting you guys something!\u201d (My exact words with some stuttering in it,) \n\nShe then yelled at me a final time, marched to her room, and slammed her door. \n\nTyping that first paragraph made my blood boil, and reminded me of why I\u2019m gonna keep all future assets private to me and me only. \n\nI\u2019m 15 years old, if that will affect your criticism at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to buy family members Christmas gifts. The situation involves a 15-year-old who won a $400 Target gift card. He shared it on Instagram, his sister found out, and then his mom got involved. The mom and sister started making demands for gifts, even adding cousins. The author then decided not to buy gifts and spent the money on himself instead. \n\nSo, first, I need to analyze the key points. The author is 15, which is a teenager. At that age, they might be developing their own sense of independence. The gift card was his, and he didn't want to share it because of how his family reacted. The family's behavior was pressuring him to spend money on others he doesn't see often (cousins 6 and 2 years old). \n\nThe author's main argument is that the family was greedy and overstepped by making demands after finding out about the gift card. He felt compelled to spend his money on others when he didn't want to. His mom even called it obnoxious, which adds to the pressure. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author has a right to his own money. The family's reaction might be seen as taking advantage of his situation. However, typical family expectations around Christmas might involve gift-giving, even if it's not mandatory. But since the author was pressured into it, maybe that's where the issue lies. \n\nAge is a factor here. At 15, he's still under his parents' care, so there might be expectations of contributing to family traditions. However, the way the family handled it was pushy and maybe disrespectful. The author's decision to prioritize his own needs isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If the family didn't explicitly ask him to buy gifts but he was pressured into it, then refusing isn't wrong. But if there was an unspoken expectation, maybe it's different. However, considering the aggressive behavior from the mother, the author's refusal seems justified. \n\nAlso, he did buy a gift for a friend, which shows he's not entirely against gift-giving. The problem was the family's demands. So, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
