She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a girl who is racist, specifically against Black people. The author is in Europe, and the girlfriend is Ukrainian. He mentions that racism might be more common in Eastern Europe, citing his dad's experiences. He's trying to get her to stop being racist but faces pressure from a friend who's Black and an ultimatum to choose between the friend and the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether the author is at fault. The girlfriend's racism is a problem. The author is in a relationship with her, which could be seen as supporting her views, even if he's trying to change her. But is that his responsibility? Also, his friend is upset, which adds to the conflict. The author is trying to balance both relationships but is being forced into an ultimatum. \n\nThe key points here are the girlfriend's racist behavior, the author's awareness of it, and his attempts to address it. The question is whether the author is at fault. If someone is in a relationship with a racist person, are they complicit? It's a gray area. The author isn't necessarily the one being racist, but by staying with her, he might be enabling her views. However, changing someone's views is challenging, and the author is making efforts. \n\nThe friend's ultimatum complicates things. The author is caught between two relationships. The friend feels betrayed, which is valid because the girlfriend's racism could affect their friendship. But does the author have a duty to end the relationship to protect the friendship? Or is the friend overstepping by making an ultimatum? \n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, he's not the racist one, but he's choosing to stay with someone who is. That could be seen as problematic because he's not taking a clear stand against racism. However, the author is actively trying to change her, which shows he's not supportive of the racism. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the girlfriend is racist, and he's aware, but continues the relationship, he might be indirectly complicit. But he's making efforts to address it. The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but the author's choice to stay with the girlfriend despite her views could be seen as prioritizing his relationship over standing against racism. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes) because by choosing to be in a relationship with someone who is racist, even if he's trying to change her, he's in a position where he's not actively opposing racism. The friend's reaction is an external factor, but the core issue is the author's relationship with a racist person. However, it's a nuanced situation. But according to the question, the options are A or B. Given that, the author is in the wrong for not taking a stronger stand against racism, even if he's trying to address it. So answer A.\n"
