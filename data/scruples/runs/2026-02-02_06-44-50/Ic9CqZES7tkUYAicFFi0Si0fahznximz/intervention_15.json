She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. Let me break this down. The author is dating a Ukrainian girl who has racist views against Black people. He mentions that it's a cultural thing in Eastern Europe, and he's trying to change her. His friend, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. Racism is a serious issue. Even if the author believes it's cultural, that doesn't excuse it. The fact that the girlfriend makes negative comments about Black people and refuses to go to Africa (Kenya) is harmful. The author is defending her by saying it's cultural and that changing someone's racism is hard. But just because it's common in a culture doesn't mean it's acceptable.\n\nThe author is being pressured by a close Black friend to choose between the relationship and the friendship. The friend's frustration is valid because racism affects real people and perpetuates inequality. The author might think he's not doing anything wrong by dating her, but he's enabling her racism by not taking a stand. \n\nBy not confronting her behavior or ending the relationship, he's complicit. Even if he's trying to change her, his continued presence might not be enough. The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but the author's situation is problematic because he's choosing to overlook her harmful views. \n\nSo, the answer here would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's supporting a racist partner and not taking the necessary steps to address the issue, which harms others and perpetuates racism.\n"
