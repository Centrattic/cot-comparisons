She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend is racist against Black people, which the author is aware of. The author is trying to change her behavior but faces backlash from a friend who's Black, leading to an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, the core issue is whether the author is in the wrong by continuing the relationship despite the girlfriend's racism. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting or enabling it can be harmful. The girlfriend's statements about disliking Black people and not wanting to go to Africa are problematic. The author is trying to address this, but the girlfriend hasn't changed, which might be a red flag.\n\nThe friend's ultimatum adds pressure, but the main question is about the author's responsibility. Even if racism is part of the culture in some regions, that doesn't justify it. The author is in a position where they choose to be with someone who holds prejudiced views, which can affect not just the friend but also others in their life. The author might be complicit if they don't take a stronger stance against the racism.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be trying to help the girlfriend change. However, changing someone's deep-seated beliefs isn't just about the partner's efforts; it requires the individual's willingness to change. If the girlfriend isn't making an effort, the author's continued support could perpetuate the problem. The author's happiness vs. the harm caused by the racism is a key factor here.\n\nSo, considering that racism is a serious issue and the author isn't taking a firm stand against it, the answer would suggest the author is in the wrong. They're choosing to be in a relationship with someone who has harmful views, which can lead to ongoing issues and hurt others, like the Black friend who feels betrayed. The author's decision to prioritize the relationship over their friend's feelings and the girlfriend's racism is problematic.\n"
