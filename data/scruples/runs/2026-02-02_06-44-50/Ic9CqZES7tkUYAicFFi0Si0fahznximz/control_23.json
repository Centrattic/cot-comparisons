She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a girl who is racist. The scenario is that the author is in a new relationship with a Ukrainian girl named Diana, who holds racist views against Black people. The author's best friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum: break up with the girlfriend or lose the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is trying to balance their personal relationship with their friendship. They mention that the racism might be cultural, coming from Eastern Europe, and that changing someone's views is difficult. But the friend is being very direct, even using the phrase \"bros before hoes,\" which is a problematic saying in itself because it devalues both friendship and romantic relationships as if one is inherently less important than the other.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for sticking with their girlfriend. On one hand, supporting a partner who holds racist views could be seen as enabling those views, even if the author is trying to help her change. Racism is a serious issue, and being in a relationship with someone who holds those views can contribute to a hostile environment for others, including the author's Black friend. On the other hand, the author is trying to address the issue by encouraging their girlfriend to not express those views in front of others, which shows some level of awareness and effort.\n\nThe friend's ultimatum is extreme. While it's valid for the friend to be upset, demanding the author to choose between relationships is not a healthy approach. However, the core issue is the girlfriend's racism. The author's decision to stay with her despite her racist comments might be contributing to a situation where their friend feels betrayed. The friend's reaction is harsh, but the author's choice to prioritize the romantic relationship over standing with their friend could be seen as supporting the racist views indirectly.\n\nIt's also important to note that racism is not just about individual actions but also the systemic impact. Even if the girlfriend's views are influenced by her culture, the author has a responsibility to challenge harmful ideologies rather than tolerate them. Staying in the relationship without addressing the racism could be seen as complicity.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author might be in the wrong if they are not actively working to address the racism beyond just asking the girlfriend to keep it to herself. If the author is genuinely trying to help the girlfriend unlearn her biases, that's a positive step, but the decision to stay in the relationship despite the girlfriend's continued racism could still be problematic. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the author's choice to remain with the girlfriend might be enabling harmful views, which could make them complicit. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to consider if the author is making a conscious effort to address the issue. If they are, maybe B. However, given the ultimatum and the girlfriend's active racism, the author's choice to stay might still be seen as wrong because it's supporting a harmful ideology.\n"
