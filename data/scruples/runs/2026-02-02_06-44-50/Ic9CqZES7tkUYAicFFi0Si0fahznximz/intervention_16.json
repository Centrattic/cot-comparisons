She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation involves a person who's in a new relationship with a Ukrainian girl who has racist views against Black people. The author is caught between his girlfriend's racism and his friendship with a Black friend who's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting someone who holds racist views, even if it's not extreme, can be problematic. The author is aware of her racism but chooses to date her anyway. That might mean he's enabling or at least condoning her views, even if he's trying to change her. \n\nThe friend's reaction is strong, giving an ultimatum: girlfriend or friendship. The author is trying to mediate, but the friend feels betrayed. The question is whether the author is wrong for continuing the relationship despite knowing her racism. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, being in a relationship with someone who is racist could be seen as complicit, especially if the author doesn't actively challenge those views. The fact that he's trying to change her might mitigate some blame, but just trying isn't enough if he's still choosing to be with her. \n\nAlso, the cultural context is mentioned, implying it's a cultural issue in Eastern Europe. But that doesn't excuse racism. The author might be justifying her behavior as cultural, but that's not a valid reason to tolerate prejudice. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author isn't directly participating in the racism and is working to address it, maybe he's not entirely at fault. However, the core issue is that he's choosing to be with someone who has racist views, which can harm others and perpetuate discrimination. \n\nThe friend's ultimatum is harsh, but the author's decision affects both people. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining the relationship despite knowing her racism. If he's not taking a firm stand against her views, even if he's trying to change her, he might be complicit. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong because he's choosing to be in a relationship with a racist person without making it clear that her views are unacceptable. Even if he's trying to change her, it's his responsibility to reject racism, not just tolerate it.\n"
