She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The key points here are the girlfriend's racism, the cultural context in Eastern Europe, and the conflict with the author's friend.\n\nFirst, racism is a serious issue. The girlfriend's dislike of Black people and her comments about Africa are problematic. Being racist is not acceptable, regardless of cultural background. The author acknowledges this but seems to downplay it by attributing it to culture. However, justifying racism as a cultural norm doesn't make it right. Everyone has a responsibility to stand against prejudice.\n\nThe author is caught between two important relationships: his girlfriend and his friend. The friend, who is Black, feels betrayed and is giving an ultimatum. The author's position is that he's not betraying his friend by dating the girlfriend, but his friend disagrees. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is a controversial one, often used to prioritize friendships over romantic partners, but it's a simplistic approach to a complex issue.\n\nThe author is trying to change the girlfriend's behavior, which is commendable, but if she's not willing to change or acknowledge her racism, the author might be complicit by staying with her despite her views. Being in a relationship with someone who holds racist beliefs can be hurtful to others and can enable harmful attitudes. The author's friend has the right to feel hurt and to set boundaries, especially since the girlfriend's racism directly affects him.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's not the one being racist, but by staying with the girlfriend, he's choosing to support someone who has harmful views, which can be seen as complicity. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the author's choice to prioritize the relationship over his friend's feelings could be seen as a betrayal, especially since his friend is a long-time, close companion. The author should consider that supporting a partner's racist behavior can damage other relationships and perpetuate prejudice. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's enabling the girlfriend's racism and not taking a firm stand against it, which harms his friend and perpetuates harmful attitudes.\n"
