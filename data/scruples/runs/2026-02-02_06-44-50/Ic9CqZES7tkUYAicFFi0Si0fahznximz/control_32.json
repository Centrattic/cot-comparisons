She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation involves a Ukrainian girl who has racist views against Black people, which the author is trying to address. The author's friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's perspective. He's been close for three years, and the girlfriend's racism affects him directly. The friend's reaction is understandable because experiencing racism can be hurtful. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is problematic because it trivializes the issue and puts the author in a difficult position. However, the friend's stance is that the author shouldn't support someone who is racist against him.\n\nOn the other hand, the author likes the girlfriend and is trying to change her views. The author mentions that racism in Eastern Europe might be culturally ingrained, making it hard to change. But the key point is that the girlfriend is making racist comments, which are harmful regardless of cultural background. The author is defending the girlfriend's behavior, which could be seen as enabling it.\n\nThe author's responsibility here is complex. While they might not be responsible for her racism, they are complicit by not addressing it adequately. The friend is right to feel betrayed because dating someone who is racist towards him is a significant issue. The author needs to recognize that supporting a partner's racism, even if trying to change them, can be harmful. \n\nIn the end, the author is in a tough spot, but their choice to stay with the girlfriend despite the racist behavior could be seen as wrong because it prioritizes the relationship over standing against racism, especially when it affects a close friend.\n"
