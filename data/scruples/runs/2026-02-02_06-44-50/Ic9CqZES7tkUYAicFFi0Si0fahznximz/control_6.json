She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation involves the girlfriend being racist against Black people, which the author is trying to address. The author's friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's racism is a significant issue. Even if it's culturally influenced, racism is a serious problem. The author is trying to help her change, but the girlfriend's actions (like expressing dislike for Black people and not wanting to go to Africa) are harmful. The friend's reaction is strong, but the author is caught between two people.\n\nThe key points here are the girlfriend's racism and the author's responsibility. If the author is aware of her racism and continues the relationship, especially when it's causing harm to others, there's an argument that the author is complicit, even if they're trying to help. However, if the author is genuinely trying to support the girlfriend in changing her views, that's a different angle. But the girlfriend's actions are offensive, and the author is in a position where they might be enabling the racism by staying with her.\n\nThe friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the fact that the girlfriend's racism is directed at his friend adds another layer. The author might be in a difficult spot, but the question is whether they are wrong for choosing to stay with the girlfriend. The answer likely depends on whether the author is ignoring the racism or actively working to address it. If the author is doing the latter, maybe they're not wrong, but if they're excusing or downplaying her racism, they are.\n\nThe user's friend is a Black man from Kenya, so the racism is directly affecting him. The author's decision to continue the relationship despite this could be seen as prioritizing the girlfriend over a friend, which might make the author wrong. However, the friend's ultimatum is also problematic because friendships shouldn't be about choosing sides over issues like racism. The author might be in a tough spot where both parties are making extreme demands, but the root issue is the girlfriend's racism, which the author has a responsibility to address.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might be good, staying in a relationship with someone who holds racist views, especially when it's harming others, could be seen as being in the wrong. The author has a moral obligation to stand against racism, even if it's a cultural issue. Choosing to support the girlfriend over the friend in this case might perpetuate the racism, making the author complicit.\n"
