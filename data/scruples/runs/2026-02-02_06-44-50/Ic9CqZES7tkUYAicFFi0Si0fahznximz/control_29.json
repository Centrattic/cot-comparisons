She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about dating a girlfriend who's racist, and facing an ultimatum from a friend because of it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The person is dating Diana, who is described as racist towards Black people. The person is trying to get her to stop being racist, but some of their friends, including a Black friend, are upset. The friend is demanding the person choose between the girlfriend and the friendship, using the \"bros before hoes\" argument. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by sticking with their girlfriend despite her racism.\n\nSo, the main issue here is balancing relationships and addressing racism. The user is in a tough spot because they like their girlfriend a lot but her racism is causing conflict. On one hand, supporting a racist partner can be problematic, as racism is a serious issue. On the other hand, they might be trying to work on her behavior, which is a valid approach. However, the friend is making an ultimatum, which complicates things.\n\nThe user's argument is that it's a cultural issue common in Eastern Europe, and they're trying to help their girlfriend. But racism isn't just a cultural thing; it's harmful and perpetuates discrimination. The girlfriend's actions, like not liking Black people and not wanting to go to Africa, are clear examples of racism. The user's friend is right to be upset because dating someone who holds these views can be hurtful to marginalized groups.\n\nThe user is caught between their love for their girlfriend and their friendship. But the friend isn't wrong in feeling betrayed because the user didn't take their racism seriously enough. The user's friend is prioritizing the friendship over the user's relationship, which is a common stance, but that doesn't make the user right or wrong.\n\nI need to consider if the user is in the wrong by choosing to stay with their racist girlfriend despite the consequences. The user is trying to address her racism, which is a positive step, but just trying isn't enough. Active change requires consistent effort, and if the girlfriend isn't willing to change, the user's continued support could enable her racism. The user's friend has valid concerns because the Black friend is directly affected by the racism.\n\nIn conclusion, the user is in a difficult situation, but choosing to stay with a racist partner despite the harm caused can be seen as supporting that racism. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong because they're not taking a firm stance against their girlfriend's racism, even if they're trying to help. The ultimatum from the friend is harsh, but the user's actions still have consequences for the Black friend.\n"
