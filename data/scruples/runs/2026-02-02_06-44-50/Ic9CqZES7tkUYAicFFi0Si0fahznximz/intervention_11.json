She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation involves a guy who really likes his new girlfriend, Diana, but she has racist views towards black people. He's trying to get her to change, but his friend, who is black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's right and wrong here. The guy isn't directly being racist himself, but he's in a relationship with someone who is. The question is whether that makes him complicit or in the wrong. The friend is upset because the girlfriend's racism is offensive, especially given his background. The guy is trying to change her views, which is commendable, but the friend feels betrayed and is demanding a choice between the relationship and the friendship.\n\nI should think about the impact of the girlfriend's racism. Even if it's cultural, saying she doesn't like black people and doesn't want to go to Africa is harmful. The friend, being Kenyan, is directly affected by her comments. The guy's stance is that he's not responsible for her past or cultural context, but he's choosing to stay with her despite her harmful views. \n\nIs it wrong to date someone with racist views? It depends on the individual's actions. If he's actively trying to address the issue, maybe he's not entirely at fault. However, by staying with her, he might be normalizing those views and not holding her accountable. The friend's reaction is about feeling betrayed, which is a valid concern if the guy isn't taking the racism seriously enough. \n\nThe key points are: the guy isn't the one being racist, but he's in a relationship with someone who is. His friend is a direct victim of the racism. The guy is trying to change her, but the friend feels he's not doing enough. The ultimatum is harsh, but the friend has a right to be upset. \n\nSo, is the guy in the wrong? He's not the one making the racist comments, but by continuing to date her despite knowing the harm her views cause, he might be enabling her behavior. If he truly values his friend's feelings and the impact of racism, he might need to reconsider his relationship. But if he's actively working to change her views and the friend isn't giving him time, then maybe it's the friend who's being unreasonable. \n\nHmm, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's aware of the racism and continues the relationship without addressing it effectively, he could be complicit. However, he's trying to help her change. The answer might depend on whether his actions are sufficient. Since the friend is directly affected and the girlfriend's comments are offensive, the guy's choice to stay could be seen as wrong, especially if he's not taking the issue seriously enough.\n"
