She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about him dating a Ukrainian girl who's racist against Black people, and his friend is giving him an ultimatum to choose between the girlfriend or the friendship.\n\nFirst, the author likes his girlfriend and acknowledges her positive traits. He's aware of her racism but thinks it's a cultural thing. However, he's trying to change her behavior by asking her not to be racist in front of friends and family. But his friend, who is Black, is upset and demanding he break up with her or lose the friendship. The friend says \"bros before hoes,\" which is a phrase that often prioritizes male friendship over romantic relationships, but it's controversial because it can be seen as devaluing women.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girlfriend's racism, the author's stance on it, and the ultimatum from the friend. The author is defending his choice to stay with his girlfriend despite her racism, arguing it's a cultural issue and that changing someone's views is hard. \n\nBut is it wrong for him to continue the relationship? Well, racism is a serious issue. Even if it's cultural, choosing to be in a relationship with someone who holds racist views can be problematic, especially if those views are directed at people he's close to. The friend's reaction is strong, but the author is in a position where he might be enabling or not taking the racism seriously enough. \n\nThe author mentions that the girlfriend's racist comments include not liking Black people and not wanting to go to Africa. The fact that she makes such statements, even if she's not violent about it, is still harmful. The author's friend, who is Kenyan, is directly affected by these views. By not ending the relationship, the author might be showing that he's okay with his girlfriend having these prejudices, which could hurt his friend and others. \n\nThe author is trying to \"cure\" her racism, but that's not really how it works. People can't be \"fixed\" through a relationship, especially if they're not open to self-reflection. The author should consider whether he can accept someone's racism as part of who they are. Also, the friend's ultimatum is extreme, but it's a valid response to being told to choose between his racism and the friendship. \n\nIn this case, the author is in a tough spot, but the fact remains that supporting someone with racist views, even if he's trying to change them, can be harmful. The friend's anger is justified because the author is in a relationship with someone who holds prejudices against him. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is problematic, but the core issue is the racism. The author might be in the wrong for not taking his friend's feelings seriously and for not recognizing that his choice to stay with his girlfriend could be seen as a betrayal of his friend's dignity and well-being.\n"
