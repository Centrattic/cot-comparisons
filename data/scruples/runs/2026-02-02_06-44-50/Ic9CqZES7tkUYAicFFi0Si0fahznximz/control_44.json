She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is in a new relationship with Diana, who has racist views against Black people. The author mentions that racism is more culturally accepted in Eastern Europe, which is where Diana is from. The author is trying to address the racism by asking her to stop making such comments, especially in front of friends and family. However, a close Black friend of the author is upset and giving an ultimatum: end the relationship or the friendship.\n\nSo, the main points to consider are:\n1. Is the author responsible for their girlfriend's racism?\n2. Is the author at fault for continuing the relationship despite the racism?\n3. How does the cultural context affect this?\n\nThe author argues that changing someone's racist views is difficult and a cultural issue. They're trying to work on it but are facing pressure from a friend. The author's friend feels betrayed because the girlfriend's racism is a problem for him as a Black person. The author is caught between two important relationships.\n\nNow, in terms of responsibility: The author isn't the one being racist, so they aren't directly at fault. However, by choosing to stay in a relationship with someone who holds racist views, especially when it's causing harm to others, there might be some ethical considerations. The author could be seen as enabling the racism if they don't take a stronger stance.\n\nBut then again, the author is making an effort to address the issue. They're trying to change the behavior, which is a positive step. The friend's reaction is extreme, using \"bros before hoes,\" which isn't a healthy approach either. The key question is whether the author is in the wrong for not ending the relationship despite knowing the girlfriend's racism. \n\nCultural context complicates things. If the author is aware that the racism is culturally ingrained, they might be trying to help Diana overcome it. However, if the racism is affecting others negatively (as it is for the friend and his family), the author's choice to stay could be seen as prioritizing the relationship over standing against racism. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't directly racist, they might be enabling harmful behavior by not taking a firm stance. However, the answer isn't black and white because the situation involves cultural factors and the author's efforts to address the issue. The friend's ultimatum is also problematic. The author isn't in the wrong solely for being with a racist person if they're actively trying to address it, but there's a moral gray area here.\n"
