She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The author mentions that his girlfriend, Diana, is racist against Black people, and he's trying to change her behavior. His friend, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum to choose between the friend or the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend's racism is a problem, especially since the author has a close Black friend who feels betrayed. The author is in a conflict between his relationship and his friendship. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to address his girlfriend's racism, which is a good step. But does that justify continuing the relationship despite her racist views? Racism is a serious issue, and supporting someone with such views can be harmful, even if the person is otherwise good. The fact that the girlfriend is from Eastern Europe might be part of her upbringing, but that doesn't excuse the behavior. \n\nThe author's friend is making an ultimatum, which is harsh, but his feelings are valid given the racism. The author is caught in the middle, but staying with the girlfriend while she's expressing racist views could be seen as enabling that behavior. The author might be in denial about the severity of the issue, thinking it's a cultural thing that can be \"cured,\" but changing someone's racist attitudes isn't just about effort; it requires a willingness from both sides. If the girlfriend isn't making progress, the author might be complicit by staying.\n\nAlso, the fact that the girlfriend expressed dislike for Black people and Africa is a direct racial slur. The author's friend feeling betrayed is understandable. The author might be prioritizing the girlfriend over the friend's well-being, which could mean he's in the wrong by not taking a stand against racism.\n\nHowever, the author is in a new relationship and is clearly trying to address the issue. But relationships shouldn't tolerate harmful ideologies like racism. The author's responsibility to his friend and to not perpetuate racism might mean he's in the wrong by not ending the relationship despite the girlfriend's behavior.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he's staying in a relationship with someone who has racist views, which harms others and betrays his friend's trust. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
