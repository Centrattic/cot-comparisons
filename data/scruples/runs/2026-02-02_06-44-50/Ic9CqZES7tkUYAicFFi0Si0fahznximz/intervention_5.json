She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The author is in Europe, dating a Ukrainian woman named Diana for a week. He likes her a lot but she's racist against Black people. He's trying to get her to stop being racist, especially around his friends and family. One of his friends, who is Kenyan, is upset and giving him an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Racism is a serious issue, and being complicit in it, even if you're trying to change someone, can be problematic. The author is in a relationship with someone who holds racist views, and he's aware that these views are offensive to his friend. By continuing the relationship despite knowing the impact on others, he might be enabling her behavior. \n\nThe key points to consider: Is the author responsible for his girlfriend's racism? Well, he can't control her views entirely, but he can choose to be in a relationship with someone who holds those views. By doing so, he's associating with her and possibly condoning her behavior, even if he's trying to change her. His friend feels betrayed because the author is prioritizing the relationship over the friendship. The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but the author's decision to continue the relationship might be seen as a betrayal from his friend's perspective.\n\nHowever, the author is also trying to address the issue, which shows some level of concern. The challenge is whether his actions align with his values. If he genuinely opposes racism, being in a relationship with a racist person, even if he's trying to change her, might conflict with his own values. On the other hand, he's in a new relationship and might feel conflicted between his feelings for her and his moral stance.\n\nAlso, cultural context is mentioned\u2014Eastern European countries might have different social attitudes, but that doesn't excuse racism. Cultural norms shouldn't be an excuse for prejudice. The author might be rationalizing her behavior by cultural differences, which could be a way to justify staying with her despite the racism.\n\nAnother angle: the author is being pressured by his friend to end the relationship. The friend feels that supporting a racist partner is a betrayal. The author's response of trying to change her might not be sufficient for his friend. The question is whether the author is wrong for not ending the relationship, even if he's trying to address the racism. If the author truly believes that racism is wrong, then continuing the relationship despite her views could be seen as wrong because he's not taking a firm stand.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author is making an effort to address the racism, the act of being in a relationship with someone who holds racist views and not ending it when it's causing harm to others might place him in the wrong. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's enabling the racist behavior by staying with her and not taking a stronger stance, even if he's trying to change her.\n"
