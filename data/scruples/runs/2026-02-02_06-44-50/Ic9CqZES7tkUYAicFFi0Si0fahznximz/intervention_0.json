She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The author is facing a dilemma between his girlfriend and a close friend who is black.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's racism is the main issue here. The user mentions that she's racist against Black people, which is a serious matter. The friend is upset because the author is dating someone with racist views, which the friend feels is a betrayal. The friend is giving an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend and the friendship. The author is trying to mediate, but the friend isn't backing down.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. Racism is a harmful and deeply problematic issue. The girlfriend's racist statements, even if she's from a region where such views might be more common, can't be excused or justified. The author's friend is standing up against racism, which is a positive stance. The author, however, is in a position where he's choosing to continue the relationship despite knowing about her racist views. \n\nThe author argues that changing someone's racism is hard and that it's a cultural issue. But that doesn't absolve him of responsibility. By choosing to be in a relationship with someone who holds racist beliefs, especially when those beliefs affect others (like his Black friend), he may be enabling or tolerating that behavior. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is understandable. He feels betrayed because the author is prioritizing the girlfriend over standing up against racism. The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but his stance against racism is valid. The author is caught between two friends, but his choice to continue the relationship might be seen as supporting the girlfriend's harmful views.\n\nHowever, the author isn't outright violent or abusive; he's trying to address the issue. But the fact remains that he's choosing to stay with someone who has racist tendencies, which could lead to ongoing conflict and harm. \n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, it's a matter of perspective. Some might argue that he's caught in a difficult situation and is trying to handle it. Others might say that by not breaking off the relationship, he's complicit in the racism. The key point is that the author is aware of the racism and is choosing to ignore or downplay it, which could be seen as wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not taking a stand against racism. But I need to make sure I'm not overlooking any nuances. The girlfriend might not be an open racist, just has some prejudices. The author might be trying to change her. But even so, being in a relationship with someone who has racist views, especially when it affects others around you, is a problem. The answer hinges on the idea that supporting or tolerating racism is a form of being wrong.\n"
