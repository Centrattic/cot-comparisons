She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the question is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The scenario involves a guy from Europe who's in a new relationship with a Ukrainian woman named Diana. He likes her a lot but is troubled by her racist views against Black people. His friend, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend and the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Supporting racism is generally considered wrong, so if the girlfriend is racist, the author's choice to continue the relationship might be seen as condoning or enabling that behavior. However, the author is trying to address her racism, which shows some effort to change her views. But is that enough?\n\nThe friend who is Black is hurt and feels betrayed, which is valid because racism is a serious issue. The friend's stance of \"bros before hoes\" is a problematic phrase because it trivializes the depth of both relationships but highlights the conflict between personal loyalty and moral values.\n\nCultural context is mentioned\u2014Eastern Europe has a history of racism and xenophobia. However, that doesn't excuse racism. The author's argument that it's a cultural issue might not justify continuing a relationship where racism is present. The question is whether it's acceptable to overlook someone's racism because of cultural background.\n\nThe author's responsibility: Even if the racism is cultural, as a partner, he has a duty to advocate against it. Allowing racist behavior to continue could be seen as complicity. The friend's ultimatum adds pressure, but the author's decision should prioritize what's right over avoiding conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not be directly responsible for her racism. However, by choosing to stay with her despite her racist views, he's in a position where he might be enabling it. The fact that she's made specific derogatory comments (disliking Black people, not wanting to go to Africa) is a red flag. Her actions affect others, especially the Black friend.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he values equality and anti-racism, then staying in the relationship might make him complicit. The friend's reaction, while harsh, is a response to the author's potential complicity. The author's choice to stick with the girlfriend could be seen as prioritizing his personal relationship over his friend's well-being and the fight against racism.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision to continue the relationship despite her racism might make him complicit, hence he could be in the wrong. But the situation is complex. However, supporting racism in any form is ethically problematic, so the answer leans towards A (yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
