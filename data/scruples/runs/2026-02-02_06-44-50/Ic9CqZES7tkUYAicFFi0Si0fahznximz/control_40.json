She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The scenario is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post where the person is caught between their girlfriend who holds racist views and a friend (a black Kenyan) who's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is dating Diana, who is racist towards black people. They mention that it's possibly a cultural issue common in Eastern Europe. The author is trying to get her to stop being racist around friends and family. However, a close black friend is upset and gives an ultimatum: break up with the girlfriend or lose the friendship. The author is conflicted and doesn't want to make a choice, but the friend is being very firm.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's racism is a direct issue. The author is aware of her racism and is trying to address it, but it's not clear if they've been successful. The friend's reaction is understandable given the personal offense, but the ultimatum might be extreme.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is wrong for choosing to stay with the girlfriend. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nRacism is a serious issue, and being in a relationship with someone who holds these views could be problematic. However, the author is trying to change her, which shows some effort. But does that effort justify staying in the relationship if the racism isn't changing? Also, the friend's perspective is valid because being called racist is hurtful. The author's friend feels betrayed, which adds to the complexity.\n\nI need to consider if the author's choice to prioritize the girlfriend over the friend makes them the asshole. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is a problematic attitude in itself, suggesting that friendships are less important than romantic relationships, which isn't necessarily fair. However, the friend's hurt feelings are real. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is complicit in racism by not leaving the relationship despite knowing the girlfriend's views. If the racism isn't being addressed effectively, staying could be seen as enabling it. On the other hand, changing someone's deep-seated beliefs is difficult. But there's a responsibility to not support or promote racism, even if it's part of a cultural norm.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong if they are knowingly supporting someone with racist views, especially when it's causing direct harm to a friend. The fact that they haven't been able to change her behavior after some effort doesn't excuse staying in the relationship. Supporting racism, even culturally, is not acceptable, so the author could be seen as enabling it by continuing the relationship.\n"
