She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation involves a Ukrainian girl with racist views against Black people. The author is trying to change her behavior but faces pressure from a friend who gives an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting or enabling racist behavior can be problematic. The author might be in a morally gray area because they're trying to address the issue but are still in a relationship with someone who holds racist views. However, the question is whether they are wrong for continuing the relationship despite her racism.\n\nThe friend's ultimatum (\"bros before hoes\") adds complexity. The friend feels betrayed because the author is dating someone with racist views, which the friend perceives as a betrayal. The author is caught between their relationship and their friendship. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author is complicit in the racism. If they are actively trying to help their girlfriend change her views, does that mitigate responsibility? Or is the mere act of being in a relationship with someone racist enough to make them \"in the wrong\"?\n\nAlso, the author mentions that racism might be cultural in Eastern Europe. While that's a factor, it doesn't excuse racist behavior. The author should ideally encourage their partner to reflect on her views and understand that racism is wrong regardless of cultural context. However, the author's role in this situation is to either work on changing her views or consider the impact of their relationship on others, especially when it affects their friendships.\n\nIn the end, staying in a relationship with someone who is racist can contribute to the normalization of those views. The author might not be directly racist themselves, but by choosing to remain with someone who holds such views, they could be seen as complicit, especially if they don't take a clear stance against it. The friend's reaction is about feeling that the author is prioritizing the relationship over their friendship, which is a valid concern. However, the friend's approach with an ultimatum is also problematic, as it's not productive to force someone to choose between relationships.\n\nSo, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for being in the relationship, especially if they're actively trying to address the racism. But they could be in the wrong if they are not taking sufficient steps to challenge or change the behavior, or if they are ignoring the hurt caused to others. The answer hinges on whether the author is genuinely making efforts to address the issue or if they are passively accepting it. Given the details, the author is trying to help the girlfriend, but it's still a complex situation where they might share some responsibility for not distancing themselves more clearly from the racism.\n"
