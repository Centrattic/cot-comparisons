She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about dating a girlfriend who's racist against Black people, and a friend who's threatening to end the friendship if the person doesn't stop dating her.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girlfriend is described as racist, specifically against Black people. The person is trying to address this by encouraging her to not be racist, but the friend is upset and giving an ultimatum. The user wants to know if the author is wrong for choosing to stick with the girlfriend despite her racism.\n\nSo, the main ethical issue here is whether it's acceptable to remain in a relationship with someone who holds racist views. Racism is a serious and harmful issue. While the girlfriend's behavior is described as not overtly aggressive (just saying she doesn't like Black people and wouldn't want to go to Africa), it's still a form of prejudice. The person in the story is aware of this and is trying to address it, but the friend feels betrayed. \n\nNow, considering the options: Answer A says the author is in the wrong, B says they're not. The friend's ultimatum is \"bros before hoes,\" which is a problematic phrase because it implies that friendships are more important than a romantic relationship, but it's also a bit of a clich\u00e9 and doesn't address the underlying issue of racism. However, the friend's argument is that dating someone who is racist is a betrayal, which is a valid concern because supporting a racist person can perpetuate harmful attitudes.\n\nThe person is trying to change the girlfriend's views, but changing someone's deeply held beliefs, especially racism, is extremely difficult and often not effective. If the girlfriend is not open to changing, then the person might be enabling that behavior by staying in the relationship. On the other hand, the person is not engaging in racist behavior themselves, just choosing to be with someone who has those views. The question is whether that choice is wrong.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, supporting or not addressing racism is considered wrong because it contributes to a culture of discrimination. However, the person is actively trying to help their partner. But if the partner is not making an effort to change, then the person might be complicit by association.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether remaining in the relationship despite knowing about the racism is wrong. Since the friend is pointing out that it's a betrayal to their Black friend, and the girlfriend's racism is a problem, the person might be in the wrong for not taking a stand. However, the person is not a racist themselves, they're just in a relationship with someone who is. The line here is thin. If the person is not actively supporting or engaging in racist behavior, maybe they're not directly at fault. But by choosing to stay with the racist person, they could be seen as condoning those views, which is a form of being in the wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the person is not in the wrong because they are trying to address the issue. But the real question is whether the friend is right in pressuring them to break up, which is another layer. However, the main question is about the person's actions. Since the girlfriend is racist and the person is not taking a stance to end the relationship despite the harm, that could be considered wrong. So the answer might be A (in the wrong). But there's nuance. The person is trying to change her, but if that's not effective, maybe they should end it. If they don't, they might be enabling the racism. So the author could be in the wrong by not taking a stronger stance.\n"
