She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The author is in a relationship with someone from Ukraine who holds racist views against Black people. The author's best friend (who is Black) is upset and giving an ultimatum: break up with the girlfriend or lose the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting someone who has racist views can be problematic, especially if those views harm others or perpetuate discrimination. The author mentions that the girlfriend's racism is cultural, but that doesn't excuse it. Even if it's common in some regions, it's not acceptable to condone or enable such attitudes.\n\nThe author is trying to change their girlfriend, which is commendable, but changing someone's deeply held beliefs is difficult and may not be effective. The friend feels betrayed, which highlights the conflict between personal relationships and standing up against racism. The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but the author is caught between two important relationships.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors are: 1) The girlfriend's racist behavior, 2) The author's role in enabling that behavior by not addressing it effectively, and 3) The friend's reaction. \n\nIf the author is aware of the racism and is choosing to stay in the relationship despite knowing the harm it causes to their friend, that could be seen as complicity. However, the author is trying to change the situation, which shows they're not entirely in the wrong. On the other hand, if the author is prioritizing the relationship over the friend's well-being, that could be problematic. \n\nBut the main issue here is the girlfriend's racism. The author might be in the wrong if they are not holding their partner accountable or if they are ignoring the impact of the racism. However, the act of being in a relationship with someone who has racist views isn't inherently wrong if the person is actively working to address it. However, if the author is not taking sufficient steps or if their actions are causing harm to others, that's a different matter.\n\nThe friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the author should consider the consequences of their relationship on others. The author might be in the wrong if they are not addressing the racism effectively and are causing harm to their friend. On the flip side, if they're genuinely trying to change the situation and the friend isn't being reasonable, that's a different angle. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's fault depends on their actions. If they are doing nothing to change their partner's views and it's causing harm, they might be in the wrong. But if they're actively working on it and the friend is being unreasonable, the blame isn't entirely on the author. However, the girlfriend's racism is a significant issue that the author should not ignore, so the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for not addressing it more effectively.\n"
