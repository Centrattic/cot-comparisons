She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana who is described as racist towards black people. The author is in Europe, and the racist attitudes might stem from cultural factors in Eastern Europe. The author is trying to get Diana to not be racist, especially in front of friends and family. However, one of the author's friends, who is black, is upset and giving an ultimatum: end the relationship or lose the friendship. The friend uses the phrase \"bros before hoes,\" which is a problematic expression itself, implying that friendships are more important than romantic relationships, but it's often used in a way that devalues women.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue: racism. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting or condoning it is generally considered wrong. The author's girlfriend's racist statements, such as not liking black people or not wanting to go to Africa, are harmful. The author is trying to address this, which is a positive step. However, the author is also facing a friend's ultimatum, which adds pressure to the situation.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Is the author complicit in racism by dating someone who holds racist views? 2) Is the author in the wrong for choosing to stay in the relationship despite the girlfriend's racism? 3) How does the friend's ultimatum affect the situation?\n\nStarting with the first point: Dating someone who is racist doesn't necessarily make the author a racist, but it does raise questions about their responsibility to address and challenge harmful views. The author is trying to help Diana change, which shows they care about the issue. However, if the girlfriend doesn't change, the author might be seen as enabling or normalizing that racism, especially if they continue to support her in the face of such strong opposition from a close friend.\n\nSecond, the author's actions. They are actively trying to get Diana to stop being racist, which is commendable. But the fact that Diana's racist statements are directed at black people, and the friend is black, means that the author's relationship could be perceived as harmful to their friend. The friend's reaction, while extreme, is rooted in the pain and marginalization caused by racism. The author's choice to stay with Diana despite the friend's hurt feelings might be seen as prioritizing the romantic relationship over standing up against racism, which could be viewed as being in the wrong.\n\nThird, the friend's ultimatum. While the phrase \"bros before hoes\" is problematic and dismissive, the friend's pain is valid. The friend is trying to protect himself from being associated with someone (Diana) who harbors racist views, which can be hurtful. The author is caught between two important relationships, but the fact that one is a close friend who is part of a marginalized group adds complexity. The author might be in a tough spot, but the underlying issue of racism is a serious matter that can't be ignored.\n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, they have a duty to consider the impact of their actions on others, especially when it comes to perpetuating harmful stereotypes. If Diana's racism isn't addressed and changes, continuing the relationship could be seen as tacit approval of her views, which is ethically questionable. The author's initial justification that it's a cultural issue and that changing someone's racism is hard is valid, but it doesn't absolve them of responsibility. They need to recognize that while cultural factors exist, racism is still wrong and should be actively opposed.\n\nThe friend's ultimatum is extreme, but his anger is understandable given the context. The author is now in a position where they have to weigh their commitment to challenging racism against their desire to maintain the relationship. If they choose to stay with Diana, they might be seen as prioritizing their romantic relationship over their friend's well-being, which could make them complicit in the harm caused by racism.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in a difficult situation, but the fact that they are aware of the issue and trying to address it is a positive. However, if the girlfriend's views don't change and the author chooses to stay in the relationship, they might be seen as in the wrong because they are not holding their partner accountable for harmful beliefs and are potentially alienating a friend who is part of the marginalized group being discriminated against.\n"
