She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The situation involves a Ukrainian girlfriend named Diana who is racist towards black people. The author is in a dilemma because his friend, who is black, is upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The girlfriend's racism is the main issue. The author is trying to change her behavior but hasn't succeeded yet. His friend is threatening to end the friendship if the author doesn't break up with Diana. The author is caught between the two, not wanting to choose between them.\n\nRacism is a serious issue, and it's important to address. The fact that the girlfriend's racism is a cultural thing in Eastern Europe doesn't excuse it, but it's also true that changing someone's views is a long process. However, the author is in a relationship with someone who has these views, which can affect others around him, especially his friends.\n\nThe friend's reaction is strong, using \"bros before hoes,\" which is a problematic phrase that prioritizes male friendships over romantic relationships, especially in a way that devalues women. That's a red flag. The friend is making an ultimatum, which isn't healthy in any social relationship. But the author's decision to stay with Diana despite knowing she's racist could also be seen as problematic. \n\nThe author's argument is that he's trying to help her change, but the fact remains that the girlfriend's racism is causing harm. The friend's reaction is a consequence of that harm. The author might not be directly responsible for her racism, but by choosing to be in a relationship with someone who harbors those views, he is associating with them. This can make the friend feel betrayed, even if the author isn't a racist himself.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, he's trying to work on the relationship and change her views. On the other hand, he's prioritizing the relationship over a friend's feelings. The key point is that racism is harmful, and supporting someone who is racist, even if you're trying to help them change, can still perpetuate that harm. The author might not be a racist himself, but by being in a relationship with someone who is, he's allowing that racism to exist in his life and potentially affect others.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he is maintaining a relationship with someone who expresses racist views, despite knowing the impact it has on others. His choice to prioritize the relationship over his friend's well-being, even if he's trying to change the girlfriend, still puts him in a position of complicity or at least association with her racism.\n"
