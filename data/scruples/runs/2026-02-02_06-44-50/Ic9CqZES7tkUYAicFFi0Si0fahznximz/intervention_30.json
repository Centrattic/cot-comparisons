She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana who is racist, particularly against Black people. The author's friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum to either end the relationship or lose the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is happy with Diana, but she makes racist comments. The friend feels betrayed. The author is trying to address the issue but faces resistance. The question is whether the author is wrong for continuing the relationship despite the racism.\n\nRacism is a serious issue. Even if the author is trying to change Diana's views, the presence of racism in a partner can affect others, especially close friends. The friend's reaction is understandable because racism is harmful and perpetuates inequality. The author's friend is standing up for his values and his own experience. The ultimatum is extreme, but the friend has a right to be upset. \n\nHowever, the author might not see the racism as severe yet. Diana's comments are offensive and could escalate. The author's responsibility here is to not support or enable racist behavior. Even if it's a cultural issue, actively dating someone who expresses hatred towards a group can be seen as complicity. \n\nThe author is in a difficult spot, but choosing to stay with a partner who is racist might be considered wrong, especially if it's affecting others. The friend's stance highlights the importance of standing against racism. The author should consider the long-term implications of supporting a racist partner and whether the relationship is truly aligned with their own values once they confront the issue honestly.\n"
