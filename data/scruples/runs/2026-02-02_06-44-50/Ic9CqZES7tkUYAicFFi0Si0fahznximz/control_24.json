She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he's dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana who has racist views towards Black people. He's aware of this, and some of his friends, including a black friend, are upset because he's dating someone with those views. The friend is giving him an ultimatum to choose between the girlfriend or the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting or being in a relationship with someone who has racist views can be problematic. The author mentions that the racist behavior isn't extreme, like refusing to associate with Black people or engaging in hate speech, but it's still present, such as not liking Black people and not wanting to go to Africa. The friend feels betrayed because the author is choosing a partner over standing up against racism.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to work on changing his girlfriend's views, which shows he's aware of the problem and is attempting to address it. He's not endorsing her views but is in a relationship with her. It's possible that he's in a place where he's trying to be patient and give her a chance to change, especially since he attributes it to cultural factors. However, this could be seen as enabling her racism by staying in the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend is taking a strong stance against racism, which is valid. The ultimatum he's giving is harsh, but it reflects the importance he places on not being associated with racism. If the author is in a relationship with someone who is racist, even if he's trying to help them, others might view him as complicit, especially if he's not taking a firm stand against her views.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is complicit in or supportive of the racism. If he's actively trying to change her behavior, that might mitigate some responsibility. However, staying in the relationship despite knowing her views could be seen as endorsing them, especially if he isn't challenging them directly. The fact that he's faced with an ultimatum from a close friend suggests that his actions are causing harm to others, even if he doesn't feel that way.\n\nIn terms of cultural factors, while it's true that some regions may have ingrained biases, that doesn't excuse the racism. The author might be making a conscious choice to overlook or downplay these issues, which could be problematic. The question is whether he's responsible for her behavior and the impact it has on others.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is in a morally gray area. He's not explicitly supporting the racism, but he's in a relationship with someone who expresses it, and he's not taking a firm stand against it. By not taking a stronger stance, he might be seen as complicit, which could mean he is in the wrong. However, if he's genuinely trying to help her change, that could be a mitigating factor. But given the ultimatum from the friend and the potential harm caused to others, the balance might tip towards him being in the wrong. So, the answer would be A.\n"
