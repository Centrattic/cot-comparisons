She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The scenario is that the author's girlfriend, Diana, is racist against Black people. The author likes her a lot but is facing pressure from a friend who is Black and is being given an ultimatum to choose between the girlfriend or the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Dating someone with racist views can be problematic because it's not just about personal beliefs; it's about how those beliefs affect others. The friend is directly affected here since Diana's racism is directed at him and others. The author is in a situation where they're trying to balance their feelings for their partner with maintaining a friendship with someone who is hurt by the partner's views.\n\nThe author mentions that they've tried to get Diana to change her views, which is a positive step. However, just because someone is trying to change doesn't mean they've addressed the harm already caused. The friend feels betrayed, which is a valid reaction when someone they trust is in a relationship with someone who holds racist beliefs, even if the person is trying to change. The ultimatum from the friend is harsh, but the friend's hurt is understandable. \n\nCultural context is mentioned, but racism is a systemic issue that can't be excused as just cultural. It's important to recognize that while cultural background might influence someone's views, it doesn't justify them. The author's argument that it's a \"cultural thing\" might be minimizing the issue. \n\nThe author is caught between two people they care about, but the key issue here is whether supporting a partner with racist views is acceptable. The author might not be a racist themselves, but being in a relationship with someone who is can imply complicity, especially if the partner's behavior is directed at others they know. The fact that the friend is Kenyan and feels targeted adds weight to the situation because it's personal.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to work on their partner's views, which shows they're not condoning the racism outright. However, the decision to stay in the relationship might still be seen as a betrayal by the affected friend. Relationships require considering how your choices affect others, especially when those choices involve harmful beliefs.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for staying with Diana despite her racism. If the author is aware of the racism and it's affecting others, then by staying, they might be enabling that behavior, which is problematic. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the underlying issue is valid. The author needs to weigh their commitment to their partner against the harm caused to their friend. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author is making an effort to address the issue, staying in the relationship could still be seen as wrong because it allows the racist views to persist and harms the friend. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong), but there's nuance depending on how one views personal responsibility in relationships.\n"
