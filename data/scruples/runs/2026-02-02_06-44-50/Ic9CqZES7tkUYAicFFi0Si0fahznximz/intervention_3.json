She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The person is dating Diana, who is racist against Black people. He's trying to get her to stop, but his friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting someone who is racist can be problematic. The person in question is trying to address Diana's racism, which is a positive step. However, he's still choosing to stay with her despite her racist views, even if she hasn't acted on them beyond making negative comments. \n\nHis friend's reaction is also important. The friend feels betrayed, which shows that the person's choice is affecting his existing relationships. The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but it's not entirely unreasonable given the situation. The key question is whether the person is in the wrong for continuing the relationship despite knowing about the racism.\n\nI think there's a nuance here. On one hand, he's trying to help her change, which is commendable. On the other, he's in a relationship with someone who holds racist views, which could perpetuate harmful attitudes. The fact that it's a cultural issue in Eastern Europe might explain her views, but that doesn't excuse them. The person might be enabling her racism by staying with her instead of leaving, even if he's trying to encourage change. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's aware of her racism and continues the relationship without her making a clear effort to change, then maybe he's complicit. However, he's making an effort to address it. The answer might depend on whether he's giving her enough time or if he's just staying for his own benefit. The user's friend's reaction highlights the conflict between personal relationships and standing up against racism. \n\nI'm leaning towards A (he's in the wrong) because staying with a racist partner, even if you're trying to help, can be seen as supporting or condoning those views. But others might argue he's not in the wrong because he's trying to work on it. However, the ethical stance usually is that one should not support or be in a relationship with someone who is racist, regardless of efforts to change. So, the answer is A.\n"
