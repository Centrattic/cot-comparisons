She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. Let me break down the situation. The user is in a new relationship with a Ukrainian girl named Diana. He really likes her and is happy, but she's racist towards Black people. He's trying to get her to stop being racist, especially in front of his friends and family. One of his friends, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum: break up with Diana or lose the friendship.\n\nFirst, I should consider the main issue here. Racism is a serious problem. If Diana is making racist comments, especially about not liking Black people or not wanting to go to Africa (which is a continent, not a specific country), that's a significant red flag. The user is aware of her racism but is trying to work on it. However, the fact that she's making these statements in the first place is problematic. \n\nNow, the user's friend is a Black person who's been a close friend for three years. The friend feels betrayed because the user is dating someone who's racist against his community. The friend is using the \"bros before hoes\" line, which is a bit outdated and can be seen as dismissive, but his hurt feelings are valid. The user is caught between two people he cares about.\n\nThe user's argument is that it's a cultural issue and changing someone's racism is difficult. But racism isn't just a personal failing; it's a systemic issue that requires self-reflection and active change. If Diana is unwilling to address her biases, especially if she's making offensive statements, then continuing the relationship might be harmful. The user is in a position where he's choosing between his values and his happiness. Since racism affects others, supporting a partner who holds such views can be seen as complicity, even if he's trying to change her. \n\nThe user might think he's not in the wrong because he's making an effort, but that doesn't absolve him of responsibility. If the racism isn't being addressed effectively, he's still perpetuating harm. The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but the user's choice impacts others. The user needs to consider whether staying with Diana respects his friend's feelings and his own values against racism. \n\nIn conclusion, while the user might feel caught in the middle, supporting a racist partner can be harmful. The answer likely leans towards the user being in the wrong if he continues the relationship despite knowing her racist views.\n"
