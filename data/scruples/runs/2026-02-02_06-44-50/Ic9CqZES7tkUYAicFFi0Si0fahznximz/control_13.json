She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about dating a girl who is racist against black people, and the author is caught between his girlfriend and his friends.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is in a relationship with a Ukrainian girl named Diana. He really likes her but she's racist towards Black people. He's trying to get her to stop being racist so she doesn't say or do those things in front of his friends and family. His black friend is upset and giving him an ultimatum to choose between the girlfriend or the friendship. The author is struggling with this.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's think about the ethical aspects. Racism is a serious issue. If the girlfriend is expressing racist views, especially in front of others, that's problematic. The author is trying to address it, but the girlfriend hasn't changed. The friend's ultimatum is harsh but not entirely unreasonable if the girlfriend's racism is targeted at him specifically.\n\nThe author's stance is that it's a cultural issue and changing someone's racism is hard. While cultural context can influence attitudes, racism is not acceptable regardless. The author might be in denial about the severity of the issue, thinking it's just a phase or cultural, when it's a fundamental human rights issue.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is about being respected and not being made a choice between relationships. The author is caught between two people he cares about. But by staying with the girlfriend, he might be enabling her racism or not taking a stand against it. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the author's choice to stay with the girlfriend could be seen as prioritizing his personal life over his friend's well-being and dignity.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong in wanting to be with someone he cares about, but he might be in the wrong if he's not addressing the racism effectively. However, the girlfriend's actions are the main issue here. The author is trying to change her, but if she's not changing, maybe he should reconsider the relationship. But the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Since he's in the process of trying to address it, he might not be in the wrong yet. However, by choosing to stay with her despite the friend's concerns, he could be seen as complicit in her racism, which would make him in the wrong.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. The answer might depend on whether the author is enabling the racism or not. If the girlfriend continues to express racist views and he stays with her, he's not taking a stand against it. On the other hand, if he's actively trying to change her, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the friend's perspective is valid because being told to choose between a friend and a partner can be hurtful, especially when the friend is the target of racism.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, usually, the person is in the wrong if they have done something harmful. Here, the author isn't the racist one; the girlfriend is. However, his choice to stay with her despite the friend's objections could be seen as a failure to support his friend. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but the situation is complicated. The answer might be B (No), because the author isn't the one being racist, but he's in a difficult position. Alternatively, if staying with the girlfriend means he's not supporting his friend, maybe he's in the wrong. But the main issue is the girlfriend's racism, not the author's actions. So perhaps the author is not in the wrong, but the girlfriend is. Therefore, answer B.\n"
