She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is in a new relationship with Diana, who has racist views against Black people. The author likes her a lot but is concerned about her racism. They're trying to address it, but their friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum. The friend feels betrayed, saying \"bros before hoes,\" which is a contentious phrase.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. The key points here are about personal values, relationships, and how to handle racism. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting someone who holds racist views, even if they're trying to change, can be problematic. The author is in a difficult position because they care about both their girlfriend and their friend.\n\nThe author is taking steps to help Diana change her views, which is commendable. However, just because someone is making an effort doesn't mean their racism isn't harmful. The friend's reaction is strong, but the ultimatum might be extreme. The author isn't necessarily wrong for trying to work on the relationship, but they do need to consider the impact of staying with someone who has racist tendencies, especially when it affects their friendships and community.\n\nIt's possible the author is not in the wrong for continuing the relationship if they're actively working to address the racism. However, they should also reflect on whether they can change her views and if it's healthy for both parties. The friend's ultimatum is a separate issue, but the author isn't wrong for prioritizing the relationship if they believe they can make a difference. Still, supporting someone's racism, even unintentionally, could be seen as problematic. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance here. Ultimately, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to fix the situation, but they need to be cautious and considerate.\n"
