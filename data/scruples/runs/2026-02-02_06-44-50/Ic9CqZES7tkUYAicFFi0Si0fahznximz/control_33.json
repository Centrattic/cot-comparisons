She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend and not breaking up with her despite a friend's ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is dating Diana from Ukraine. She's racist towards Black people, which the author is trying to address. The author's Black friend feels betrayed and gives an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friend. The author is trying to handle this without breaking up.\n\nThe key points here are the girlfriend's racism and the author's response. Racism is a serious issue. The author says they are trying to get their girlfriend to stop being racist, but it's not clear if they've done enough. The friend's reaction is strong, but using \"bros before hoes\" might be problematic because it's a toxic phrase that prioritizes friendships over other relationships, especially when it involves race. However, the friend's hurt feelings are valid given the racist comments.\n\nThe author is in a difficult position. They like their girlfriend but are aware of her racism. They're trying to address it, but the friend is upset. The question is whether the author is wrong for not breaking up yet. \n\nIn terms of responsibility: the author should have considered the girlfriend's views before getting into a serious relationship. It's not just about changing her views but also about standing against racism. If the girlfriend is open to change and the author is actively helping, maybe it's not the author's fault entirely. However, if the racism is a deal-breaker for the author's friend and they're choosing not to break up, that could be problematic.\n\nBut the author hasn't made the choice yet. They're trying to mediate. The real issue is whether supporting a partner despite their racism makes the author complicit. The answer might depend on cultural context, but the friend's reaction, while harsh, is about racism, which is a serious issue. The author needs to weigh their commitment to their friend's feelings and the girlfriend's change.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they are choosing to stay with someone who is racist despite knowing the impact on their friend. Even if they're trying to change the girlfriend, staying in the relationship could still support the racism. So answer A.\n"
