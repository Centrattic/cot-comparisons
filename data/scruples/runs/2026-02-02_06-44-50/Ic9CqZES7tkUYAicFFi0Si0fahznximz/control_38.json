She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the guy is in a new relationship with Diana, who he really likes. He mentions she's racist against Black people, which he attributes to cultural factors from Eastern Europe. He's trying to change her behavior, but his black friend is upset and giving him an ultimatum: break up with her or lose the friendship. The friend uses \"bros before hoes,\" which is a problematic phrase itself because it devalues relationships and can be dismissive of serious issues like racism.\n\nNow, the key points here are about the girlfriend's racism. The user is trying to address this, but it's not clear how responsive Diana is to his efforts. The friend is making a choice for him, which is intense. The user is caught between two important relationships and is trying to navigate it without making a choice yet.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, dating someone with racist views isn't inherently wrong, but it's important to consider the impact of staying in a relationship where harmful beliefs exist. Racism is a serious issue, and if the girlfriend refuses to change or if her actions are harmful, the user might be enabling that behavior by staying with her. However, the user is making an effort to address it, which is a good sign.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's ultimatum is problematic because it's a \"bros before hoes\" approach, which often prioritizes male friendships over relationships, especially when a woman is involved. This phrase can be used to invalidate the importance of a romantic relationship and can be part of toxic masculinity. The friend's reaction is extreme and doesn't allow for dialogue or understanding. The user isn't necessarily choosing between two equals here; the friend is imposing a choice that might not be fair.\n\nSo, is the user wrong? If he continues to stay with the girlfriend despite her racism, he might be complicit, especially if she doesn't change. But if he's actively trying to address it, maybe he's not in the wrong yet. However, the friend's ultimatum is definitely problematic. The user's mistake might be not addressing the racism more directly or not recognizing the harm it causes. Alternatively, if the girlfriend's racism is a deal-breaker for him, he might need to make a choice himself rather than letting the friend dictate it.\n\nIn summary, the user's situation is complex. The friend's ultimatum is an issue, but the user's decision to stay with the girlfriend despite her racism could also be seen as wrong if he's not taking a stand against racism. However, the user is trying to work on it, so maybe he's not entirely in the wrong yet. The answer might depend on whether the girlfriend is willing to change and how the user is handling the situation.\n"
