She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that the author is dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana, who has racist views against Black people. The author's friend, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum to choose between the girlfriend and the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend's racism is the main issue. The author mentions that it's a cultural thing in Eastern Europe, but he's trying to get her to stop being racist, especially around his friends and family. However, his friend is pushing back hard, leading to the ultimatum.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author is in a relationship with someone who has racist views. Even if it's a cultural norm in her background, racism is generally considered harmful and unacceptable. The author is making an effort to address this, which is positive, but the girlfriend has not changed her behavior. The fact that she made specific racist statements (disliking Black people and not wanting to go to Africa) is problematic, especially when one of his close friends is Kenyan.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to navigate a complex situation. He's in love and happy with Diana, and he's attempting to work on her views. The friend's reaction is harsh, using the \"bros before hoes\" ultimatum, which might be too extreme. The author is caught between two important relationships and isn't happy with the ultimatum.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for continuing the relationship despite her racism. Even if he's trying to change her, the reality is that he's supporting someone who holds harmful beliefs. While it's true that changing someone's deeply held beliefs is difficult, the author has a responsibility to consider the impact of being in a relationship with a racist person. His friend's anger is justified given the personal offense and the betrayal of trust by dating someone who discriminates against a group they belong to.\n\nMoreover, the author's approach might not be effective. Encouraging someone to change their views is one thing, but staying in the relationship if those views are not changing could perpetuate the issue. The author might be enabling her racism by not taking a firmer stance. It's possible that by staying with her, he's not only hurting his friend but also reinforcing her harmful beliefs.\n\nHowever, the cultural context is a factor. The author mentions that in Eastern Europe, there might be more prevalence of such attitudes. But that doesn't excuse the racism; it's a personal choice to engage with someone who holds those views. The author's friend has the right to feel betrayed, especially since the author is choosing the girlfriend over an important friendship. The author's decision to continue the relationship despite the friend's valid concerns could be seen as prioritizing his own happiness over respecting his friend's experience.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author is trying to address the issue, the decision to stay with a racist partner when it's causing significant conflict and harm to a close friend might place the blame on him. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because supporting someone with racist views, especially when it's causing direct harm to others, is problematic and he's not taking sufficient action to distance himself from the harmful behavior.\n"
