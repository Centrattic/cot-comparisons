She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The person is in a relationship with Diana, who has racist views, particularly against Black people. The user's friend is upset and giving an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friend. The person is trying to navigate this, but the friend is being aggressive with the \"bros before hoes\" line.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main ethical issues here. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting or being in a relationship with someone who holds racist views can be problematic. The user is trying to change his girlfriend's views, but it's unclear how effective that is. The friend's reaction is strong, but ultimatums in friendships can be hurtful too.\n\nThe user is caught between two important relationships. The key point is whether the user is complicit in the racism by continuing the relationship despite knowing her views. The friend's argument is that dating a racist is a betrayal, especially since one of the friends is Black. The user's stance is that it's a cultural issue and trying to change someone is hard.\n\nBut racism isn't just a cultural thing; it's a harmful ideology that affects real people. Even if the girlfriend grew up in an environment where such views are common, the user has a responsibility to consider the impact on others. By continuing the relationship, the user might be normalizing her behavior, which could hurt their Black friend and others.\n\nAlso, the user is being given an ultimatum, which is a harsh response, but the friend's feelings are valid if the user isn't taking the racism seriously. The user's approach of trying to change the girlfriend is commendable, but if she's not making progress, maybe the user should reconsider the relationship. Staying in a relationship with someone who holds racist views can perpetuate harm, even if the user isn't directly racist themselves.\n\nSo, the user is in a tough spot, but the fact that they are aware of the racism and have friends who are affected means they have a moral obligation to address it. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the user's choice to stay with the girlfriend despite the racist views might be seen as supporting that racism. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for not taking a stronger stance against the racism in their partner.\n"
