She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe user is dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana who is racist against Black people. He likes her a lot but is facing pressure from a friend who is Black. The friend is upset that the author is dating someone racist and is giving him an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friendship. The author is trying to convince Diana to stop being racist but hasn't had much success yet.\n\nFirst, I should consider where the responsibility lies. The user mentions that racism isn't a big issue in Europe, but it's more of a cultural thing in Eastern Europe. He's trying to help Diana change, which is commendable, but is that enough? The key issue here is whether the author is supporting or enabling racism by staying with Diana despite her views.\n\nThe Black friend feels betrayed, which is a valid reaction. Choosing a romantic partner over a friend who challenges your values can be seen as prioritizing personal relationships over standing against racism. However, the author isn't the one being racist; it's his girlfriend. So he's in a tough spot. But is he in the wrong for not immediately ending the relationship?\n\nAlso, the friend's ultimatum is harsh. Using \"bros before hoes\" is a problematic phrase that devalues the Black friend's experience. The author is caught between two people, but the core issue is whether he's complicit in racism by not ending the relationship. If he's aware of her racism and isn't taking steps to address it, maybe he's enabling it. But he is trying to change her behavior. However, changing someone's racism isn't something the author can force. \n\nThe user is not the one being racist, but by continuing the relationship, he might be giving Diana a platform to express her views, which could hurt others. His friend's reaction is about loyalty and values. So the question is, does the author have a responsibility to end the relationship if his girlfriend's racism is causing harm? \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, supporting a partner despite their racist views could be seen as complicity. However, the author isn't the one being racist. The answer might hinge on whether the author is actively supporting the racism or just not stopping it. If he's trying to change her behavior, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the fact that he's facing this ultimatum suggests that his actions (or inactions) are causing harm to his friend.\n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because by not taking a clear stand against his girlfriend's racism, he is enabling her behavior and prioritizing his personal relationship over his friend's well-being. However, I'm a bit conflicted because he is trying to change her. But ultimately, associating with someone who holds racist views can be seen as complicity, especially if it harms others.\n"
