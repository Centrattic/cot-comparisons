She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person is dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana, who's described as beautiful, smart, funny, and sweet. They really like her and are happy with her. The problem is that Diana is a bit racist against Black people. The author is in Europe, which the user notes isn't a major problem there, but mentions that Eastern Europe might have cultural issues with racism. The author's dad told stories about Russians making threatening gestures towards Black people during work trips. The author is trying to help Diana become less racist, but some friends, including a close Black friend, are upset. The friend gave an ultimatum: either stop dating Diana or lose the friendship. The author is caught between two important relationships.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Racism is a serious issue. Even if it's a cultural norm in some regions, that doesn't excuse it. The author is in a position where they are supporting someone who holds racist views, which could affect others, especially their Black friend who feels betrayed. The friend's reaction is strong, but ultimatums can be harsh. The author might be trying to balance their feelings for Diana with standing up against racism. However, supporting a partner's racist behavior, even if they're trying to change, could be problematic. The key here is whether the author is complicit in racism by not addressing it more firmly. The author says they're trying to help Diana, but if Diana's racism is causing harm to others, the author might be enabling that harm. Also, the friend's ultimatum, while extreme, is about loyalty and values. The author's choice here reflects where they stand on racism. If they choose to stay with Diana despite her racist comments, they might be prioritizing their romantic relationship over a close friendship and their friend's well-being. That could make them complicit in a way, even if they're trying to change Diana. On the other hand, if the racism isn't severe (just not liking Black people and not wanting to go to Africa), maybe it's a matter of personal views rather than active harm. But even that is disrespectful. The author's responsibility is to not tolerate racism, even if it's in their partner. They might need to consider whether they can change Diana's views or if it's better to distance themselves to avoid being associated with racism. Since the user initially thought the author was in the wrong, I need to see if that's justified. The answer hinges on whether the author is enabling racism by staying with Diana despite her views and the impact on their friend. So, the author might be at fault for not taking a stronger stance against racism, hence being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
