She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for dating a girlfriend they describe as racist. The girlfriend is Ukrainian and has expressed racist views against Black people, particularly the user's Kenyan friend. The user is caught between their girlfriend's behavior and their friend's ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Racism is a serious issue, and allowing it to persist in one's personal relationships can be problematic. The user mentions that their girlfriend's racism might be cultural, but that doesn't excuse it. The fact that she makes derogatory remarks about Black people, especially when a close friend is affected, is a red flag. \n\nThe user's friend is upset and has given an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend and the friendship. The user is trying to mediate, but their friend feels betrayed. The user is in a tough spot, but the key question is whether they are in the wrong for continuing the relationship despite the girlfriend's racism.\n\nOn one hand, the user might argue that they are trying to address the issue and that changing someone's racist views is difficult. However, supporting or enabling racism, even if unintentionally, can be seen as complicit. The girlfriend's actions directly affect others, and the user's decision to stay with her could be harming their friend. \n\nIt's also important to consider accountability. If someone is in a relationship with a racist person and doesn't take steps to hold them accountable, they might be enabling harmful behavior. The user has tried to address the issue, but if the girlfriend isn't making efforts to change, the user might be responsible for not standing against racism.\n\nThe user's friend's stance is about loyalty and values. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is a clich\u00e9, but in this context, it's about prioritizing the friendship over a relationship that's causing harm. The user needs to weigh their loyalty to their girlfriend against their values and the well-being of their friend.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user is in a difficult situation, continuing a relationship with someone who expresses racism, especially when it harms others, can be seen as endorsing that behavior. The user is in the wrong for not taking a stronger stance against the racism and for allowing the situation to escalate to an ultimatum. The correct answer is A.\n"
