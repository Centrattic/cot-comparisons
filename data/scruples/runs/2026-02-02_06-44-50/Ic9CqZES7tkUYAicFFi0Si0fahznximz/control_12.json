She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's dating a Ukrainian girl who has racist views against Black people. He mentions that in Eastern Europe, this might be more culturally accepted, but he's trying to get her to stop being racist, especially around his friends and family. His best friend, who is Black, is upset and gave him an ultimatum: break up with the girlfriend or lose the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The main points here are about racism and the conflict between relationships. The girlfriend's racism is a problem. The author is trying to address it, but it's not clear if her views are something that can be changed. The friend feels betrayed, which is a strong reaction.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author wrong for choosing to stay with someone who is racist? Well, racism is a serious issue. If someone is openly racist, especially against a specific group, that can be harmful. The fact that the friend is Black and feels this way adds weight to his perspective. The author is being asked to choose between his girlfriend and his friend. But is the author wrong for wanting to stay with his girlfriend despite her racist views?\n\nI think the key here is whether the author is enabling or supporting racism. If the girlfriend is making racist comments, especially in front of others, the author has a responsibility to not condone that behavior. Even if it's part of her culture, racism is wrong regardless of where it comes from. The author is trying to get her to stop, which is the right thing to do, but if she's not changing, maybe staying in the relationship is problematic. The friend's reaction, while harsh with the ultimatum, is based on the fact that the author is dating someone who is racist, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong for trying to work on the relationship, but if the girlfriend's racism persists, continuing the relationship could be seen as supporting that behavior. The friend's stance is that the author is betraying by dating someone racist, which is a valid perspective given the harm racism causes. So, the author's choice to stick with the girlfriend could be wrong if it means upholding her racist views, even if he's trying to change her. The answer might depend on whether the girlfriend is actually changing or if the author is just ignoring the issue. Since the girlfriend's actions are clear (disliking Black people, not wanting to go to Africa), and the author is aware of this, he might be complicit if he continues the relationship without addressing it effectively. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong if he's not taking sufficient action to counter her racism.\n"
