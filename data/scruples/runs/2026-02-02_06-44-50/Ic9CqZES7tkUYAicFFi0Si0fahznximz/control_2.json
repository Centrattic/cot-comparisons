She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that the author is dating a Ukrainian girl who has racist views against Black people. The author is trying to change her but faces an ultimatum from a friend who's Black. The friend is upset and wants the author to stop dating her or lose his friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The main points are: the girlfriend is racist, the author is aware of this, and they\u2019re trying to address it. The author's friend is pushing for them to end the relationship. But is it the author's responsibility to fix someone else's racism? Also, is the author complicit just by being with her?\n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to respect each other's values. If one partner has harmful beliefs that the other finds unacceptable, it can strain the relationship. However, the author seems to be trying to work on this. However, racism is a serious issue. By continuing the relationship despite knowing her racist views, the author might be enabling those views or not taking them seriously enough. \n\nThe friend's reaction is also important. He's Black and feels betrayed, which is valid because the author's choice to date someone with racist views could affect their friendship. The author is caught between two important relationships. \n\nBut the key question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author isn't the one with the racist views, but by staying in the relationship, they might be endorsing those views indirectly. The author's defense is that it's a cultural issue and that changing racism is hard. However, just because it's cultural doesn't excuse the behavior. Everyone is responsible for their own views, regardless of cultural background. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not taking a firmer stance against racism, even if they're trying to change their girlfriend. The fact that the girlfriend made specific racist remarks (disliking Black people, not wanting to go to Africa) is problematic. The author's friend has a right to be upset because the author's actions (dating someone racist) could be seen as complicity. \n\nBut the author is trying, so maybe they're not entirely in the wrong. However, the expectation here is that if someone is in a relationship with a racist person, they should prioritize not supporting or enabling that racism. The author might need to reconsider the relationship's sustainability if the girlfriend isn't willing to change. \n\nIn the end, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether they're actively supporting or ignoring the racism. If they're making efforts but the girlfriend isn't changing, the author might be doing the right thing. But if they're staying in the relationship despite knowing her views and not addressing them effectively, they could be complicit. The answer might be a bit nuanced, but given the context, the author might not be in the wrong entirely because they're trying to address the issue, but there's a case to be made that they should have left the relationship if the racism wasn't changing. However, the question is if they are \"in the wrong\" right now. Since they're trying, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but there's a risk of being in the wrong if they don't take further action.\n"
