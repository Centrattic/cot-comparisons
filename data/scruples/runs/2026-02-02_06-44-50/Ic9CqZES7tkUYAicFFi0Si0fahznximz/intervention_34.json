She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author in this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe author is dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana for a week. He really likes her and finds her beautiful, smart, etc. But there's an issue: Diana is racist against Black people. The author is in Europe, where such racism might be more culturally accepted, but he's trying to get her to stop being racist around his friends and family. One of his friends, who is Black and a close friend for three years, is upset and giving an ultimatum: break up with Diana or lose the friendship. The author is trying to mediate but is stuck between the two.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. The options are A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Racism is a serious issue. The fact that it's more culturally accepted in some regions (like Eastern Europe) doesn't make it okay. The author is aware of her racism and is trying to change her views, which is commendable, but the central question is whether he's in the wrong for continuing the relationship despite her racism.\n\nOn one hand, the author might be trying to be open-minded and give her a chance to change. On the other hand, supporting someone who holds racist views, especially when it affects others and causes conflict in his own life, could be seen as problematic. The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but his feelings are valid given the racism directed at Black people. The author is being asked to choose between the relationship and the friendship, which is tough, but maybe the problem is that the author is enabling the racism by staying with Diana instead of taking a stand.\n\nThe author mentions that the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like Black people much and wouldn't want to go to Africa. That's a direct expression of racism. Even if it's a cultural thing, it's still a choice to express those views. The author's friend feels betrayed because he values the friendship with a Black person. The author might be in a position where he's prioritizing the romantic relationship over standing against racism, which could be seen as the wrong choice.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If he's aware of the racism and it's causing harm to others, then maybe he is complicit by not taking a stronger stance. However, if he's actively trying to change her views, he might feel he's doing the right thing. But the ultimatum complicates things. The friend's approach is extreme, but the core issue is the racism. The author's decision to stay with the girlfriend despite her racism might be enabling harmful behavior, making him partially responsible. So, while the girlfriend is clearly in the wrong for being racist, the author might be in the wrong for not recognizing that and continuing the relationship, especially when it's causing conflict with a close friend.\n"
