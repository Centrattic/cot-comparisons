She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend is from Ukraine, which the author mentions might be a cultural thing. The author is trying to get her to not be racist, especially towards Black people, but a friend is threatening to end the friendship if the author doesn't break up with her. The friend is Kenyan and feels betrayed.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is wrong here. The author is in a relationship and facing pressure from a friend. The key points are the girlfriend's racism, the author's attempts to change her, and the friend's ultimatum.\n\nRacism is a serious issue. Even if it's part of the culture, supporting or continuing to be in a relationship with someone who holds racist views can be problematic. The author is aware of the racism and is trying to address it, but the fact that the girlfriend makes explicit racist comments (like not liking Black people and not wanting to go to Africa) is a red flag. \n\nThe friend is validly upset because the girlfriend's racism affects him personally. The author is choosing between the relationship and the friendship, which is a tough spot. However, aligning with someone who has racist views, even if you're trying to change them, can be seen as complicity. The author might be in the wrong if they're not taking a clear stance against the racism. Supporting a partner's harmful behavior, even if you're trying to help them change, doesn't address the harm done to others.\n\nThe answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they're in a relationship with someone who is racist and not effectively addressing it, which harms others. But maybe there's nuance. The author is trying to help, but if the racist behavior continues, it's still an issue. Since the girlfriend hasn't changed her views, dating her could perpetuate the problem. The friend's ultimatum, while harsh, highlights the conflict between the author's loyalty to the girlfriend and their friend. In that case, the author might be in the wrong for not taking a stronger stand against racism despite their efforts. Alternatively, if the author is genuinely trying to help, maybe they're not in the wrong. But given that the racist behavior is explicit and harmful, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
