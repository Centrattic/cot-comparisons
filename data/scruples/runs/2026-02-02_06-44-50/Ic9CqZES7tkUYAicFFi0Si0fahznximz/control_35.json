She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend, Diana, is described as having racist views against Black people. The author is trying to get her to stop being racist, especially around friends and family. But some friends, including a black friend, are upset and giving an ultimatum. The black friend feels betrayed and is saying \"bros before hoes,\" which is a problematic phrase itself because it devalues relationships and people of color.\n\nNow, the author is in a tough spot. They like Diana but are also concerned about her racism. The key points here are: 1) The girlfriend is racist, 2) The author is trying to address it, 3) Friends are upset, leading to an ultimatum. \n\nIs the author wrong for choosing to stay with the girlfriend despite her racism? Well, the author isn't the one being racist. They're trying to address it, which is a positive step. The friend's ultimatum is extreme and uses a harmful saying. However, the girlfriend's racism is a serious issue that affects others. The author needs to consider the impact of staying in a relationship where the partner holds racist views, even if it's culturally ingrained. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is not the one being racist and is making an effort to address it, they might not be in the wrong. However, the situation is complex because they're enabling the girlfriend's behavior by staying with her. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not if the girlfriend is. So the answer would likely be B (No), because the author is not the one being racist, even though the situation is complicated.\n"
