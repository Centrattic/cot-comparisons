She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation again carefully.\n\nThey're dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana for a week. They really like her, but she's racist against Black people. The person lives in Europe, and they mention that in Eastern Europe, racism might be more prevalent due to cultural reasons. They've tried to get her to stop being racist, especially around their friends and family. One of their friends, who is Black, is upset and gave an ultimatum: stop dating Diana or lose the friend. The author is conflicted and doesn't want to make a choice but is trying to reason with both parties.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about supporting a partner's racist views versus standing up for a friend. Let's break it down.\n\nRacism is a serious issue. If the author is aware that their girlfriend is racist and has done things like making derogatory comments about Black people (like not liking them or not wanting to go to Africa), then they might be complicit by not addressing it. The author mentions trying to change her behavior, which is a good step, but if those efforts aren't effective or if the author is enabling her racism by staying in the relationship, that could be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to balance their feelings for Diana with their loyalty to their Black friend. The friend feels betrayed and is using the \"bros before hoes\" argument, which is a common but harmful trope that prioritizes male friendship over relationships, often at the expense of women. The author is caught in a difficult situation where they don't want to lose either the girlfriend or the friend.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they are supporting a partner who holds racist views, even if they're trying to change her, they might be enabling that behavior. However, if they're actively trying to address the racism and aren't condoning it themselves, they might not be in the wrong. The key is whether they are okay with or promoting the racism. If they are in a relationship with someone who is racist and don't take a stand against it, even if they're trying to change them, they could be seen as complicit.\n\nAlso, the friend's ultimatum is a red flag. Using a phrase like \"bros before hoes\" is dismissive of the girlfriend and reinforces harmful stereotypes. The friend should not be giving an ultimatum based on such a problematic statement. However, the author's decision to stay with Diana despite her racism could be seen as prioritizing their relationship over supporting their friend against racism.\n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, even if the racism is culturally ingrained, they have a duty to distance themselves from harmful behavior. Supporting a partner who is racist can be harmful, even if it's not their own view. The author might be enabling the racism by staying in the relationship, especially if they're not willing to leave despite the friend's valid concerns.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they're choosing to stay with someone who is racist and allowing that behavior to continue, even if they're trying to change her. They should consider that staying in the relationship could perpetuate the racism and harm others, including their friend. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). However, there's a nuance here because the author is trying to address the issue. But ultimately, if the racism isn't being effectively addressed and the author isn't taking a stronger stance, they could be complicit.\n"
