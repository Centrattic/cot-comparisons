She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that the author's girlfriend from Ukraine is racist against Black people, and some of his friends, including a Black one, are upset. The friend is giving an ultimatum to break up with the girlfriend or lose the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend's racism is a problem. The author is trying to address it, but the friend is pushing for a choice. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for staying with his girlfriend despite her racism.\n\nRacism is a serious issue. Even if the girlfriend is otherwise a good person, holding onto a relationship where racism is present can be problematic. The author's friend, who is Black, feels betrayed, which is understandable. The author's stance might be that he's not responsible for her racism, but he's still choosing to be in a relationship with her. \n\nHowever, the author might be in a tough spot because he's trying to change her behavior. But the reality is that the girlfriend's views are harmful, and supporting someone with racist views can perpetuate that harm. The author's friends are right to be concerned because the girlfriend's comments are offensive and exclusionary. \n\nThe author's friend's ultimatum is harsh, but the underlying issue is valid. The author is caught between two important relationships, but the presence of racism in the relationship is something that needs to be addressed seriously. If the girlfriend isn't willing to change, the author might be complicit in her racism by staying in the relationship. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in a difficult position, but staying with a racist partner despite knowing the harm it causes could be considered wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
