She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation involves the girlfriend's racism against Black people, and the user is facing pressure from a friend who is Black to choose between the relationship and the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key elements here. The girlfriend is described as having racist attitudes, specifically towards Black people. The user is trying to address this with her, but it's not clear if she's making any effort to change. The friend, who is Black, feels betrayed and is giving an ultimatum. The user is caught between the two.\n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, supporting racism is not acceptable. If the girlfriend's racism is a significant part of who she is and she isn't willing to change, staying in the relationship might be problematic. However, the user might be in a difficult position where they are trying to handle the situation sensitively. \n\nBut here's the thing: the user is in a relationship with someone who holds racist views. Even if it's a cultural issue, as the user suggests, it's a harmful belief. The user is aware of the issue and is trying to work on it, but if the girlfriend isn't making an effort to change, the user might be enabling those views by staying. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but his reaction highlights the real harm caused by racism. \n\nOn the other hand, the user might not be directly racist themselves, just in a relationship with someone who is. However, being in a relationship with someone who is racist could be seen as complicity, especially if the user isn't taking a stand against the racism. The user's friend is pointing out that the user is prioritizing the girlfriend over a long-time friend, which adds to the complexity.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user is in a tough spot, but the main issue is whether they are at fault for not taking a stronger stand against the racism. If the user isn't doing enough to challenge the girlfriend's racism or is allowing it to persist, then they could be complicit. Therefore, the answer might be that the user is in the wrong because they are supporting someone with harmful views without addressing it adequately.\n"
