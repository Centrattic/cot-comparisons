She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The key points here are the girlfriend's racism, the friend's ultimatum, and the author's position.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is described as racist towards Black people. The author mentions she says she doesn't like Black people and wouldn't want to go to Africa. That's clearly discriminatory. The author is trying to change her views, which is commendable, but the friend is upset and giving an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend and the friendship. The friend references \"bros before hoes,\" which is a problematic phrase that minimizes the importance of relationships with partners compared to friendships with men, especially in a way that devalues women.\n\nNow, the author is torn. They like their girlfriend and don't want to lose her but also value their friend. The question is whether the author is wrong to date a racist person. Racism is a serious issue, and tolerating it can be harmful. However, the author isn't the racist one; they're trying to address the problem. The friend's ultimatum is harsh and dismissive of the author's feelings and the girlfriend's potential for growth. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is part of a toxic masculinity that undervalues women and can enable harmful behavior by prioritizing male friendships over respecting personal relationships.\n\nOn one hand, the author isn't the one being racist, so they aren't directly in the wrong for being with a racist partner. But they might be enabling or not addressing the racism effectively. However, the story shows the author is trying to work on the issue. The friend's reaction is more problematic because it uses a sexist mantra and imposes an unfair choice. The author isn't wrong for not giving in to that ultimatum, especially if they believe the girlfriend can change. The real issue is the girlfriend's racism and the friend's toxic approach. So the answer is B (not in the wrong), but the deeper issue is the racism and the friend's problematic stance.\n"
