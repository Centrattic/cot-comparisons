She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a girl who's racist. The situation involves the author's girlfriend, Diana, who holds racist views against Black people. The author is trying to change her behavior, but his friend, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Racism is a serious issue, and being in a relationship with someone who holds racist views can be problematic. The author mentions that his girlfriend's racism is a cultural thing from Eastern Europe, but even if it's culturally ingrained, that doesn't excuse it. The author is aware of her racism and is trying to work on it, which is commendable, but the fact remains that his friend is directly affected by this and feels betrayed.\n\nThe key points here are the impact on the Black friend and the ultimatum. The friend is one of the author's best friends, and the ultimatum is causing a rift. The author is caught between two people he cares about. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for choosing to stay with his girlfriend despite her racism. \n\nIt's important to note that while cultural factors can influence beliefs, racism is a harmful ideology that can lead to discrimination and prejudice. The girlfriend's actions, such as expressing dislike for Black people, are hurtful and contribute to systemic issues. The author's friend is within his rights to feel upset and to set a boundary. The author's decision to prioritize his relationship over his friend's feelings could be seen as being in the wrong, especially if the girlfriend continues to express racist views despite his efforts to change her.\n\nHowever, the author is also trying to address the problem, which shows he's not complicit. But the reality is that supporting someone with racist views, even if you're trying to help them change, can still be damaging to others. The friend's reaction is a natural consequence of feeling targeted by the girlfriend's comments. The author's friend is making a choice based on his own values and boundaries, which is valid.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author is actively trying to address the issue, the fact that he's choosing to stay in the relationship despite the girlfriend's racism and the resulting conflict with his friend suggests that he might be in the wrong. The friend's ultimatum is a reaction to being personally affected by the girlfriend's views, and the author's decision to side with his girlfriend over his friend's well-being could be seen as ethically flawed.\n"
