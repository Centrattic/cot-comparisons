She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the person is dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana who has racist views against Black people. They mention that in Eastern Europe, such attitudes might be more culturally accepted, but the author is trying to address this by encouraging Diana to stop being racist. However, a close Black friend is upset and is giving the author an ultimatum: either end the relationship or lose the friendship. The author is conflicted and doesn't want to choose, but the friend is being very firm.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. They want to know if that's correct.\n\nI need to consider the ethical implications here. Dating someone with racist views is a sensitive issue. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting or being in a relationship with someone who holds such views can be problematic, especially if the person is aware of the racism and chooses to stay in the relationship despite efforts to change the other person's views.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to help Diana change her views, which is commendable. However, the fact that Diana is openly expressing racist sentiments, even if not acting on them, is an issue. The author's friend is rightly upset because it's discriminatory and harmful. The author is putting their friend's feelings and the well-being of their friend (who is Black) at risk by staying with Diana.\n\nThe cultural context is mentioned, but that's not an excuse for racism. Just because a behavior is culturally accepted doesn't make it right, especially when it's harmful to others. The author's decision to stay in the relationship despite knowing Diana's racism could be seen as enabling that behavior and not standing up for what's right.\n\nMoreover, the author is being asked to choose between two important relationships, which is a tough spot. But the friend's ultimatum is a valid reaction to the situation. The author might be prioritizing their romantic relationship over the friendship and the values of inclusion and respect that the friendship was built on.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions to help Diana are good, staying in a relationship with someone who is racist can be seen as supporting that racism, even if it's not the author's own views. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not taking a firmer stance against racism in this situation.\n"
