She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. Let's start by looking at the key points.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is described as racist towards Black people. The author mentions that this might be a cultural issue, as in Eastern Europe, but they're trying to change her views. The problem arises when the author's friend, who is Black, is upset and gives an ultimatum: end the relationship or lose the friendship. The author is struggling between their feelings for their girlfriend and their friendship with someone who's been a close friend for years.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the ethical aspects. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting or being in a relationship with someone who holds racist views can be problematic. However, the author is trying to address the issue, which shows they're not condoning the racism. The challenge here is that changing someone's racist beliefs is complex and not solely the responsibility of the partner. \n\nThe friend's reaction seems extreme with the \"bros before hoes\" comment, which is a problematic attitude in itself. It's not right to force someone to choose between relationships, especially if one is a close friend and the other is a romantic partner. The author isn't being asked to support the racism but is facing a situation where their partner's views are causing harm to others.\n\nHowever, the author's responsibility is to address the racism in their partner. If the girlfriend is making derogatory comments, the author should make it clear that such behavior is unacceptable. The fact that the author is trying to get her to stop shows they're on the right path, but it's important to consider that just being in a relationship with someone who is racist can be harmful, even if they're trying to change.\n\nIn terms of the author's actions, they are in a difficult position. They're not the one being racist, but their partner's views are causing conflict. However, by continuing the relationship, they might inadvertently be giving their partner a platform for her racist views, which can be harmful. The author needs to evaluate how committed they are to changing their partner's views and whether the partner is genuinely willing to change.\n\nThe friend's ultimatum is also a red flag. Friends shouldn't make such demands, but the author's dilemma is whether to stand by someone they care about despite their harmful views. In ethical terms, the author might not be in the wrong for choosing their romantic partner, but they should also consider the impact of their choice on others and their own values.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being in the relationship, but they do have a responsibility to address the racism. The real issue is the girlfriend's actions and the author's willingness to support her despite those actions. The answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong, but they need to continue working on the situation.\n"
