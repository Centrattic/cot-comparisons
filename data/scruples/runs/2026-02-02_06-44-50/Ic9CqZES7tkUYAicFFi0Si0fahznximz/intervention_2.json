She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The scenario is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) post where the person is conflicted between their girlfriend's racism and their friend's ultimatum. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend is described as having racist views, specifically against Black people. The author mentions that it's a cultural thing in Eastern Europe, but they're trying to change her behavior. The friend, who is Black, feels betrayed and gives an ultimatum between the girlfriend and the friendship.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. I should analyze both sides. On one hand, the author is in a relationship with someone who holds racist beliefs. Choosing to be in a relationship with someone who expresses racism can be problematic, especially if it affects others, like the author's friend. The friend's reaction is understandable because racism is a serious issue, and supporting someone who is racist could be seen as complicity.\n\nOn the other hand, the author claims they're trying to help the girlfriend change, which shows effort. They also mention that the racism might be cultural and that changing deeply held beliefs is difficult. However, simply trying to change someone's views doesn't absolve the relationship of the harm caused by those views. The ultimatum from the friend is harsh, but the friend's stance on racism is valid. Choosing between the girlfriend and the friend puts the author in a tough spot, but aligning with the racist girlfriend over the friend might not be the right choice.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is supporting racism by continuing the relationship despite knowing her views. Even if it's a cultural issue, actively being in a relationship with someone who expresses racist sentiments can be seen as endorsing those views. The author's friend is standing up for themselves, which is commendable. The author's reluctance to make a choice might indicate a lack of prioritization of anti-racism in their life.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's feelings for the girlfriend are genuine, the fact that they are in a relationship with someone who is racist and are not willing to make a clear choice (despite the friend's ultimatum) suggests that they might be in the wrong. Supporting a partner's racist views, even if they're trying to change, can be problematic. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
