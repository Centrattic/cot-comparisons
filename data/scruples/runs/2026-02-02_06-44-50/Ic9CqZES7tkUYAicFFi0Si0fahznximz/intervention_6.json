She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The scenario is that he's dating a Ukrainian girl, Diana, who has racist views against Black people. He mentions that racism might be cultural in Eastern Europe, and he's trying to change her views. His friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The user is in a relationship with someone who holds racist beliefs. He's aware of her racism, is trying to change her, but she still makes racist remarks. The friend feels betrayed and is pressuring the user to end the relationship. The user is conflicted, not wanting to choose between the two.\n\nThe user's question is whether he's in the wrong for staying with Diana. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should think about the ethical implications here. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting someone who holds racist views can be problematic, especially if those views harm others. The user's friend is directly affected by Diana's racism, as she made a comment about not liking Black people and not wanting to go to Africa. The friend, being Kenyan, would find that deeply offensive. \n\nWhile the user is trying to address her racism, if her views are causing harm to others (like his Black friend), then continuing the relationship might be seen as condoning or enabling that behavior. The user's friend is within his rights to feel hurt and to set boundaries. The user is essentially choosing to be with someone whose views hurt his friend, which can be seen as a betrayal of the friend's feelings and values. \n\nAdditionally, the user's argument that it's a cultural issue and hard to change is a common defense but doesn't excuse the racism. It's important to challenge harmful beliefs rather than excuse them as cultural. The user's responsibility isn't just to change his girlfriend but also to consider the impact on others. \n\nSo, even if the user likes Diana and the relationship makes him happy, the fact that he's aware of her racism and she's making offensive remarks means he's potentially in the wrong for not taking a stand against her harmful views. His friend is entitled to his feelings, and the user's choice to prioritize the girlfriend over the friend's well-being could be seen as ethically wrong.\n"
