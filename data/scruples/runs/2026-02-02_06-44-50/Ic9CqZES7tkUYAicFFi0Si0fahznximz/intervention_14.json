She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation involves a guy who's dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana. He really likes her, but she's racist against Black people. He's in Europe, where maybe it's less of an issue, but he's trying to get her to stop being racist. His friend, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum: stop dating the girl or lose his friendship. The guy is caught between his new relationship and his long-term friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend's racism is the main issue. The user mentions that she doesn't like Black people and wouldn't want to go to Africa. The friend who's Black feels betrayed and is using a \"bros before hoes\" argument. The question is whether the guy is in the wrong for choosing to stay with his girlfriend despite her racism.\n\nNow, thinking about racism. Racism is a serious issue, and being in a relationship with someone who holds racist views can be problematic. The guy is trying to get her to change, which is commendable, but it's not his responsibility to cure her racism. However, if he continues to support her racist behavior, even if it's cultural, he might be complicit in it. His friend's reaction is understandable because it's a matter of respect and standing by his friend.\n\nThe friend's ultimatum is harsh, but it's also about his personal boundaries. The guy is being asked to choose between his friendship and his new relationship. The question is whether the guy is wrong for choosing the relationship. \n\nIn relationships, compatibility is key. If someone's core values are incompatible with yours (like racism), that can be a deal-breaker for others. The friend feels that the girlfriend's racism is a betrayal because he's part of the group she's racist against. The guy might be in the wrong if he prioritizes his new relationship over his friend's feelings and the friend's well-being.\n\nAlso, considering that the friend is a long-time friend and the girlfriend is new, the guy's decision to stay with her despite the friend's distress could be seen as prioritizing a new relationship over an existing friendship. But on the other hand, the friend's ultimatum is extreme and might not be fair either.\n\nHowever, the guy is trying to address the racism, which is a positive step. But if the racism continues, he might be enabling it by staying with her. The question is whether it's right to stay with someone who is racist, even if you're trying to change them. \n\nIn many cases, people might argue that it's not your place to \"fix\" someone else's racism. The girlfriend's views could affect how the guy is perceived by others, especially his Black friend. The fact that the friend feels betrayed and is losing trust in the guy is a significant consequence.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the guy is in the wrong for choosing to stay with a racist partner when it's causing harm to his friend. Even if it's a cultural issue, supporting someone who holds racist views can perpetuate those views and harm others. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
