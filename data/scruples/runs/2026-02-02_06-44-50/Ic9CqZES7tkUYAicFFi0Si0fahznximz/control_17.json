She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The question is based on an AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana. She has racist views against Black people. He mentions that it's common in Eastern Europe, but he's trying to get her to stop being racist around his friends and family. One of his friends, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum: break up with Diana or lose the friendship. The author is conflicted because he likes Diana a lot but values his Black friend's feelings.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the girlfriend's racism, the author's attempts to address it, the friend's ultimatum, and the author's stance. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by choosing to stay with the girlfriend despite her racism.\n\nRacism is a serious issue. Even if it's culturally influenced, it's important to consider the impact on others. The author's friend feels betrayed, which is a valid reaction. However, the author is trying to work with his girlfriend to change her behavior, which shows he's aware of the problem. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong for not breaking up with her yet.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to address harmful behaviors. If someone is racist and doesn't change, it can affect others around you. The author is in a tough spot because he's balancing his feelings for his girlfriend against his friend's well-being. But is he in the wrong? Well, if he continues to support a partner who is racist, even if it's a cultural issue, it could be seen as enabling her behavior. However, if he's actively trying to help her change, maybe not.\n\nBut the friend's ultimatum is harsh. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is problematic because it dismisses the seriousness of racism. However, the friend's hurt is real. The author might be in a difficult position where he's not directly causing harm but is complicit by not ending the relationship. \n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, it's his choice, but he should consider that by staying with Diana, he might be supporting her racist views, which can affect others. If she doesn't change, then yes, he's in the wrong for not taking a stand. But if he's genuinely trying to help her, maybe not. The answer might depend on whether there's any effort to change. The author mentions he's tried to get her to stop, which is a positive step. However, just trying isn't enough if she's not making progress. \n\nOverall, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being in the relationship if he's actively working to address the racism. But if the racism persists and he chooses to stay, it could be seen as wrong. The question is whether he's in the wrong now, before the issue is resolved. Given the information, the author is trying to help, so maybe he's not the asshole. But the friend's perspective is valid because the racism is directed at someone close to him. \n\nThe answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because he's making efforts and the friend's reaction is extreme, but there's a gray area. However, the presence of racism is a significant issue, and if the author continues to support it, there's a case for him being wrong. But since he's actively trying, maybe not. Final answer: B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
