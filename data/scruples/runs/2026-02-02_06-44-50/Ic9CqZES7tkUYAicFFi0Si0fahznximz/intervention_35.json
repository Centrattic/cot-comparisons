She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The scenario involves a guy dating a Ukrainian girl who is racist against Black people. His friend, who is Black, is upset and gives an ultimatum. The guy is trying to reconcile his feelings for his girlfriend with his friend's hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend is racist, which the author seems to attribute to cultural factors. He's trying to address her racism but she hasn't changed. His friend is a Black person who feels betrayed and is pushing for a choice between the girlfriend and the friendship. The author is caught in the middle and doesn't want to make the choice but is considering staying with his girlfriend.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is. Let me consider the ethical aspects here. Racism is a serious issue. By dating someone who is racist, especially against Black people, the author might be enabling that behavior. Even if it's cultural, being in a relationship with someone who holds such views could be seen as complicit, especially if he's aware of the harm it causes.\n\nThe friend's reaction is also important. The Black friend is directly affected by the girlfriend's racism. The ultimatum is harsh, but the friend has valid reasons to feel hurt and betrayed. The author's response is to try to calm him down and work on changing his girlfriend, but if she's not changing, then maybe he's prolonging the issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a new relationship and really likes her. He's trying to address her racism. However, the fact that she hasn't changed and continues to express her racism in front of friends and family is a problem. The author's responsibility here isn't just to his girlfriend but also to his friend and the broader community affected by racism.\n\nIs it reasonable to continue a relationship with someone who is unwilling to change their racist views? The author is in a position where he can influence her by setting boundaries. If she's not willing to change, then he's enabling her racism by staying with her. That would put him in the wrong because he's allowing harmful behavior to persist.\n\nAdditionally, the author's friend is directly impacted, and the ultimatum, while harsh, stems from a place of personal hurt. The author's choice to stay with the girlfriend despite her racism could be seen as prioritizing the relationship over the well-being of his friend, which is a judgment call but does suggest a possible fault in the author's priorities.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong by not taking a firm stance against his girlfriend's racism and not protecting his friend's feelings. He's asked to choose between two people, but by staying with the racist girlfriend, he's choosing someone who harms the feelings of his Black friend. That's a problem because he could be complicit in that harm.\n"
