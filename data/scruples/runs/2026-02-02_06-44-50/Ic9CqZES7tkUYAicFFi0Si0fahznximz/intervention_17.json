She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The author is in Europe, dating a Ukrainian woman who's racist against Black people. He's trying to get her to stop, but his friend (a Black person) is giving him an ultimatum: break up or lose the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is aware of her racism and is making an effort to address it. He's trying to encourage her to change, which is a good step. However, the girlfriend's racism is a significant issue. The friend is upset because the author is in a relationship with someone who holds racist views, which the friend sees as a betrayal. The author is caught between two important relationships.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, being in a relationship with someone who's racist might be problematic, especially if that racism affects others around them. The friend's reaction is understandable because it's a personal issue. But on the other hand, the author is trying to work on the problem rather than ignoring it. He's not endorsing her views but is attempting to address them. The girlfriend's actions might be influenced by her cultural background, which the author mentions is common in Eastern Europe. That might explain some of her attitudes, but it doesn't justify them.\n\nThe author's friend is using \"bros before hoes,\" which is a problematic phrase because it devalues the girlfriend and the author's feelings. The ultimatum itself is harsh and doesn't allow for a nuanced solution. The author is not necessarily at fault for trying to maintain the relationship while working on the issue. However, he might be in a difficult position where he's not fully addressing the racism or not being clear about the boundaries he's willing to set. If he continues the relationship without the girlfriend changing her views, it could perpetuate harm, but if he's actively trying to address it, that's a positive step.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for trying to work through the issue, but the situation is complex. The answer might depend on how committed he is to changing the dynamic and whether the racism is causing direct harm. Since the question is a yes/no, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's making an effort and not ignoring the problem. However, there's a risk in staying with someone who's racist, so it's a nuanced situation.\n"
