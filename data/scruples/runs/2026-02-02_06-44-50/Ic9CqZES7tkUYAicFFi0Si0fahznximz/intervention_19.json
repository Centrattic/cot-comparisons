She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that the author's girlfriend, Diana, is from Ukraine and has racist views against Black people. The author is trying to get her to stop being racist, but a friend who is Black and a close friend is upset and giving an ultimatum: end the relationship or lose the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The girlfriend's racism is a problem. The author is in a new relationship and really likes her but is aware of her racism. He's trying to address it but is facing pressure from a friend. The friend is using \"bros before hoes\" and giving an ultimatum, which is a bit of a red flag in itself because ultimatums can be toxic.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, dating someone with racist views could be seen as problematic because it's a matter of values and respect. If someone holds racist beliefs, even if they're cultural, it's harmful. The author is trying to help her change, which is good, but the existence of the racism is an issue. However, the author isn't the one being racist; he's in a relationship with someone who is. The question is whether he's in the wrong for choosing to stay with her despite her racism.\n\nOn one hand, the author might not be directly racist himself. He's trying to address her behavior. On the other, he's in a relationship with someone who expresses racist views, which can be hurtful and complicit in systemic racism. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the underlying issue is valid. The author is choosing a partner over a friend, which can be a tough call, but the core question is about the morality of being in a relationship with someone who is racist.\n\nI think the key here is that the author's actions are problematic because he's allowing his partner's racism to continue, even if he's trying to change her. Supporting someone who holds racist views, even if you're trying to correct them, can be seen as enabling that behavior. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not holding a firm boundary against racism in his relationship. So the answer would be A.\n"
