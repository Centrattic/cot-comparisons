She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend and facing an ultimatum from a friend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is dating a Ukrainian girl, Diana, who has racist views against Black people. He's been trying to address this, but some friends, including a Black friend, are upset. The friend is giving an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friend. The author is conflicted.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user already thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. Let's break it down.\n\nRacism is a serious issue. Even if cultural factors play a role, supporting or not addressing racism can be problematic. The author mentions that Diana's racist comments include not liking Black people and not wanting to go to Africa. The friend who's Kenyan feels betrayed. \n\nNow, the author is trying to change her views, but the friend sees the relationship as a betrayal. The friend's stance is strong, even if it's phrased as \"bros before hoes,\" which is a problematic phrase itself, implying that relationships with women are less important than friendships with men. But the core issue is the racism.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, dating someone who holds racist views could be seen as endorsing those views, especially if the author doesn't take a stand against them. The author is aware of the racism and is trying to change her, but maybe that's not enough. If the author continues the relationship despite knowing the racist behavior, they could be complicit. However, the author is trying to work on it, which complicates things.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's ultimatum is also problematic. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is dismissive of relationships and can be used to pressure someone into choosing friendship over a romantic partner, which isn't healthy. So the friend might be at fault here as well.\n\nBut the main question is about the author. If the author is in a relationship with someone who is racist, and they don't actively challenge those views, they might be complicit. However, the author is trying to help Diana, which shows they care. But racism isn't something that can be easily changed, and being in a relationship with a racist person might cause harm to others, like the friend who's Black.\n\nSo, if the author continues the relationship despite the friend's valid concerns, they might be in the wrong. The friend's stance is about protecting their own values and feeling respected. The author has to consider whether staying in the relationship is worth losing a close friend who's directly affected by the racism.\n\nIn conclusion, while the friend's approach is harsh, the author's situation is complex. However, if the author supports Diana's racism or doesn't take it seriously enough, they could be complicit. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but there's nuance here. The author's efforts to change her are a point in their favor, but if they don't address the racism adequately, they might still be at fault.\n"
