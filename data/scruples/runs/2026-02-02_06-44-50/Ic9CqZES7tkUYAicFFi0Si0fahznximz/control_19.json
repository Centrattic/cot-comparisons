She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The situation involves the author's girlfriend, Diana, who is Ukrainian and has racist views against Black people. The author is trying to get her to stop being racist, but his friend, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum: break up with the girlfriend or lose the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The author is in a relationship with someone who holds racist beliefs. He's making an effort to address it, but his friend is taking a firm stance. The friend's approach is confrontational, using a \"bros before hoes\" ultimatum, which might be seen as toxic. The author is caught between two people he cares about and is trying to navigate the situation without making a choice he's uncomfortable with.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the question hinges on whether dating someone with racist views is inherently wrong. The author isn't necessarily endorsing the racism; he's in a relationship with someone who has these views. However, by choosing to stay with Diana despite her racism, is he complicit? Or is he doing his best to support her while also trying to maintain his friendship?\n\nI should consider the impact on the Black friend. The friend feels betrayed because the author isn't standing up against racism in his partner. The friend's reaction is a response to being targeted by racism through the girlfriend's actions. The ultimatum is harsh, but the underlying issue is valid: racism is harmful and needs to be addressed.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be trying to handle the situation sensitively, given that the racism could stem from cultural background. He's attempting to work on it with Diana. However, staying in a relationship where racism is present can be problematic, as it may perpetuate harmful attitudes. The author might be enabling the behavior by not confronting it more directly or ending the relationship if Diana isn't willing to change.\n\nBut the author hasn't explicitly stated that he's ignoring the racism. He's actively trying to get her to stop. The question then is whether he's in the wrong for not leaving the relationship despite her racism. If the friend is part of his close circle and feels this is a deal-breaker, the author's choice might be seen as prioritizing the relationship over the friend's well-being. However, the author isn't the one being racist; it's his girlfriend. So maybe he's not directly responsible for her views, but he is responsible for choosing to be with someone who holds those views.\n\nI think the answer here depends on whether the author is actively supporting or condoning the racism. If he's making efforts to address it, he's doing the right thing. However, if he's staying in the relationship despite knowing the harm it causes, he might be in the wrong by not taking a stronger stance. The friend's reaction is extreme, but the author's choice to stay with the girlfriend could be seen as perpetuating the problem. So, the author might be in the wrong because he's allowing the racist views to continue in his circle, even if he's trying to change her.\n"
