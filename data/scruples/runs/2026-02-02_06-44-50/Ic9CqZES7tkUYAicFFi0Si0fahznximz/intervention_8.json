She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that he's dating a girl who's racist against Black people, and his friend is giving him an ultimatum between the girlfriend and the friendship. The user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend is racist, which is a serious issue. The author is defending her by saying it's cultural and hard to change. But racism is a personal choice, not just a cultural trait. Even if it's common in some regions, supporting or staying with someone who holds racist views can be problematic, especially when it affects others.\n\nThe friend points out that the author is betraying him by dating someone who's racist, leading to an ultimatum. The author is trying to downplay it, saying it's not a big deal because he's in Europe, but his friend is Kenyan and directly affected. The girlfriend's specific comments about not liking Black people and not wanting to go to Africa are clear examples of racism, which the author is choosing to overlook.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If someone is in a relationship with a racist person and doesn't take action to address it, especially when it harms others, they could be complicit. By not holding his girlfriend accountable, the author is enabling her behavior. The fact that he's being given an ultimatum from a friend highlights the severity of the situation. The friend is right to be upset because the author's choice to stay with the racist partner is hurting him.\n\nThe author is also being defensive about his girlfriend's behavior, which shows a lack of accountability. He's trying to justify her racism as cultural, but that's an excuse. Racism is wrong regardless of cultural context. The author should take this seriously and consider ending the relationship if his girlfriend isn't willing to change, rather than choosing between his friend and her. Supporting a racist partner is a choice, and it's the author's responsibility to take a stand against racism, even if it's difficult.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the answer is that the author is in the wrong. He's allowing his girlfriend's racism to continue, which is hurting his friend and others. He should prioritize standing up against racism and support his friend, even if it means breaking up with his girlfriend.\n"
