She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend is racist against black people, and the author is trying to change her. The friend, who is black, is upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The girlfriend's racism is a problem. The author is trying to address it, but the friend is pushing for the author to break up with her or lose the friendship. The author is caught in the middle.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, supporting racism is generally considered wrong. If someone is in a relationship with someone who holds racist views, it's important to consider whether those views are harmful. The girlfriend's statements about not liking black people and avoiding Africa could be hurtful. The fact that the friend is Kenyan adds a personal touch here since the racism directly affects him.\n\nThe author might be in a tough spot because they genuinely like their girlfriend and are trying to help her overcome her racism. But just because it's a cultural issue doesn't excuse the behavior. Racism is a personal responsibility, and while changing someone's views is hard, being in a relationship with someone who expresses racism can be problematic, especially if it affects others close to you.\n\nThe friend's ultimatum is harsh, but his stance is about standing up against racism. The author's friends are upset, which suggests that the girlfriend's racism is impacting the social circle. The author might be in the wrong if they're enabling the behavior by staying in the relationship despite knowing the harm it causes.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not be in the wrong if they're actively trying to address the issue. However, just trying isn't enough if the racist behavior continues and affects others. The key is whether the author is complicit in the racism by not taking enough action. If the girlfriend refuses to change, the author might be enabling her racism by staying with her.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might be good, they could still be in the wrong by continuing the relationship if the girlfriend's racism is not being addressed adequately. The friend's reaction is extreme, but the underlying issue of racism is serious. The author needs to consider the impact of their choices on others and whether they're truly doing enough to combat the racism in their partner.\n"
