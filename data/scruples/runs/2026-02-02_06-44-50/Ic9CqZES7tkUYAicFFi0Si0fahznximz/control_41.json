She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation involves a Ukrainian girl named Diana who has racist views against Black people. The author is trying to address this, but his friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Dating someone with racist views can be problematic because it's not just about personal beliefs but also how those beliefs affect others. The author mentions that Diana's racism isn't too bad in Europe but points out specific instances like her dislike of Black people and not wanting to go to Africa. The friend's reaction is strong, feeling betrayed, which adds to the conflict.\n\nThe author is caught between his feelings for Diana and his friendship. He's trying to help her change her views, which is commendable, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key here is the impact of Diana's racism on others. Even if it's culturally influenced, supporting or staying with someone who holds racist views can perpetuate harm. \n\nThe author might argue that he's not the one being racist, just dating someone who is. However, being in a relationship with a racist person can involve complicity, especially if their actions affect others. The friend's ultimatum is a significant factor because it shows that the racism is causing direct harm to his friend's feelings and their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not be directly responsible for Diana's beliefs, but by choosing to date her despite her racism, he could be enabling those views. The line between personal choice and accountability is tricky here. If the author is aware of her racism and still chooses to be with her, especially when it's causing others distress, there's an argument that he's in the wrong for not taking a stand against her views.\n\nAdditionally, the author's efforts to help Diana change are noted, but the persistence of the problem and the ultimatum from a close friend suggest that the situation is more complex. The friend's stance is about loyalty and values, which are important in friendships.\n\nIn summary, while the author might not be a racist himself, being in a relationship with someone who is racist and not addressing it effectively can lead to being complicit. The impact on others, like the friend, is significant. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not taking stronger actions against his girlfriend's racism, especially when it's causing direct harm to his friend's feelings and their friendship.\n"
