She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girl named Diana. The author mentions that Diana is racist against Black people, which is causing tension with his friend who is Black. The friend is giving an ultimatum: stop dating Diana or lose the friendship. The author is conflicted because he really likes her but is being pressured to choose.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting someone who holds racist views can be problematic. Even if the racism is cultural, the author is in a position where he can influence change. However, the author is trying to address it by working with Diana to reduce her racist behavior.\n\nNext, the friend's reaction. The friend feels betrayed and is using \"bros before hoes\" as a justification. While the friend's feelings are valid, the ultimatum might be extreme. The author might feel pressured to conform to his friend's expectations, but relationships should ideally be based on mutual respect and understanding.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not be in the wrong if he's actively trying to change Diana's views. But the issue is that he's still with someone who expresses racism, which can affect others around him. The friend's reaction is a response to being targeted, which is understandable. The author has to balance his relationship with Diana and his friendship with his Black friend.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's decision to stay with Diana despite her racism could be seen as problematic because he's not fully addressing the harm her views cause. The friend's stance is about standing against racism, which is a valid position. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not prioritizing anti-racism in his relationship.\n"
