She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana who is racist against Black people. He likes her a lot but is facing pressure from his friend, who is Black, to break up with her. The friend is giving him an ultimatum: end the relationship or lose the friendship. The author is trying to manage both, but it's causing conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspects. Racism is a serious issue. Even if it's cultural or learned behavior, as the author mentions, it's still harmful. The fact that some of his friends, including a Black one, are upset shows that this isn't trivial. The girlfriend's racist comments, like not liking Black people or not wanting to go to Africa, are direct expressions of prejudice.\n\nThe author claims he's trying to help her overcome her racism. But is that enough? Change takes time, but if someone is in a relationship with a racist, they might be complicit by not setting boundaries. The friend's reaction is understandable because the author is dating someone who holds views that directly harm his community. The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but it's a response to being targeted by racism through the girlfriend's actions.\n\nThe author is caught between his feelings for his girlfriend and his friendship. However, supporting a partner's racist views, even if trying to change them, can be problematic. It's important to recognize that the Black friend's feelings are valid. Being told to choose between a friend and a partner is tough, but the author might need to evaluate what kind of relationship he's in. If the girlfriend isn't willing to address her racism, staying with her could perpetuate harm.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have known about her racism initially. People can change, but if the racism is ongoing and he's not taking a stand, he could be enabling it. The key is whether he's actively supporting her to change or if he's making excuses for her behavior. If he's not willing to address it directly, he might be complicit.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author is in a difficult situation, the fact that he's dating someone with racist views and not taking a firm stance against it could make him complicit. His friend's anger is justified because racism affects real people's lives. The author might need to reconsider his priorities and recognize that supporting racism, even unintentionally, is wrong. So, the answer would be that he's in the wrong.\n"
