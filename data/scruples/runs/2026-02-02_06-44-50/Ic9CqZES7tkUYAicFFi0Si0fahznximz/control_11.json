She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend is from Eastern Europe, and she's racist against Black people. The author is trying to get her to stop being racist but faces an ultimatum from a friend who is Black. The friend says the author is betraying him by dating her and gives an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the girlfriend's racism and the author's response. Dating someone with racist views is a personal choice, but supporting or tolerating racism can be problematic. However, the author is trying to address the issue and change her behavior, which might mitigate their responsibility. But is it enough?\n\nRacism is a serious issue, and being in a relationship with someone who holds racist views could be seen as complicity, especially if the author doesn't actively work to challenge those views. However, the author is attempting to correct her behavior. The friend's reaction is strong, but the ultimatum might be extreme. The question is whether the author is wrong to prioritize their relationship over the friendship, or if they are wrong for not breaking up with their girlfriend.\n\nThe answer depends on whether the author's actions contribute to or support racism. If the author is genuinely trying to address the issue, they might not be in the wrong. However, if they are enabling the racism by staying with her despite the harm, they could be at fault. The cultural context mentioned (Eastern Europe's history of racism) might explain the girlfriend's views, but doesn't excuse them. The author is in a tough spot, but the main issue is whether they are complicit in racism.\n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because supporting someone with racist views, even if you're trying to change them, can be seen as complicity. The author should prioritize ending the relationship to stand against racism, especially when it affects their friendship. However, the situation is complex, and some might argue the author isn't at fault for trying to help. But the core issue is whether their actions support racism, which they might be by staying with her.\n"
