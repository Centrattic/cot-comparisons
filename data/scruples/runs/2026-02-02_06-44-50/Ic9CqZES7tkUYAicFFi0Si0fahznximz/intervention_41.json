She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The author is in Europe, dating a Ukrainian woman named Diana. She's described as racist against Black people, which is causing conflict with his friend, especially one who is Black. The friend is giving an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend and him. The author is trying to handle it by encouraging Diana to not be racist but feels pressured.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the girlfriend's racism and the author's response. Racism is a serious issue, and dating someone with racist views might be problematic, especially if it affects relationships with others. The author mentions that his friend is Black and is hurt by the situation. The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but his feelings are valid given the racism involved.\n\nThe author is trying to change Diana's views, which is a good step, but maybe he's not addressing his own part in the situation. By continuing the relationship despite her racism, he might be indirectly supporting her views, even if he's trying to help her change. Also, the cultural aspect is mentioned, but racism isn't excused by culture. It's a personal choice and a moral issue.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong because he's prioritizing the relationship over the feelings of his friend who is directly affected by the racism. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the author's decision to stay with Diana could be seen as perpetuating the racist behavior, even if unintentionally. The right thing would be to distance himself from someone who holds such views, especially if they're harmful to others. So, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong).\n"
