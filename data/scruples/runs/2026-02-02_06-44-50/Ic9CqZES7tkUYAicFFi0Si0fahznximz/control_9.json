She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the user is dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana who he really likes. However, she's racist against Black people, and this has caused a conflict with his friend, who is Black. The friend is making an ultimatum: either the user breaks up with Diana or they stop being friends. The user is caught between his girlfriend and his friend and is trying to navigate this situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The user is in a relationship with someone who has racist views. He's trying to address her racism, which he acknowledges is a problem. The friend is upset because the girlfriend's racism is being directed at him, specifically. The friend's response is an ultimatum, which the user is struggling to handle.\n\nRacism is a serious issue. Even if the user is trying to help his girlfriend change, the fact remains that his girlfriend is expressing racist views. The user is in the position where he is dating someone who holds these views, which directly affects his friend. The friend is Kenyan and is being targeted by the girlfriend's comments about not liking Black people and not wanting to go to Africa. That's offensive and harmful, regardless of cultural context.\n\nNow, the user isn't in the wrong because he's not the one being racist. He is actively trying to address his girlfriend's behavior. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong for continuing the relationship despite her racism. The user is trying to balance his feelings for his girlfriend with his friendship. But racism is a systemic issue, and supporting someone who expresses racist views can be problematic because it can perpetuate harm.\n\nThe user's friend has the right to be upset, as the girlfriend's comments are directed at him. The user may not be the one making the racist remarks, but he is in a relationship with someone who does, and by continuing the relationship without her changing her views, he might be enabling that behavior. However, the user is making an effort to change her views, which shows that he's not condoning them.\n\nBut the key here is whether the user is in the wrong. If he is aware that his girlfriend is racist and continues the relationship despite knowing the harm it could cause, especially when it's affecting a close friend, there could be an argument that he is not fully supporting his friend's well-being. On the other hand, if the user is trying to address the issue, maybe he's not entirely at fault.\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The user's intentions are to change her views, but as long as she maintains those views, he's in a relationship with someone who holds them. The ultimatum from the friend complicates things. However, the user himself isn't the one being racist. So maybe he's not in the wrong because he's not the one expressing racism. But others might argue that he's failing to take a stand against racism by staying with her. The answer depends on whether one believes that staying in a relationship with a racist person is complicit in their behavior.\n"
