She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The situation is that the author is in a new relationship with a Ukrainian woman who has racist views towards Black people. The author's friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girl's racism is part of the relationship, and the author is trying to address it. The friend is a long-time acquaintance, so the conflict between the two is significant. The user wants to know if the author is at fault here.\n\nOn one hand, the author might not be directly responsible for the girl's racism, as they acknowledge it could be cultural. They're also trying to work on changing her views. But on the other hand, supporting someone with racist views, even if it's part of their culture, can be problematic. The friend's reaction is about betrayal, which the author might feel is unfair, but the friend's perspective is valid because racism directly affects them and others.\n\nThe author is caught between their relationship and their friendship. The question is whether they're wrong for choosing to stay with the girlfriend despite her racism. Choosing a partner over a friend in this context might be seen as ignoring the harm the partner's views cause, especially to the friend. However, the author isn't necessarily endorsing the racism; they're trying to address it.\n\nBut relationships where one partner holds harmful views can be problematic. Even if the author is trying to help, the presence of racism in the relationship affects others, and the friend's ultimatum is a reaction to that. The author's stance is that they're not in the wrong, but the friend feels betrayed. It's a complex situation where both sides have valid points.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, supporting someone who holds racist views can be seen as complicit, even if the person isn't acting on it. The author might not be the one being racist, but by staying in the relationship, they're allowing the racism to persist. So, depending on the perspective, the author could be seen as enabling the behavior.\n\nHowever, the author is making an effort to change the girlfriend's views, which is a positive step. But the fact that the girlfriend makes offensive statements (like not liking Black people or wanting to go to Africa) is harmful. The author's friend is directly affected by these statements, hence the conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author is trying to address the racism, the decision to stay with the girlfriend despite her views might be seen as supporting those views indirectly. The friend's reaction, while harsh, is a response to the harm caused. Therefore, the author could be considered partially at fault for not taking a stronger stance against the racism, even if they're not personally racist.\n"
