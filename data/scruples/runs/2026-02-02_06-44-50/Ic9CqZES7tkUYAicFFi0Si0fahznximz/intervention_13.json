She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation involves a Ukrainian girl named Diana who holds racist views against Black people. The author is conflicted between his feelings for her and the disapproval from his friend, who is Black, leading to an ultimatum situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. Racism is a serious issue, and the author is aware that Diana's views are problematic. He's trying to encourage her to change, which is commendable, but it's a complex process. The key point is whether the author is at fault for continuing the relationship despite her racism.\n\nThe author mentions that Diana's racism is cultural, referencing experiences in Eastern Europe. However, just because something is culturally prevalent doesn't excuse racism. The author's responsibility involves recognizing that racism is harmful and that being in a relationship with someone who holds such views can perpetuate those attitudes, even if the person isn't a monster.\n\nThe friend's ultimatum adds pressure, but the author's decision should ultimately be based on his own values. However, the fact that his friend feels betrayed indicates that the author might be complicit by not taking a stronger stance against the racism. The author's argument that he's trying to help her change is valid, but personal change is difficult, and the author might be enabling the behavior by staying in the relationship without clear boundaries.\n\nAlso, the author doesn't explicitly condemn Diana's racism; he's trying to get her to stop saying or doing it in front of others. This might mean he's not directly addressing the root of her beliefs, just the public expression. That could be seen as insufficient, especially given the harm racism causes to others.\n\nIn terms of the ultimatum, the friend's reaction is extreme, but the author's choice to prioritize the relationship over friendship despite the racism could be problematic. The author's responsibility extends beyond himself; by being in a relationship with a racist person, he might be contributing to a supportive environment for her views, which can affect others, especially marginalized individuals.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because he's enabling a harmful behavior by staying in the relationship instead of taking a stand against racism. Even if he's trying to change her, his inaction in confronting the racism directly could be seen as complicity.\n"
