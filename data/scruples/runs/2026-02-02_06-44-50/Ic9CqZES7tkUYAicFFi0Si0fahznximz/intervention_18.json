She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The situation involves a Ukrainian girlfriend named Diana who is racist towards Black people. The author is conflicted between his feelings for her and the disapproval from a close Black friend who is making an ultimatum. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Dating someone with racist views can be problematic because racism is a serious issue that affects others. The friend feels betrayed, which adds to the tension. The author is trying to address the issue by encouraging Diana to change her views, but the friend isn't satisfied. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for continuing the relationship. On one hand, the author is trying to work on changing the girlfriend's views, which shows some effort. However, enabling or tolerating racism can be harmful. Even if it's a cultural issue in Eastern Europe, as the author suggests, that's not an excuse. It's important to consider that racism isn't just about personal beliefs; it affects others and can create a hostile environment.\n\nThe friend's ultimatum is harsh, but the author's choice here has real consequences for his friend. Sticking with the girlfriend despite her racism might be seen as supporting her views, even if unintentionally. The author might be complicit if he doesn't take a stronger stance. \n\nI should also think about the friend's perspective. He's a Black person who's been close for three years, and he feels betrayed. The author's decision could harm their friendship. However, the author might feel that love and personal relationships should take precedence over this. But in reality, being in a relationship with someone who holds racist views can lead to ongoing conflict and hurt, not just for the author but for others around him.\n\nThe author mentions that Diana's racist comments are specific, like disliking Black people and not wanting to go to Africa. If these are the only instances, maybe the racism isn't overt. But it's still significant. The author's responsibility is to consider whose side he's on when it comes to standing against racism. \n\nSo, while the author is trying to address the issue, he might still be in the wrong by choosing to stay with a partner who holds those views instead of prioritizing his friend's feelings and the broader ethical implications. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
