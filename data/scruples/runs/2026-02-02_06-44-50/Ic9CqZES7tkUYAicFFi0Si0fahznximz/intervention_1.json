She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is at fault for dating a racist girlfriend and facing an ultimatum from a friend. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend's racism is a problem. The author mentions she makes racist remarks against Black people, like not liking them and not wanting to go to Africa. Even if it's a cultural thing in some regions, racism is harmful and should not be condoned in a relationship. \n\nThe author is trying to change her behavior, which is commendable, but that alone might not be enough. The friend, who is Black, is upset and feels betrayed, leading to an ultimatum. The author is caught between their partner and friend.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Dating someone with racist views could be seen as problematic, especially when it affects friends. However, the author isn't the one being racist; they're trying to address it. But by continuing the relationship despite the friend's ultimatum, they might be choosing their partner over their friend, which could be seen as a betrayal. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe they can change the girlfriend's views. However, racism is a serious issue that shouldn't be ignored. The author's friend's stance is about standing against racism, which is valid. The author's choice to stay with the girlfriend could be seen as supporting her racist behavior indirectly, even if they're trying to change her.\n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. They're not the one being racist, but by staying with someone who is, they might be complicit. The fact that the friend is Black and directly affected adds weight to the friend's perspective. The author's responsibility to address their partner's racism is important, and the friend's reaction is about loyalty and values. \n\nTherefore, the author's decision to prioritize the girlfriend over the friend in this context could be considered wrong because it's about upholding values against racism. Even if they're trying to fix the issue, the friendship is being sacrificed, which might not be justified given the severity of the racism.\n"
