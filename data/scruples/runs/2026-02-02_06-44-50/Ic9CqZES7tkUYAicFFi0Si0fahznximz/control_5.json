She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. So the situation is that the author is in a one-week relationship with a Ukrainian girl named Diana. The main issue is that Diana has racist views against Black people. The author's friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum: either break up with Diana or lose the friendship. The author is torn.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author mentions that Diana's racism is part of a cultural background, citing their dad's experiences in Russia with similar behavior. They also note that changing someone's racist views is hard and that they've tried to address it. The friend is pressuring the author to choose between the relationship and the friendship.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. The options are A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no). To decide, I should consider the ethical implications here. Dating someone who holds racist views can be problematic because it may involve supporting or condoning those views, especially if the person doesn't take steps to change. However, the author is actively trying to help Diana change, which shows they're not complicit. On the other hand, the friend's ultimatum is a separate issue. The author is being pressured to choose, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong for staying with Diana, especially if they believe they can work on the issue.\n\nBut is it wrong to date a racist person? It's a complex situation. If the person is being racist in a way that's harmful or offensive, the author might be enabling that behavior by being in the relationship. However, if they are genuinely trying to address it, maybe they're not entirely at fault. However, the author should consider whether they can tolerate or change someone's racist views. If the racism is deep-rooted and unchangeable, the author might be in a problematic situation, supporting someone with harmful beliefs.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's reaction is also extreme. Telling someone to choose between a partner and a friend because of the partner's racism is harsh. The author isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing their relationship, especially if they're making efforts to address the racism. However, the author should also reflect on whether they're making the right choice for themselves and not just the friend's sake.\n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the author is actively working to change the situation. Since the author is trying to get Diana to not be racist and is aware of the issue, they might not be entirely wrong. But if they ignore the racism and continue the relationship without addressing it, that could be problematic. In this case, the author is making an effort, so maybe they're not in the wrong. However, there's a line between trying to help someone change and being in a relationship with someone who holds harmful views. The answer could be B (no), but there's nuance here.\n"
