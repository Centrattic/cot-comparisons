She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author is dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana who is racist towards Black people. The author is trying to get her to stop being racist, especially around his friends and family. One of his friends, who is Kenyan, is upset and giving him an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue here. The author is in a relationship where one partner holds racist views. The user's friend is a Black person who feels betrayed and is setting a firm boundary. The author is caught between two people he cares about, but the friend is making a clear point that racism is a deal-breaker in their relationship. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for staying with the racist girlfriend despite the friend's objections. On one hand, the author might argue that he's trying to change her views, which is a long process. But on the other hand, supporting someone who holds racist beliefs can perpetuate those biases and harm others, especially when the author is aware of the impact.\n\nThe friend's stance is that \"brothers before hoes,\" which is a common phrase indicating loyalty to friends over romantic partners. However, the ethical consideration here is that racism is a serious issue. By choosing to stay with the girlfriend despite her racism, the author might be complicit in her behavior, even if he's trying to change her. The friend's reaction is understandable because being in a relationship with someone who is racist can feel like a betrayal, especially if the author is prioritizing the relationship over the friend's well-being.\n\nIt's important to note that the author isn't the racist one; he's the one in the relationship with the racist partner. His responsibility here is to acknowledge the harm his partner's racism causes and to take steps to address it. If he continues to support her without significant change, he might be enabling her behavior. The ultimatum from the friend is harsh, but it's a reflection of the severity of the issue from the friend's perspective. \n\nIn terms of cultural context, the author mentions that racism might be more prevalent in Eastern Europe, but that doesn't excuse it. Everyone has a responsibility to challenge harmful beliefs, even if they're culturally ingrained. The author's effort to change her views is good, but if those efforts aren't effective within a reasonable time, he might need to reconsider the relationship to avoid further harm to others.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is aware of his girlfriend's racism, is trying to change her, but the friend is being directly harmed by this. If the author continues the relationship despite knowing the harm, he's not in the right. The friend's ultimatum is a clear boundary, and the author's decision to stick with the girlfriend could be seen as prioritizing his romantic relationship over supporting a friend who is a victim of racism. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not taking a stand against his girlfriend's racism in a way that respects his friend's feelings.\n"
