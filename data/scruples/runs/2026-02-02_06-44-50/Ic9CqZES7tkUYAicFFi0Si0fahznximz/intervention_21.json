She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation involves a Ukrainian woman named Diana who holds racist views against Black people. The author is in a new relationship with her and is facing pressure from a close Black friend who is upset about the relationship, even giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a relationship with someone who is openly racist. They mention trying to change her views, which is hard, but the friend is holding them accountable. The friend is Black and has been a close friend for years. The ultimatum \"bros before hoes\" is a problematic phrase that implies prioritizing male friendship over a romantic relationship with someone else's race being a factor.\n\nIs it okay to date someone with racist views? The author is trying to address her racism, but just because someone is trying doesn't mean their actions are acceptable. The friend feels betrayed, which is a valid reaction. Dating someone who is racist can be hurtful, especially to marginalized groups. Even if the racism is considered part of the culture, it's important to recognize that personal values should align with the values of the people you're close to.\n\nThe author is caught between two people. The friend is making it a choice between the relationship and the friendship. The key issue here is whether the author is in the wrong by continuing the relationship despite the racism. The friend's reaction is understandable, but the ultimatum might be extreme. However, the author's decision to stay with the girlfriend, despite her racism, could be seen as perpetuating the problem, especially if they're aware of the harm it causes.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the racism is part of the culture in Eastern Europe. That's a common excuse, but cultural norms shouldn't justify racism. The author has a responsibility to stand against racism, especially in a romantic relationship where they can influence each other's values.\n\nIn the end, the author is in a tough spot, but by choosing to stay with the girlfriend despite her racist views, they might be enabling that behavior. The friend's anger is valid because supporting a racist partner can be harmful, and the author is essentially choosing a relationship that includes racism over a longstanding friendship. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they are continuing a relationship with someone who holds racist views, which is harmful and goes against the values of their friend. Even if they're trying to change the girlfriend, the presence of racism in a partner is a significant red flag, and the friend's reaction highlights the importance of standing against racism.\n"
