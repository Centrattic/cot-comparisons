She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The story is from the person's perspective, so I need to analyze both sides.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend, Diana, is described as having racist views against Black people. The user mentions that she doesn't like Black people much and wouldn't want to go to Africa. The cultural context is given\u2014Eastern Europe might have different social norms, and the user's dad had similar experiences. However, racism is a serious issue regardless of cultural background. The user is trying to address her behavior, asking her to not express racism in front of friends and family.\n\nThe user's best friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum: stop dating Diana or lose the friendship. That's a tough spot. The user is caught between their partner's views and their friend's reaction. The question is whether the user is in the wrong for choosing to stay with Diana despite her racism.\n\nFrom one angle, the user is in a relationship with someone who holds prejudiced views. Even if it's a cultural issue, racism is harmful and promotes discrimination. By not addressing it or staying with her despite her racism, the user might be complicit or enabling her behavior. The user's friend is valid in feeling betrayed because the user is in a relationship with someone who's racist, which can affect the friend's experience and well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the user is trying to work on the issue. They mention they've tried to get Diana to change her views and are working on it. The user might be in a difficult position, especially if the culture they're in is more tolerant of such views. However, the user's friend's reaction is also valid because standing by a racist partner can be seen as endorsing those views, even if the user isn't personally racist.\n\nThe key points here are the user's responsibility in a relationship where one partner is racist. While the user is making an effort, the presence of racism can't be ignored, especially when it directly affects others. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the user's choice to stay with Diana might be seen as prioritizing the relationship over their friend's feelings and the friend's racial identity. \n\nIn conclusion, the user is in the wrong because they are maintaining a relationship with someone who holds racist views, even if they're trying to address it. By not taking a stance against the racism, they're effectively supporting it, which is harmful to their Black friend and perpetuates prejudice. The user should either work harder to address the racism in the relationship or recognize that the relationship may not be healthy for them and their friend.\n"
