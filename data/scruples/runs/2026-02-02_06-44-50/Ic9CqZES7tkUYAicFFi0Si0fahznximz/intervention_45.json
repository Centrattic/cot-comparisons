She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The author is defending their relationship with Diana, a Ukrainian girl he's been dating for a week. The main issue is her racism towards Black people.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the severity of the racism. The author mentions that Diana doesn't like Black people and wouldn't want to go to Africa. She's also made offensive remarks. The key point here is that the author is aware of her racism but is choosing to stay in the relationship despite this. \n\nThen there's the friend who is black and is upset. The friend is demanding an ultimatum: choose between the friend or the girlfriend. The author is trying to mediate, but the friend isn't budging. The author is caught in the middle, but the main question is whether he's wrong for continuing the relationship.\n\nRacism is a serious issue. Even if it's a cultural thing, as the author suggests, it's not acceptable. The fact that the author is trying to change her behavior is good, but it's also important to recognize that systemic and individual racism require more than just personal effort. The girlfriend's views are harmful and can affect others, especially the Black friend who feels betrayed.\n\nThe author might be in denial about the situation. A week into the relationship, it's possible that he's not fully aware of the extent of her racism. However, the fact that he's aware of her remarks and is still choosing to stay with her, despite the friend's ultimatum, suggests that he's prioritizing the relationship over standing against racism. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to respect each other's values. If the author truly values equality and anti-racism, dating someone who holds such views is contradictory. The author might not be a racist himself, but by being in a relationship with someone who is, he's enabling her behavior. \n\nThe friend's ultimatum is harsh, but the author's decision to stay with the girlfriend in the face of such a clear issue could be seen as being in the wrong. The author is not taking a stand against racism, which is a significant ethical issue. So, considering all these points, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong for continuing the relationship despite knowing about her racism.\n"
