She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that the author is in a relationship with a Ukrainian girl named Diana who holds racist views against Black people. The author likes her a lot but is facing pressure from a friend who is Black and is upset about the relationship. The friend gave an ultimatum: either end the relationship or lose the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend is racist, which is a serious issue. The author is trying to address her behavior by encouraging her to stop being racist, which is commendable, but the girlfriend hasn't changed. The friend feels betrayed and is making an ultimatum. The author is conflicted between the two.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, supporting racism is unacceptable. If the girlfriend is making racist comments and the author continues the relationship without taking a stand against her views, that could be seen as enabling or condoning the racism. However, the author is trying to change her perspective, which shows some effort to address the issue. But the girlfriend hasn't changed, and the author might be in a relationship with someone who holds prejudiced views despite knowing the harm it causes.\n\nThe friend's reaction is also a factor. The friend feels that the author is betraying him by dating someone racist. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is a problematic way to handle the situation, as it reduces complex issues to a simple choice. However, the friend's concern is valid because supporting racism is harmful. The author is caught between two difficult choices, but the core issue is the girlfriend's racism.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be in the wrong if they are aware of the racism and continue the relationship without taking decisive action to distance themselves from the harmful behavior. Relationships should ideally be based on mutual respect and shared values, and racism is a significant issue that can't be ignored. The author's decision to stay in the relationship despite the racism could be seen as complicit.\n\nBut there's also the cultural context mentioned\u2014Eastern European countries may have different attitudes, but that doesn't excuse racism. The author's effort to change her is good, but if the girlfriend isn't willing to change, the author might be staying in a relationship that's harmful to others. The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but the underlying issue is valid. The author's choice to prioritize the girlfriend over the friend could be seen as wrong because they are enabling racism, even if they're trying to address it.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is in a tough spot, but their decision to stay with the girlfriend despite her racism could be considered wrong because it perpetuates a harmful environment. The answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
