She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is dating a Ukrainian woman named Diana, who is racist against Black people. The author mentions that racism is more culturally accepted in Eastern Europe and that they've tried to address it. However, the girlfriend's racism is causing tension, especially with the author's friend, who is Black and is making an ultimatum between the friendship and the relationship.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nLet me consider the key points. The girlfriend's racism is a significant issue. The author is trying to address it, which is commendable, but racism is a serious problem. The friend is upset and has given an ultimatum, which adds pressure. The author is caught between two important relationships and is trying to navigate the situation.\n\nNow, from an ethical standpoint, supporting a racist relationship can be problematic. Even if the racism is part of the culture, the author is in a position where they can and should address this. However, the author is not the one being racist; they are the one trying to change their partner's views. But the partner isn't changing, and the author is facing external pressure from friends.\n\nIs the author at fault for being in a relationship with a racist person? Well, the author isn't the racist one, but they are choosing to remain in a relationship with someone who is. The question is whether the author is responsible for the partner's racism. If the partner is not changing despite efforts, then the author's choice to stay might be seen as enabling the racism. However, the author is trying to address it, which shows they are not complicit. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's ultimatum is harsh. The friend is making a choice based on the author's relationship, which could be seen as unfair. But the friend is a victim of the racism, so their feelings are valid. The author is caught in the middle, trying to maintain both relationships. \n\nIn this case, the author is trying to do the right thing by addressing the racism. They are not the one being racist. The friend's ultimatum is the problem here, not the author. So the author isn't in the wrong for choosing to stay with their girlfriend, especially if they are making efforts to address the issue. However, if the author is not actively supporting the racist behavior and is trying to change it, they are not at fault. \n\nBut wait, if the author is aware that the partner is racist and is choosing to stay in the relationship despite the partner's harmful beliefs, maybe the author is complicit by not leaving. However, changing someone's deep-seated beliefs is difficult, and the author is making an effort. So the fault might not lie with the author. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong because they are the one trying to address the racism. The girlfriend's racism is the issue, and the friend's ultimatum is the problem. The author's choice to stay in the relationship while working on the issue is not their fault. So the answer is B (No).\n"
