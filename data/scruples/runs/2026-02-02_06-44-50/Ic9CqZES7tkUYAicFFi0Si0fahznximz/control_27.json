She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a girl they know is racist. The author likes the girl a lot and is happy with her, but she's racist against Black people. The author is trying to get her to stop being racist, but their friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a relationship with someone who holds racist views. Even if it's a cultural thing in her background, racism is a serious issue. The fact that the author is trying to encourage her to change is a good step, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong for staying with her despite her racism.\n\nOn one hand, the author might not be directly responsible for her racism, as it's part of her upbringing. But by continuing the relationship, the author could be seen as accepting or enabling those views. The friend's reaction is about loyalty and values\u2014supporting a friend who is in a relationship with someone who dislikes another racial group can be hurtful. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but his concern is valid because racism affects people's lives deeply.\n\nThe author is caught between two important relationships. However, the core issue is whether staying in a relationship with someone who is racist is acceptable. Even if the author is trying to change the situation, the presence of racism in a partner can be a deal-breaker for others, especially those directly affected. The author's decision to stay with the girlfriend might be seen as prioritizing their happiness over their friend's feelings and the broader issue of racism.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author isn't directly racist themselves, but by not ending the relationship despite knowing the girlfriend's views, they might be complicit. The friend's anger is about being betrayed because the author isn't standing up against racism. The author's choice to continue the relationship could be seen as supporting or accepting the racism, even if unintentionally. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong for not taking a firmer stance against racism in their partner, thereby causing harm to their friend's feelings and relationships.\n"
