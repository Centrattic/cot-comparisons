She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend and facing an ultimatum from a friend. \n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend, Diana, is described as being racist against Black people. The author mentions that this is a cultural issue in Eastern Europe and that he's tried to address her racism. However, she still makes offensive remarks. \n\nThe author's friend, who is Black and a close friend for three years, is upset and giving an ultimatum: stop dating Diana or lose the friendship. The author is conflicted, trying to maintain both relationships, but the friend is using the phrase \"bros before hoes,\" which is a problematic statement in itself.\n\nNow, the key points here. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting someone who holds racist views can be harmful. The author is aware of her racism and is trying to address it, but it's not enough for his friend. The friend is standing up against being betrayed, which is valid. The author is in a position where he's choosing between his partner's behavior and his friendship. \n\nEven though the author is trying to change her, the fact remains that he's in a relationship with someone who expresses racism. If he truly supports anti-racism, he might need to consider whether staying in the relationship is the right choice. The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but the author's decision to prioritize the girlfriend over his friend's well-being could be seen as supporting the racist views indirectly. \n\nHowever, the author isn't the one being racist; he's in a relationship with someone who is. But by not ending the relationship despite her harmful beliefs, he might be complicit. The line between being in the wrong and being in a difficult situation is blurry here. \n\nThe friend's approach is aggressive, but the author's stance is to continue the relationship. The question is whether staying with the girlfriend makes him complicit. The author's actions could be seen as allowing racism to persist, even if he's trying to change her. So, the answer hinges on whether complicity in racism, even unintentionally, makes him wrong.\n"
