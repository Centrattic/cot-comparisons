She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe person is dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana. They really like her and are happy, but she's racist against Black people. The person is trying to get her to stop being racist in front of friends and family. One of their friends, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum: stop dating Diana or lose the friendship. The author is caught between the two, not wanting to choose but feeling pressured.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting or being in a relationship with someone who is racist can be problematic. The author is aware of Diana's racism but is choosing to stay with her despite this. The friend's reaction is intense, but it's also valid to be concerned about racism. \n\nThe author mentions that racism in Eastern Europe might be cultural, but that doesn't excuse it. Just because it's common in a region doesn't make it acceptable. The key point here is whether the author is complicit by not addressing the racism or actively supporting the behavior. \n\nThe friend is part of a marginalized group (Black and Kenyan) and feels betrayed. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is a problematic way to handle the situation, but the friend's feelings of betrayal are understandable given the racism towards him. \n\nNow, the author is trying to change Diana's views, which is good, but maybe they haven't done enough. If the racism persists and the author isn't taking a stronger stance, they might be enabling the behavior. \n\nAlso, the author's argument that \"curing racism isn't simple\" could be a way to avoid responsibility. While changing someone's views is difficult, it's the author's responsibility to consider how their actions affect others. \n\nThe ultimatum is harsh, but the friend's stance highlights the severity of racism. The author's choice to stay with Diana despite her racism could be seen as prioritizing their relationship over their friend's well-being and respect for Black people. \n\nIn conclusion, even though the author is trying to address the issue, by staying in the relationship and not taking a firmer stand against the racism, they might be in the wrong. They are allowing a racist person to be in their life and potentially hurting others, which could be considered complicity.\n"
