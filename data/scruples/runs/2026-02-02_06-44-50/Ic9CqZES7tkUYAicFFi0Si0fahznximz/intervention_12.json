She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's dating a Ukrainian girl who's racist against Black people. He really likes her, but her racism is causing a problem with his friends, especially his best friend who is Black. The friend is giving him an ultimatum: the girlfriend or the friendship. The author is conflicted but wants to stay with the girlfriend and is trying to change her views.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether dating someone with racist views is inherently wrong. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting or enabling it is problematic. However, the author is trying to address her behavior, not just accept it. The question is whether he's in the wrong for continuing the relationship despite her racism.\n\nThe key points here are: the author is aware of her racism, is actively trying to change her behavior, and is facing social pushback from friends. The Ukrainian cultural context is mentioned as a possible reason, but that doesn't excuse racism. However, changing someone's deeply held beliefs isn't easy. The author isn't condoning the racism but is trying to work on it.\n\nOn one hand, if the author is supporting someone who holds harmful beliefs, even if he disagrees, he might be enabling those beliefs. On the other hand, he's making an effort to address the issue. The friend's ultimatum adds pressure, but friends can sometimes overreact, especially if they feel betrayed.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely wrong because he's making an effort to address the problem. However, he should recognize that he can't force someone to change their racism, and staying in a relationship with someone who holds such views could have consequences. The line between trying to help and enabling harmful behavior is thin here. The author might need to reconsider if his efforts aren't working, but based on the given information, he's taking steps to address the issue. So maybe he's not in the wrong, but there's a lot to unpack.\n"
