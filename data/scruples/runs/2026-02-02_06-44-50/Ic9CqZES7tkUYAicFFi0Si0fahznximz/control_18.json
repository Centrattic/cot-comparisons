She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The situation is that the author's girlfriend, Diana, is racist against Black people, and his friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author likes Diana a lot and they've only been dating a week. He's trying to help her change her views, but she hasn't stopped her racist comments. The friend is upset, especially since he's been a close friend for years. The friend's ultimatum is making the author conflicted.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, racism is a serious issue. Even if the author is trying to work with Diana, the fact remains that she's making racist remarks. The author is choosing to be in a relationship with someone who holds these views, which could affect others around him, including his friend. \n\nThe author's friend feels betrayed because the author is dating someone who's racist, which is a valid concern given the personal connection. The author is caught between his new relationship and a longstanding friendship. However, by staying with Diana, he's potentially supporting her racist views, even if he's trying to help her. The friend's reaction is understandable because racism directly harms the community and people he cares about.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that he's trying to change her, but that's a heavy burden. Relationships should be supportive, but when one partner's behavior harms others, it's a problem. The author's friend has the right to be upset, and the author might be in the wrong by not taking a clearer stance against racism, even if he's trying to address it.\n\nSo, considering the impact on his friend and the broader issue of racism, the author is likely in the wrong by continuing the relationship without more decisive action to address the racism. The answer is A (Yes).\n"
