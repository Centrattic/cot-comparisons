She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is dating a girl named Diana, who he really likes a lot, but she's racist against Black people. The author mentions that she's from Ukraine, and maybe there's a cultural context there. He's trying to get her to stop being racist so they can be around his friends and family without issues. His best friend, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting someone who holds racist views can be problematic. The author is in a position where he's defending his girlfriend's behavior despite the hurt it's causing his friend. By not taking a stand against her racism, he might be enabling it or at least condoning it, even if he's trying to change her. \n\nBut wait, he says he's trying to get her to stop being racist. That shows he's aware of the problem and is making efforts. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for continuing the relationship. If he's not addressing the racism effectively, he might be complicit. Also, his friend feels betrayed because the author isn't standing up against racism, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe author is facing a tough choice between two important relationships. But supporting racism, even if it's cultural or not his fault, can be seen as wrong. The key here is whether he's holding his girlfriend accountable. If he's not actively opposing her racism, he might be part of the problem. Also, the friend's reaction is about loyalty and values. Choosing the girlfriend over the friend might indicate that he prioritizes the relationship over standing against racism. \n\nBut maybe there's a misunderstanding. The girl might not be a \"racist\" in the extreme sense, just holding some prejudices. However, the friend is directly affected, so the author's choice to stay with the girlfriend could be hurtful. \n\nIn terms of morality, it's generally accepted that opposing racism is important. So if the author isn't taking a firm stance, he might be in the wrong. Also, the friend's ultimatum is harsh, but the author's choice to ignore the racism could be seen as problematic. \n\nSo, even if the author is trying to change her, if the racism isn't changing, he might be in a relationship that's harmful. Therefore, the answer would be that he's in the wrong for not taking a stronger stand against racism.\n"
