She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for buying their pregnant wife a prenatal yoga pass. The wife has hypermesis, which is severe morning sickness, and she's on temporary disability. She's been staying in bed a lot, going to the hospital for IVs. The husband thought she might benefit from exercise and getting out, so he got her yoga. But she was upset, called it rude, and her friends agreed.\n\nHmm. So the husband's intention was good, right? He wanted her to feel better by exercising and socializing. But the wife is really sick, to the point of needing medical attention. She might not be in a state to do yoga. Even if the yoga is prenatal, maybe she's too unwell for any physical activity. The husband didn't consult her about it first, which could be a problem. Maybe she's been advised not to exercise by her doctor? The husband's lack of communication here is an issue. Even if the intention was good, not discussing his idea with her first might have made her feel unheard. Also, she was critical of the gift, and her friends supported her. So maybe the husband was tone-deaf. But the question is if he's in the wrong. Did he overstep? I think the key points are her current health condition and not consulting her. Even if he thought it was a good idea, not considering her actual state and not checking with her first could be seen as wrong. So maybe answer A.\n"
