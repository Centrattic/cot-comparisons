She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about buying a yoga pass for a pregnant wife with hypermesis. The wife is on temporary disability, stays in bed, and gets IV fluids. The husband thinks exercise would help her depression from missing work. The wife felt the gift was rude and \"tone deaf,\" and her friends agreed he's an asshole.\n\nHmm. The husband's intention was good\u2014he wanted to help her feel better through yoga. But hypermesis is a severe condition. Even though he researched prenatal yoga, maybe he didn't consider how she's currently feeling. If she's too sick to leave the house except for medical appointments, yoga might be too much. The wife might feel like he's dismissing her condition by thinking she can just do yoga. Also, she didn't say thanks, which he noticed. Maybe she's embarrassed or frustrated. The friends agreeing with her suggests others see the sensitivity. So even if his intentions were good, he might not have thought about her current health limitations and emotional state. So maybe the answer is A, he's in the wrong.\n"
