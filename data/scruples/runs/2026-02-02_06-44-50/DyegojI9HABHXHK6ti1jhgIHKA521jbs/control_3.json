She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if the person who bought their pregnant wife a prenatal yoga pass for her birthday is in the wrong. The wife has hypermesis, which is severe morning sickness, and is on temporary disability. She's been staying in bed and only going to the hospital for IV fluids. The husband thought exercise and fresh air might help her depression from missing work, so he got her yoga classes. But she was upset, thinking it was a \"rude\" and tone-deaf present.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the husband's intentions. He wanted to help her by encouraging physical activity and getting her out of the house. Prenatal yoga is generally safe, but in her current state, maybe she's too unwell. However, he did research and got a prenatal yoga pass, so that's a good point.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife is extremely sick, with severe symptoms that prevent her from doing much. She might feel that the gift is insensitive because she can't even attend the classes right now. Her friends agreed with her, suggesting that the gesture came off as dismissive of her condition. The husband's assumption that she needs to exercise might overlook her actual needs, especially if she's already getting medical treatment for dehydration and vitamin deficiencies.\n\nThe key here is empathy. Even if the husband's intention was good, the timing and appropriateness of the gift matter. The wife might be feeling physically incapable of doing yoga and emotionally hurt that her partner didn't consider her current state. The friends' reaction also indicates that the gift was perceived negatively. The husband might not realize how severe her condition is, but he should have checked in with her before getting the gift instead of assuming she'd want to take it up. \n\nSo, while the intention was to help, the action might have been ill-timed and not in tune with her needs. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not considering her current health situation and the emotional impact of the gift.\n"
