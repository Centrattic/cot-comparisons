She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author bought their pregnant wife a prenatal yoga pass for her birthday. The wife has hypermesis, which is severe morning sickness that's causing her a lot of discomfort. She's on temporary disability, stays in bed, and only goes out for medical treatment. The author thought she might benefit from exercise and fresh air, hence the yoga pass. But the wife was upset, thinking the gift was insensitive and rude, and even her friends agreed with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the wife's health condition. Hypermesis is pretty serious, leading to dehydration and needing IV fluids. If she's that unwell, maybe she's not in a position to do yoga. The author's intention was good\u2014to help with depression and encourage activity\u2014but maybe they didn't consider the severity of her symptoms. The wife might feel that the gift is dismissive of her current condition. She's stuck in bed, and suggesting yoga might make her feel like her illness isn't being taken seriously. \n\nThe author thought she might miss her job and wanted her to leave the house. However, if she's too sick to even go to the hospital, yoga might not be feasible. The wife's reaction was a \"look\" and not thanking him, which shows she felt the gift was inappropriate. The author's friends also criticized him, which adds to the idea that maybe the gift was tone-deaf. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to help her feel better. The question is whether the intention matters or if the action itself was insensitive given the circumstances. The wife's perspective is that she's too sick for yoga, and the gift makes her feel like her husband isn't acknowledging her suffering. The author might not have realized how bad her condition is, but he did know she's on bed rest and only going out for medical reasons. Maybe he didn't do enough research into her current state before choosing the gift. \n\nSo, the key points are: the wife's severe health condition, the appropriateness of the gift considering her symptoms, the author's intentions, and the wife's and her friends' reactions. The author might have good intentions, but the gift could be seen as not considering her current limitations. Even if he thought yoga would help her depression, if she's physically unable to do it due to her illness, the gift is not helpful and might be hurtful. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering her actual health status when choosing the gift.\n"
