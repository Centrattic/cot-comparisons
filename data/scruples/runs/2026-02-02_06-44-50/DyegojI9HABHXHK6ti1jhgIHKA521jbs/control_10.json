She has a something called hypermesis which is \"morning sickness\" all the time, even waking up in the middle of the night to vomit.   I told her to ask her doctor for a medical leave so she is currently on temporary disability.  She stays in bed most of the day and only leaves the house to go to the hospital where she gets IV fluids for dehydration/vitamin deficiency.     \nI know I always feel better when I exercise and it helps with depression.  I think she is getting depressed because she misses her job.  I think she should leave the house and get some fresh air and stretch, so I got her a yoga pass for her birthday.   I researched local studios and found one that had prenatal yoga.   When she got the email gift certificate while I was at work, she didn't call to say thank you.  When I got home, I asked her if she got the email and she just gave me a look.  I could tell she didn't like my present.  She says she is too sick to do yoga.   Ok, maybe.   She thinks it is a rude present and that I am \"tone deaf.\"  I can get her another present...don't know what.   I don't think my present makes me a bad person, though.   She might feel better soon and want to take yoga classes.  She told her friends about it and they agreed with her that I am being an asshole.  I think it is rude to be so critical of my present.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author bought their pregnant wife a prenatal yoga pass for her birthday. The wife is 16 weeks pregnant and has hypermesis, which is severe morning sickness all the time. She's on temporary disability, stays in bed most of the day, and only goes out for hospital visits. The author thought that exercise might help her depression from missing her job and wanted her to get fresh air and stretch. However, the wife didn't like the gift, found it rude, and her friends agreed she was right. The author is confused because they think the present is well-intentioned.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the wife's health condition and her reaction. Hypermesis is serious; she can't even keep food down and needs IV fluids. She's already not leaving the house much except for medical reasons. The author might not realize how severe her condition is. Even though prenatal yoga is a thing, if she's too sick to leave bed most of the time, yoga might not be feasible. The wife's friends think the author is an asshole, which suggests that maybe the gesture was insensitive. The author might have good intentions, but maybe they didn't consider her current state. It's possible the wife feels like the author is minimizing her condition by suggesting yoga. So even if the intention was to help, the action might have been inappropriate given her current health. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider her actual condition and how the gift could come off as dismissive of her illness.\n"
