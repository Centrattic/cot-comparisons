      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. The situation involves revealing past infidelity to a current partner.\n\nFirst, the ex cheated on the author with a gym buddy, which was discovered through a friend. The author confronted the ex, they broke up, and now the ex stole the author's friends. The author found out the ex is dating someone new and sent an email to the new boyfriend about the cheating. The new boyfriend broke up with the ex because of this info. Now, the ex and her friends (who believe her over the author) are calling the author an asshole.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author have the right to share this information? The author's reasoning was that they would want to know if their partner had cheated before. But was it their place to act as a gatekeeper for the new relationship?\n\nLegally, there's no law against sharing information, even if it's personal, unless it's defamatory. But this is more about moral or social judgment. The ex is now in a new relationship, and the author's action might be seen as interfering. The new boyfriend might have a right to know about his partner's past, but the author could be seen as overstepping by directly contacting him without the ex's consent.\n\nThe author's motivation was to prevent the new boyfriend from being hurt, but this could be considered a breach of privacy. The ex's friends supporting her might be because they don't know the whole story, which the author tried to share. However, inserting oneself into another person's relationship, even with good intentions, can be seen as meddling.\n\nIn relationships, people often have different boundaries. While the author might have valid reasons, the method of sharing such information without the ex's consent and directly to a third party could be problematic. The new boyfriend has the right to hear the information from his partner directly, not from an ex. So, by contacting him, the author might have crossed a line, even if the information was truthful.\n\nTherefore, the author's action, while perhaps well-intentioned, could be seen as the wrong thing to do because it involved interfering in another relationship without permission. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
