      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's ex cheated on them with a gym buddy. The author found out from a friend, confronted her, they broke up, and the ex ended up stealing friends. Now, the ex is dating a new guy. The author, wanting the BF to know the truth, sent an email. The BF broke up with the ex as a result. Now, the ex and friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author have the right to inform the new BF about the cheating? The author's reasoning is that they would want to know if their new partner had cheated. But is that a valid justification?\n\nLegally, there's no law against telling someone the truth about a past partner. But ethically, it's trickier. The author did have a personal stake in the matter, but sharing that information with the new BF might be seen as interfering in their relationship. However, the BF might appreciate knowing the truth. \n\nOn the other hand, the author sent the email privately, not publicly shaming the ex, but directly informing the BF. The ex's friends, who were taken in by her story, now side with her against the author. The author might argue they were protecting themselves and others from someone who's dishonest.\n\nBut did the author cross a line? Maybe. The BF had the right to know, but the author's actions could be seen as meddling. However, the ex had already cheated and lied, so the author might feel justified. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often have mixed reactions. Some might say it's right to warn someone about a cheating partner, others might say it's none of their business. Since the author isn't the BF, they might have overstepped. But considering the ex's actions, their intent might be seen as protective.\n\nSo, the author's intent was to inform someone who could be affected by the ex's past. The outcome was the BF breaking up with her, which might be a good outcome. The author isn't in the wrong as they acted on a desire to share the truth, even if it's personal. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
