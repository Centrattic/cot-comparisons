It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy.

I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong for telling the ex's new boyfriend about her cheating.\n\nFirst, the author's ex cheated on them with a gym buddy. The author found out through a friend and confronted the ex, leading to a breakup. Now, five months later, the ex is in a new relationship. The author sent an email to the new boyfriend about the cheating, which led to the new boyfriend breaking up with her. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they would want to know if their partner had cheated before. But the issue here is that the author didn't go through the new boyfriend's permission or the ex's consent. The ex's new partner has a right to know, but the method of disclosure might be questionable. \n\nHowever, the author is taking it upon themselves to share private information that could be considered confidential. Even though the cheating is a valid concern, the author is essentially interfering in the new relationship. The ex might have moved on, and the author's actions could be seen as overstepping by not letting the new boyfriend find out through the ex's own disclosure. \n\nAlso, the author's friends still believe the ex's version of events, which complicates things further. The author might feel vindicated, but sharing such information could be seen as manipulative or vengeful, especially if it's out of spite from the breakup. \n\nOn the other hand, the new boyfriend has a right to know about his partner's past, but the author's approach might have been more direct than necessary. Maybe they should have advised the ex to disclose it herself instead of doing it themselves. \n\nIn many cases, people are advised to let the person in question tell their own story. By acting as a third party, the author is taking away the ex's responsibility to be honest. This could be seen as crossing a boundary, even if the information is true. \n\nThe key points here are consent and method. The author didn't ask the ex if she wanted them to share the information, and they did it directly to the new boyfriend. This could be viewed as interfering in someone else's relationship without justification. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they shared personal information about their ex with a new partner without her consent, which can be seen as a violation of privacy, even if the content of the information is negative. The right approach would have been to let the ex handle it or to perhaps communicate it through her, not directly to the new boyfriend.\n"
