I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's ex cheated on them with a gym buddy, and after finding out, they broke up. Now the ex is dating someone new, and the author emailed the new boyfriend to tell him about the cheating. The new guy broke up with the ex because of this, and now the author is getting called an asshole by their ex-friends who side with the ex.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Tattling or informing someone about their partner's past can be a gray area. The author's reasoning is that they would want to know if their new partner cheated on a previous relationship. That makes sense as a motive, but does it justify the action?\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel they're doing the right thing by preventing the new boyfriend from being cheated on. But on the other hand, the author might be overstepping by revealing private information after the fact. The ex cheated, but once the relationship is over, what's the responsibility of the ex-partner in informing the next partner? There's no legal obligation, but morally, it's debatable.\n\nAnother angle: the author's method of communication. They sent an email to the new boyfriend without knowing how he would react. This might have caused unnecessary harm, especially if the new boyfriend valued his partner's honesty and felt lied to. But the ex had indeed cheated, so the information is factual.\n\nHowever, the author's actions might have been vindictive or a way to get back at the ex for stealing friends. The ex's friends don't believe the author's side, so maybe the author is seeking revenge by damaging the ex's new relationship. That could be a problem because it's not about protecting the new boyfriend but about hurting the ex.\n\nAlso, considering privacy and consent. The author is sharing private information (cheating) without the ex's approval, which could be seen as a breach of privacy. Even if the information is true, spreading it could be harmful. Relationships have boundaries, and once a relationship ends, what is appropriate to share about the past?\n\nIn some contexts, it's common to share a partner's past infidelity if directly asked, but proactively telling someone without their partner's knowledge might be crossing a line. The new boyfriend might have wanted to hear this from his partner herself rather than from an ex. The author's actions may have undermined the new relationship's trust and autonomy.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's intentions might be to protect the new boyfriend, but the method and timing could be problematic. It's possible the author is in the wrong for violating the ex's privacy and interfering in a new relationship out of spite. Alternatively, if the author believes they're preventing another person from being hurt, they might not be in the wrong. But the key issue here is whether the author overstepped by sharing the information without the ex's consent and possibly for personal reasons.\n"
