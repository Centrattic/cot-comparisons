I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about telling an ex's new boyfriend that the ex cheated. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The ex cheated, the author found out through a friend, confronted her, they broke up, and then later the author emailed the new BF with the info. The result is that the new BF broke up with the ex, and now the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know the opinion. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nSo, what's the ethical angle here? The author had a valid reason to be upset because they were cheated on. But sharing that information with the new partner might be considered a violation of privacy. Even though the author might feel they're doing the right thing by warning the new BF, it's not the author's place to do so. The ex's past is between her and her new partner. The author is taking revenge, perhaps, or trying to even the score.\n\nBut is it right to expose someone's past to a new partner without their consent? Generally, people have the right to privacy, even if they've done something wrong. The author might have felt justified, but sharing that info without the ex's permission could be seen as malicious. Plus, the author's actions led to the new BF breaking up with the ex, which might have been intended as a form of retaliation. \n\nAlso, the author's ex and her friends don't believe the author's side, which complicates things. The author might be seeking validation or trying to correct the narrative. However, the method they used\u2014emailing the new BF directly\u2014was intrusive and not a private matter. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, even if the ex cheated, the author's action of informing the new partner without consent is generally considered wrong. It's meddling in someone else's relationship and could be seen as a breach of trust and privacy. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
