I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by telling the ex's new boyfriend about the cheating. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's ex cheated on them, which led to a breakup. Now, the ex is dating someone new. The author found out through a friend and decided to email the new boyfriend about the cheating. The result was the new boyfriend broke up with the ex because of the email. The ex and others are now calling the author an asshole, and the author's former friends (who were taken by the ex) side with the ex.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. So, the question is whether the author acted wrongly. Let's consider the ethical aspects here.\n\nOn one hand, the author had been wronged by the ex's infidelity. They might feel a need to protect the new boyfriend from being hurt in the same way. The author's reasoning is that if their situation were reversed, they'd want to know their partner had cheated. So, they might see this as a warning to prevent the new relationship from suffering the same fate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't go through the ex to inform the new boyfriend. Instead, they went directly to the new boyfriend, which could be seen as interfering in the new relationship. The ex had the right to disclose her past on her own terms. By doing this, the author might have breached trust and privacy. Even though the information is true, sharing it without the ex's consent could be considered an invasion of privacy, especially since the new boyfriend has a right to hear about his partner's past from her directly.\n\nAlso, the author's actions led to the breakup of the new relationship, which might have been unnecessary. The new boyfriend could have made a decision based on the information from the ex herself, but now the outcome is different because the author intervened. This could be seen as meddling in someone else's relationship, which is generally frowned upon.\n\nAdditionally, the ex and the author's former friends are now against the author, which complicates things. The ex's side is being supported by others, which the author might not have anticipated. The author's friends who were taken in might not know the full story, but the author's direct approach might have made it harder for others to see their perspective.\n\nSo, considering all these points, while the author had a valid grievance, the method of addressing it by directly informing the new boyfriend without the ex's consent might be seen as crossing a line. The right to privacy and the autonomy of the ex to disclose her own past with her new partner are important factors here. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for intervening in that way.\n"
