I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that the ex cheated, they broke up, and then the author told the new boyfriend, leading to the breakup and some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author found out their ex cheated through a friend, confronted her, ended the relationship, and then later told the new boyfriend about the cheating. Now the ex and others are calling the author an asshole.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, from a moral standpoint, is it right to share someone's private information, even if it's about cheating? The author's reasoning was that they would want to know if their new partner cheated before. But does that justify sharing the information without the ex's consent?\n\nThere's a difference between sharing information for personal reasons and acting in the interest of someone else. The author sent the email to the new boyfriend, which could be seen as interfering in someone else's relationship. Even if the information is true, spreading it might be considered a violation of privacy or an act of revenge.\n\nAlso, the author's actions led to the new relationship ending, which could be seen as a negative consequence. The ex and friends are upset, and the author's friends might not have the full context. The author might be justified in their feelings but acted in a way that's not constructive.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex did cheat, which is a valid reason for the breakup. However, the author's method of handling it could be questioned. Instead of contacting the new boyfriend directly, maybe the author should have focused on moving on and not interfering. Sharing such information could be seen as meddling, regardless of the truth.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, even if the author had a valid grievance, the action of informing the new boyfriend without a proper reason (like being asked directly) is likely crossing a boundary. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
