It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy.

I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. So, first, I need to analyze the situation step by step.\n\nThe ex cheated on them with a gym buddy, which was discovered through a friend. They confronted the ex, she admitted it, and they broke up. Now, five months later, the ex has a new boyfriend. The person in question sent an email to the new boyfriend about the cheating, leading to a breakup between the ex and her new BF. Now the ex and her friends are calling the person an asshole.\n\nThe main question is whether the action of informing the new boyfriend was wrong. Let's think about the factors here. On one hand, the person is trying to protect the new boyfriend from being cheated on again, which might be a noble intention. They might believe that the new BF has a right to know about the ex's past behavior. On the other hand, the person isn't the ex's current partner, so they might be overstepping their boundaries. Also, there's the issue of privacy\u2014should someone be allowed to share past cheating incidents with another person's partner?\n\nLegal and ethical considerations: In many places, there's no legal right to privacy in past relationships, but there are ethical boundaries. Telling someone else about a former partner's infidelity could be seen as interfering in another relationship. The person might be justified in wanting to prevent someone else from being hurt, but it's also possible that they're acting out of spite or holding onto the past. \n\nThe consequences: The new BF broke up with the ex because of this information. The ex is upset, and the person's former friends who now side with the ex believe the ex's story. The person's actions have caused conflict and possibly harmed relationships. \n\nAnother angle: The person might feel justified because they wanted to warn the new BF. However, the method of disclosure was direct contact without the ex's consent. Maybe a better approach would have been not to interfere, or to talk to their own friends without involving the new BF. \n\nAlso, the fact that the ex lied to friends and stole them could add context, but it doesn't necessarily justify informing the new partner. \n\nSo, considering all that, the person might be in the wrong because they crossed a boundary by contacting the new boyfriend. Even if their intention was good, the act of sharing personal information about an ex without consent can be seen as meddling. The answer is likely A (yes, in the wrong).\n"
