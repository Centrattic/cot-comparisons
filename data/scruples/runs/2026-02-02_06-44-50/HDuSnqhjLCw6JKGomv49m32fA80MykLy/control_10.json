I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong after telling their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the situation: The ex cheated, the author found out through a friend, confronted her, they broke up. Then, five months later, the author finds the new boyfriend's info and emails him about the cheating. The boyfriend breaks up with her, and now the ex and the author's ex-friends are calling the author an asshole. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's reasoning is that they wanted to protect the new boyfriend from being cheated on, similar to how they would want to know. But did they have the right to do that? Let's think about ethics here. Telling someone else about a past relationship's issues, especially when it's personal and potentially harmful to the current partner.\n\nOn one hand, the author might believe they're doing the right thing by preventing the new boyfriend from being deceived. On the other hand, sharing that information could be seen as violating the ex's privacy and possibly interfering in another person's relationship. The author didn't go through the ex to get the information to the new boyfriend, which could be considered a breach of trust, even if the ex was unfaithful.\n\nAlso, the author's ex-friends don't believe them and side with the ex. That might be because the ex lied to them before, but that doesn't change the fact that the author took matters into their own hands. There's a line between sharing information and sabotaging someone else's relationship. Even if the ex cheated, the author's method of sharing that information could be problematic. \n\nAnother angle: the author might have a right to be upset and want to prevent others from being hurt, but it's not their place to act as a judge and inform someone else's partner. The new boyfriend should ideally find out the truth on his own or from his partner. The author's action could be seen as interfering. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action is likely crossing a boundary. They might have valid reasons, but the method is questionable. Therefore, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
