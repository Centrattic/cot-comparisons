I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about her cheating is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The ex cheated, they broke up, and now the person is contacting the ex's new boyfriend to inform him. The main issue here is whether sharing that information is justified or not.\n\nThe person's reasoning is that they would want to know if their new partner cheated on a previous partner. That's a common sentiment, but does it justify telling someone something private? \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, unless there's some sort of harassment or threat involved, the person isn't breaking the law. But legally isn't the only angle. Ethically, it's a gray area. The person might feel justified because they wanted to protect the new boyfriend from being cheated on. However, the ex could argue that the information shared is private and that the person had no right to interfere.\n\nAlso, the consequences: the new boyfriend broke up with her because of the information. The ex is now upset and the person is being called an asshole by people who don't know the full story. \n\nThe key points here are privacy and consent. The person might have a personal grievance, but sharing personal information about someone else without their consent can be seen as a breach of privacy. Even if the intention is good, the method might be problematic. \n\nIn relationships, people often have different boundaries. The person might believe they're doing the right thing by being honest, but they didn't get consent from their ex to share that information. The ex's new partner has the right to know, but the way it was communicated could be seen as meddling in a new relationship. \n\nAnother angle is the ongoing conflict. The ex is stealing friends and spreading the person's story as false, so there's a history of conflict. The person might feel vindictive, but that doesn't necessarily make them in the wrong. \n\nIn summary, while the person's intent was to protect the new boyfriend, the act of contacting him without consent could be considered overstepping. So the answer might be that the person is in the wrong (A), but there's nuance here. However, considering the context of the ex's actions and the person's intent, it's a tough call. But generally, sharing someone's personal information without their permission is usually seen as wrong, hence answer A.\n"
