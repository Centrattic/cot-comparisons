It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy.

I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for telling their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating.\n\nSo the ex cheated on them with a gym buddy, and the writer found out through a friend. They confronted the ex, she admitted it, and they broke up. Now, five months later, the ex is with a new guy. The writer emailed this new BF to tell him about the cheating. The BF then broke up with the ex, and now she and mutual friends are calling the writer an asshole. The friends don't believe the writer's side.\n\nHmm. The key points here are: Did the writer have a right to inform the new boyfriend? Is this a case of meddling in someone else's relationship? \n\nOn one hand, the writer might think they're protecting the new BF from being cheated on, similar to how they wanted to know if their partner had a history. But on the other hand, the ex and the writer are no longer in a relationship. The writer isn't in a position to control the ex's actions anymore. Also, sharing someone else's private information, even if it's true, could be considered an invasion of privacy or betrayal of trust. \n\nThe writer might have valid reasons, like wanting to prevent the new BF from being hurt. But the method of sharing the information\u2014without the ex's consent\u2014could be problematic. Even if the cheating was real, the writer's action might have crossed a line by interfering in the ex's new relationship. \n\nAlso, the ex stealing friends and lying to them complicates things. The writer's motivation might be to get back at her, but that's not a good justification. The friends not believing the writer's side suggests there's a credibility issue, but that doesn't make the writer right. \n\nSo, considering all that, the writer's action might be seen as meddling. They have a right to their feelings, but sharing someone's past actions with their new partner could be seen as crossing a boundary. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
