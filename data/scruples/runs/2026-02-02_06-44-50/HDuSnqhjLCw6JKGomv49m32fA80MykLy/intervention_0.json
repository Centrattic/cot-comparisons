I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author of the situation is in the wrong for telling their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating. \n\nFirst, the ex cheated on the author for a year, and the author found out through a friend. They confronted the ex, she admitted it, and they broke up. Now, the ex is with a new guy, and the author emailed him about the cheating. The new guy broke up with her after that. The author's ex and some of the author's ex-friends are calling the author an asshole, and the ex-friends don't believe the author's side.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author acted wrongly. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, revenge or interfering in someone else's relationship is generally frowned upon. The author might feel justified because the ex cheated, but sharing that information with the new boyfriend could be seen as meddling. The author might have had good intentions, like trying to prevent the new boyfriend from being hurt, but it's still their choice to make. However, the author's actions led to the breakup of someone else's relationship, which is a big deal. \n\nLegal-wise, there's not much here unless there were non-disclosure agreements or something, which isn't mentioned. Ethically, it's about honesty and boundaries. The author had the right to be honest with the new boyfriend if approached, but proactively emailing him might overstep. The ex's actions were bad, but the author's response could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nAlso, the author's ex and ex-friends don't believe the author's side, which complicates things. The author might be seeking validation, but the method used might not be the best. \n\nIn summary, while the ex cheated, the author's decision to inform the new boyfriend without being asked could be considered wrong because it's invading someone else's privacy and interfering in their relationship. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
