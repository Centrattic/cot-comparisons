I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that they told their ex's new boyfriend that she cheated on them. The ex cheated, and the writer found out through a friend. They confronted her, it ended badly, and now the ex has new friends and a new BF.\n\nThe writer sent an email to the new BF about the cheating. The BF broke up with her because of that. Now, the ex and her friends are calling the writer an asshole. The writer's friends don't believe their side.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about whether the writer had the right to inform the new BF. On one hand, the writer might feel they were protecting the new BF from being cheated on again, which is understandable. But on the other hand, the writer isn't the one who should be the one to tell the new BF about their ex's past. That might be considered an invasion of privacy or meddling.\n\nThe writer's actions could be seen as crossing a boundary. Even though the ex cheated, the writer isn't in a position to decide what the new BF should know. The ex's actions are between her and the BF; the writer's role in the relationship is past. By revealing that information, the writer might have overstepped, especially since it led to the breakup. The BF might have made a decision based on the writer's information without knowing the full context from the ex's side.\n\nBut some might argue that the writer was acting in the BF's best interest, similar to someone wanting to warn a friend about a potential problem. However, in most cases, people aren't expected to share past partners' infidelities unless the current partner asks. The writer could have approached it differently, maybe by setting boundaries or not getting involved.\n\nThe fact that the writer's friends believe the ex's side adds another layer. If the ex is lying now, the writer's actions might be justified, but that's not clear. The writer's email might have caused harm without their consent. So, the main question is about the right to share someone else's private information, even if it's true.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a principle about respecting others' privacy. The writer might have violated that by sharing the cheating information. Also, the BF might have had the right to know, but the method and who shares that information matters. The writer isn't the appropriate person to disclose that. Therefore, the writer is likely in the wrong.\n"
