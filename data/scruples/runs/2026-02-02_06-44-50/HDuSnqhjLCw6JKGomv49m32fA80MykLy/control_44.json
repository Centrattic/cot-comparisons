I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the ex cheated on them for a year. The person found out through a friend, confronted the ex, they broke up, and the ex took friends with her. Now, five months later, the ex is with a new guy. The author sent an anonymous email to the new boyfriend revealing the cheating. The new guy broke things off, and now the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author did the right thing. On one hand, the author might feel they were protecting the new boyfriend by not letting him be lied to. On the other hand, the author didn't go through the ex to get this information out. The ex's current friends don't know about the cheating, so they believe her version.\n\nI think there's a moral conflict here. The author might believe they're doing the right thing by being honest, but they bypassed the ex's right to share her past. Telling someone's partner about past infidelity without consent is usually considered a breach of privacy and trust. Even if the author's intention was good, the method was invasive. The ex's new partner might have had the right to know, but the way it was revealed could be problematic. The author might be seen as interfering in someone else's relationship, which is generally frowned upon. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they took a direct action that's considered an invasion of privacy, even if their intentions were to protect the new partner.\n"
