I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who told their ex's new boyfriend that she cheated is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author's ex cheated on them, and after finding out, they ended the relationship. Now the ex is dating someone new, and the author contacted the new boyfriend to inform him about the cheating. The ex and some of the author's ex-friends are upset and think the author is an asshole.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is it wrong to tell someone that your ex cheated on you, especially if you think the new partner should know?\n\nWell, privacy is a big factor here. The author's ex has a right to privacy, but so does the author. The author might feel justified in wanting to protect the new boyfriend from being cheated on again. But, the ex might see it as an invasion of privacy and betrayal.\n\nLegally, there's no law against telling someone about a past relationship's issues, but ethically, it's more complicated. The author didn't have the ex's permission to share that information. Even if the author's intention was good (to warn the new BF), it's still a breach of trust between the ex and the author.\n\nAlso, the author's method of sharing\u2014via email, not through the ex\u2014might be problematic. The ex has the right to disclose her past, not someone else. The author might have overstepped by taking matters into their own hands instead of letting the new BF find out from her directly, if she chose to.\n\nAnother angle: the author's ex lied to friends and stole them. That adds to the complexity. The author felt wronged and wanted to set the record straight, but using this method caused more harm. The ex's friends are now on her side because they don't know the whole story, which is a consequence of the author not sharing the information directly with them.\n\nSo, while the author had a valid reason (ex cheated), the way they handled it might be seen as wrong. They didn't consider the ex's right to privacy or the potential consequences of sharing personal information without consent. The new BF has the right to know, but the author's approach was arguably inappropriate.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
