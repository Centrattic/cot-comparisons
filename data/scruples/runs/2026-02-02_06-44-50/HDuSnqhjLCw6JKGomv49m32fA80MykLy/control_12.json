      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the ex cheated during their 3-year relationship, the person found out, broke up, and then later told the new boyfriend. Now the ex and their mutual friends are upset, calling the user an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The person's ex cheated, they found out through a friend, confronted her, she confessed, they broke up. Then, the person told the new boyfriend about the cheating. The new boyfriend broke up with her because of this, and now the ex and her friends are mad at the user.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user was right to inform the new boyfriend. Let's consider the possible angles. On one hand, the user might feel that the new boyfriend deserves to know the truth, especially if they were in a relationship. On the other hand, the user is sharing private information about their ex with someone else, which could be seen as interfering in someone else's relationship.\n\nLegal aspects? Probably not relevant here unless there's a privacy law involved, but that's more about legality than morality. Morally, it's about intent and consequences. Was it right to share this information? The user's reasoning was that if they were in the new boyfriend's position, they would want to know. That's a common argument, similar to the \"if you love someone, you tell them the truth\" idea. But does that apply here?\n\nHowever, the user is now sharing someone else's private information. Even if the user knows it's true, sharing it without consent can be problematic. The new boyfriend had the right to know if his partner was unfaithful, but the user is the one who informed him. The ex's actions were wrong, but does that justify the user exposing her to the new boyfriend?\n\nThere's also the impact on their own reputation. The user is now being called an asshole by the ex and mutual friends. That suggests that the social circle perceives the user's action as crossing a line. The user's friends might not know the context, but the ex's side of the story is being believed, which complicates things.\n\nAnother angle: the user's motivation. Were they seeking revenge? Or trying to protect the new boyfriend? If it's revenge, then it's more likely to be wrong. If it's to inform someone about a potential partner's past, maybe more justifiable. However, the user might have overstepped by not letting the new boyfriend find out on his own.\n\nAlso, the user's actions led to the breakup of the ex's new relationship. That's a significant consequence. Even if the ex cheated, the user's disclosure directly caused the new boyfriend to end the relationship. That could be seen as meddling, which isn't their place.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often consider it wrong to share someone's private information, even if it's true. There's a balance between honesty and respecting privacy. The user might have thought they were doing the right thing, but the method could be questionable. They could have approached it differently, like maybe talking to the ex first instead of the new boyfriend.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the user did share a truth that the new boyfriend might not have known, but the method and timing could be problematic. The user's intent matters, but the action of disclosing private information without the ex's consent is often seen as crossing a line. Therefore, the answer might be that the user is in the wrong (A), because they revealed someone else's private information, which is not typically acceptable regardless of the context.\n"
