I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The ex cheated, which is clear. The author found out through a friend, confronted her, they broke up. Now, the ex is dating someone new. The author emailed the new boyfriend about the cheating. The new boyfriend broke up with her because of that. The ex and her friends (who were the author's ex-friends) are calling the author an asshole, and they don't know the truth.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author had the right to inform the new boyfriend without the ex's consent. The author's reasoning is that they would want to know if their partner cheated, so they thought it was right to share that information. \n\nI need to evaluate the ethics here. Telling someone's partner about past infidelity without their knowledge or permission is a gray area. On one hand, the cheating was in the past, and the current relationship is between the ex and the new boyfriend. The author might feel they are preventing the new boyfriend from being hurt. But on the other hand, the ex has a right to privacy, and the author's actions could be seen as meddling in someone else's relationship.\n\nAnother angle is the author's own behavior. If they were hurt by the ex's actions, maybe they should have let the ex deal with it on her own. However, the author might not be at fault if their intention was to protect the new boyfriend from potential harm. But the problem is that the author didn't go through the ex first; they went straight to the new partner, which could be seen as crossing a line.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author's friends believe the ex's version of events and not theirs complicates things. The author might feel vindicated in their actions because their side isn't being heard, but that doesn't necessarily justify the method.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a judgment call. Some might say the author had good intentions, while others might say they overstepped. Legally, there's no issue, but ethically, it's more about social norms. People often consider that sharing such personal information without consent can damage relationships and privacy. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author likely is in the wrong because they shared private information without the ex's consent, which is a breach of trust and privacy, even if their intentions were good.\n"
