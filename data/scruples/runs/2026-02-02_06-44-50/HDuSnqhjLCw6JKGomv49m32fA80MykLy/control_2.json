It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy.

I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about telling an ex's new boyfriend that the ex cheated. \n\nFirst, the author's ex cheated on them during the last year of their 3-year relationship. The author found out through a friend and confronted the ex, leading to a breakup. Now, the ex is dating someone new, and the author sent an email to the new BF revealing the infidelity. The BF broke up with the ex because of this, and now the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author might feel justified because they wanted the new BF to know the truth, similar to how they would want to know if their partner had a cheater in the past. But on the other hand, sharing such information without the ex's consent could be seen as interfering or causing unnecessary harm. \n\nEthically, there's a debate here. Some might argue that the author has a duty to protect others from being hurt, especially if the ex lied. Others might say that the author crossed a boundary by contacting the new BF directly, especially since the issue was between them and their ex. The author could have approached it differently, maybe through the ex or legal means if there were other issues, but directly contacting the new partner might be seen as overstepping.\n\nAlso, the consequences: the ex's new BF ended the relationship, which the author might have caused. The ex is upset, and the author's friends now side with the ex. The author's actions might have led to a public fallout and damaged relationships. \n\nIn many cases, people are advised not to interfere in a new relationship like this. It's possible the author's intention was good, but the method was problematic. The key here is whether the author had the right to disclose that information. Since the author and ex are no longer together, the author isn't in a position to control the ex's new relationships. \n\nI think the answer here leans towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they took action without considering the consequences or the boundaries. However, some might argue the other way if they believe the new BF had a right to know. But typically, such disclosures are considered a breach of privacy unless there's a legal justification. So probably answer A.\n"
