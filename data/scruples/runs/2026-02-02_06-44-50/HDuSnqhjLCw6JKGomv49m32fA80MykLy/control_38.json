I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who told the ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the ex cheated on them with a gym buddy. They found out through a friend, confronted her, she admitted it, and they broke up. Then, five months later, the ex starts dating a new guy. The person here emails the new boyfriend to tell him about the cheating, leading to the new boyfriend breaking up with her. Now, the ex and others are calling the person an asshole, and the ex's friends don't believe the person's side.\n\nSo, the key issue here is whether revealing someone else's secret, even if it's about cheating, is justified. On one hand, the person might feel they were protecting the new boyfriend from being cheated on again. But on the other hand, sharing that information without consent could invade the ex's privacy and disrupt the new relationship.\n\nIn relationships, infidelity is a serious issue, but does the ex's new partner have a right to know? Maybe, but the person here didn't go through the ex to inform the new boyfriend. Instead, they took it upon themselves to email him directly. That could be seen as meddling. Also, the person's ex is probably the one who should decide whether to share her past with her current partner.\n\nAnother angle: the person might have been hurt and wanted to prevent the new boyfriend from getting hurt. But taking matters into their own hands by contacting the new partner without the ex's consent might be crossing a boundary. It's possible that if the new boyfriend wanted to know the history, he should have asked the ex directly. The person's action could be seen as violating the ex's privacy and possibly causing unnecessary harm.\n\nAlso, the aftermath is that the ex and her friends are upset, and the person's actions led to a breakup. While the new boyfriend might have been right to break up if the ex had cheated, the person's method of revealing the information is questionable. They might have a valid reason, but the approach was inappropriate.\n\nSo, considering all that, the person might be in the wrong for not respecting the ex's privacy and for interfering in her new relationship. The answer is likely A.\n"
