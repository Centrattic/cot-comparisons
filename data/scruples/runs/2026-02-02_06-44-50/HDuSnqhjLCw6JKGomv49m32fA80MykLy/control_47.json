It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy.

I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating. \n\nFirst, the context: The author's ex cheated on them with a gym buddy, discovered through a friend, confronted her, they broke up badly. The ex lied to friends and stole them. Now, the author found out the ex is dating someone new, so they emailed the new BF about the cheating. The new BF broke up with her because of that, and now the author is being called an asshole by the ex's friends who believe her side.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author is sharing personal information about their ex's past. The ex was unfaithful, which is a serious issue. The author's intention was to inform the new BF so he could make an informed decision. But by doing so, the author is directly involved in causing the new relationship to end. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the ex did something wrong, and the author felt betrayed. Maybe they wanted to protect the new BF from the same pain. But on the other hand, the author didn't have the ex's permission to share that information. Even if the intention was good, it's a privacy issue. The ex might have moved on, and the author is interfering in her new relationship. \n\nAlso, the ex's friends are siding with her, so the author might be seen as spreading rumors. But the author has proof since the friend overheard them. However, the way the author chose to share it\u2014without going through the ex first\u2014could be problematic. \n\nIn relationships, cheating is a major deal. But how you handle it after the breakup matters. The author might have a right to be upset, but contacting the new partner directly with such personal info could be considered overstepping. It's about boundaries post-breakup. Even if the ex was wrong, the author's actions could be seen as revenge or interfering. \n\nAlso, the consequences: The new BF broke up because of the author's email, which might be justified if it's true, but the author's method could have been unwise. Maybe they should have focused on their own healing instead of inserting into the ex's new life. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong. Because even though the ex cheated, the author didn't have the right to disclose that information to her new partner. It's a breach of privacy and could be seen as sabotaging the new relationship. The right thing might have been to let the new BF find out on his own or not be involved in spreading the info.\n"
