I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their ex's new boyfriend about the ex cheating. The ex cheated, the author found out, ended the relationship, and then later contacted the new BF with the information. The BF ended the relationship because of that, and now the ex and mutual friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and ethical aspects here. The author's intention was to warn the new BF about their ex's past infidelity. On one hand, they might feel justified because they would want to know if their partner had cheated before. On the other hand, sharing someone's private information, even if it's true, can be seen as a violation of privacy. \n\nThe author's action led to the breakup of the new BF and the ex. While the cheating was real, the author didn't have the ex's consent to share that information. Even if the author's intent was to protect the new BF, the method might be questionable. It's possible that the new BF didn't need the author's input and could have made his own decision based on his own interactions with the ex. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author's ex is now getting support from mutual friends who don't know the full story suggests that the author's actions might have damaged relationships further. The author might have acted out of personal vindication or to feel heard, which can be a motive that's not entirely altruistic. \n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, while the ex's cheating was real, the act of informing the new BF without consent could be considered meddling. People generally have the right to privacy, and sharing someone's past without their permission can be harmful. The author's action might have crossed a line, even if their intention was good. \n\nSo, based on the information, the author is in the wrong because revealing someone's personal information, even if true, without their consent can be seen as invasive and disrespectful. The consequences of their action affected not just their ex but also the new BF's decision, which might not have been necessary for the BF to know from the author. Therefore, the answer would likely be A.\n"
