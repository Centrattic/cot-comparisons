I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the ex cheated during the 3-year relationship. The person found out through a friend and confronted her, leading to a breakup. Now, five months later, the ex is with a new boyfriend, and the person emailed him about the cheating incident. The new boyfriend broke up with her because of that. The ex and her friends are calling the person an asshole, and the ex's friends believe her side.\n\nHmm. So, the main question is whether the person did the right thing by informing the new BF. On one hand, they might have thought they were doing the right thing by preventing the new BF from being cheated on. On the other hand, they might have overstepped by sharing personal information without the ex's consent, especially after the breakup.\n\nI need to consider if there's a legal or ethical boundary here. After a breakup, how much responsibility do you have towards your ex's new relationships? The person's reasoning was that they would want to know if their new partner cheated before. But does that justify sharing such information without the ex's permission? \n\nAlso, the ex lied to friends and stole them, which complicates things. The person might feel justified, but spreading that info could be seen as revenge or interfering. The new BF has a right to know, but the method of telling might matter. Emailing him directly without the ex's consent could be problematic.\n\nIn some cases, people might think that the person has a right to defend their side, especially if their ex is now misleading others. But intentionally causing the breakup might be seen as vindictive. It's a gray area. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal ethics. However, generally, sharing private information about an ex without their consent, even if true, could be considered wrong. So the person might be in the wrong here.\n"
