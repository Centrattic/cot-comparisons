I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling the ex's new boyfriend about the cheating. So, the situation is that the author's ex cheated on him with a gym buddy. After breaking up, the author emails the new boyfriend to inform him about the cheating. The ex is now being called an asshole by her friends, but they believe her version.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author had a reason to want the new BF to know, thinking it's important for transparency. But did he have the right to do that? Maybe the author felt it was justified because he would want to know if his partner had cheated before. However, the ex is now in a new relationship, and the author's action might have violated her privacy. \n\nOn one hand, the ex did cheat, which is a valid reason to end the relationship. The author might have felt that the new BF had a right to know. But on the other hand, sharing that information could be seen as retaliation or interfering in someone else's relationship. It's possible that the author crossed a boundary by directly contacting the new BF, especially after the breakup. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author's ex and her friends are now turning against him, while the ex-friends believe her, shows that the situation might have been complicated. The author might have acted out of anger or a desire for revenge, which could make his actions inappropriate. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, people are advised to avoid spreading information about others without their consent, even if the information is true. The author didn't consult with the ex before sharing the information, which could be a problem. Even if the intent was good, the method might be questionable. \n\nSo, considering all angles, it seems like the author did act in a way that's considered wrong because he interfered in a new relationship without the ex's permission. While the cheating was a valid issue, sharing it directly with the new BF might not be the right approach. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
