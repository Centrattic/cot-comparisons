I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The ex cheated on them, and the user found out through a friend. They confronted the ex, things ended messily, and the ex took their friends. Now, five months later, the ex is with a new guy. The user told the new boyfriend about the cheating, leading to the breakup. The ex and friends are calling the user an asshole, but the ex's friends don't believe the user's side.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries and privacy. When a relationship ends, especially one that's ended badly, there's often lingering resentment. The user's action was to inform the new partner about the cheating. The question is whether that's justified.\n\nOn one hand, the user feels it's important for the new boyfriend to know the truth, as they would want the same information if roles were reversed. This is about honesty and protecting someone from potential heartbreak. \n\nOn the other hand, sharing such personal information without the ex's consent could be seen as violating privacy. Even if the user's intention was good, the method might be questionable. The new boyfriend had the right to know, but the user went around the ex to inform him directly, which might not be the best approach. \n\nAlso, considering the aftermath: the ex's friends don't believe the user's side, which complicates things. The user might have expected a different reaction, but the fallout is that they're being labeled as an asshole. \n\nLegally, there's no wrongdoing here since it's about personal matters, but ethically, it's a gray area. The user's action could be seen as revenge or an attempt to undermine the ex, especially given the history of the breakup. However, the user's reasoning is that it's about transparency in a new relationship. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is important, but the way to convey that honesty matters. The user might have thought they were doing the right thing by informing the new boyfriend, but doing so without the ex's consent and after the fact could be seen as overstepping. \n\nIt's also worth considering if there was any malicious intent. If the user's goal was to hurt the ex or get back at her, that's different than genuinely wanting the new partner to know. The user claims they would want to know, so their intent seems to be about honesty rather than revenge. \n\nIn conclusion, while the user's intention might be good, the act of sharing someone else's personal information without their consent, even if it's true, is generally considered wrong. It's a breach of privacy and can lead to more harm than good, even if the information is damaging. So, the user is in the wrong here.\n"
