I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The ex cheated, they broke up, and the author found out through a friend. Then, after five months, the ex starts dating someone new. The author contacts the new boyfriend via email explaining the cheating. The new boyfriend breaks up with the ex based on this info. Now the ex and their friends are upset, and the author's former friends (who are now on the ex's side) are calling the author an asshole because they don't know the truth.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. I need to determine if A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No) is correct.\n\nKey points to consider:\n- The author has a valid reason (the ex cheated), but did they have the right to inform the new boyfriend?\n- Was the author's action justified, or was it a breach of privacy?\n- The ex's new relationship is the author's ex's current relationship, so the author might feel it's their duty to speak out.\n- However, by sharing this information, the author is interfering in the new relationship without the ex's consent.\n- The ex's cheating is part of their history, but the author's action could be seen as spreading gossip or not respecting boundaries.\n\nEthically, even if the ex cheated, sharing that information with the new partner without their consent can be problematic. The new boyfriend isn't part of the original relationship, so the author's disclosure might be considered meddling. The author might have a right to feel hurt, but revealing past infidelity to a new partner isn't typically considered appropriate unless it's a direct question from the new partner.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation is to protect the new boyfriend from being cheated on again, but the method is questionable. The author's action led to the breakup, which could be seen as justified if the information was true. However, the means of disclosure (emailing without consent) is where the issue lies.\n\nIn many cases, people are advised not to interfere in past relationships, even ex-partners. The author's action might be seen as crossing a boundary. While the ex cheated, the author's action could be viewed as taking matters into their own hands instead of letting the current partner decide what to do.\n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they shared personal information about their ex without her consent, which invaded her privacy and interfered in her new relationship. The right to know is one thing, but the right to share is another. So the answer is A.\n"
