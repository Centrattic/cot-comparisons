I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their ex's new boyfriend that their ex cheated on them. The ex cheated, they found out, broke up, and then later the author told the new boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's intention was to prevent the new boyfriend from being cheated on, right? They thought, \"If I were in his position, I'd want to know.\" But did they overstep? Telling someone else's partner about past infidelity is a big step. Even if the ex was wrong, sharing that information without consent might be crossing a line.\n\nThen there's the impact. The new boyfriend broke up with the ex because of the author's message. The ex and her friends are now calling the author an asshole. The author's friends don't believe them because they've taken the ex's side. So the author's actions caused a breakup but also led to social fallout for themselves.\n\nLegally, there might not be a violation, but morally, it's a gray area. The author had a valid reason but used a method that could be seen as invasive. The ex's privacy and the new boyfriend's right to hear the information from the ex herself are factors. The author didn't confront the ex first to make her own the person who informed the new BF, which might be a point against them.\n\nAlso, the author's ex-friends not believing them suggests there's a conflict in the narrative. The author's approach might have been a bit vindictive, wanting to get back at the ex for stealing friends. That adds a layer where the author's actions might be more about revenge than protecting the new BF.\n\nSo, putting it all together: while the author had a genuine reason, the method and timing might be at fault. They didn't give the ex a chance to address it, and sharing personal information without consent is generally frowned upon. So the answer is likely A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
