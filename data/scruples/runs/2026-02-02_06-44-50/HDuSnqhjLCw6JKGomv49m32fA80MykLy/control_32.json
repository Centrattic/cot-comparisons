I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves telling an ex's new boyfriend about the ex cheating.\n\nFirst, the ex cheated, which is a major betrayal. The author found out through a friend and confronted the ex, leading to a breakup. Now, five months later, the ex is dating someone new. The author contacts this new boyfriend, tells him about the cheating, and the boyfriend breaks up with the ex as a result. The ex and her friends are upset, but the author's reasoning is that he would want to know if his new partner had cheated before.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. On one hand, the author has a valid reason\u2014disclosing past infidelity could be important for someone entering a new relationship. The author might believe he was preventing the new boyfriend from being cheated on. On the other hand, the author took the initiative without the new boyfriend's consent, which could be seen as an invasion of privacy or meddling. Even though the ex was the one who cheated, the author's action of revealing that information might have caused further harm, especially if the ex was trying to move on.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's motives. Was he doing this out of self-interest, like getting revenge, or genuinely to protect the new boyfriend? The story mentions that the author's friends (who were taken by the ex) might still be biased, but the author's main point is about transparency. However, the method of disclosure\u2014without the ex's consent\u2014could be problematic. The new boyfriend has the right to know, but the author might not be the best person to disclose that information. It's usually the person's responsibility to share their own past, not someone else's.\n\nAnother angle: The author could be seen as taking justice into his own hands. The ex's actions were wrong, but the author's response might have crossed a line. While the intention was to prevent another person from being hurt, the approach might not be appropriate. The author could have handled it differently, maybe by encouraging the ex to be honest with her new partner instead of doing it himself.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were driven by a desire to protect the new boyfriend, but the method was questionable. Telling someone about a past partner's infidelity without their consent is generally not advisable. So, the author is likely in the wrong (Answer A).\n"
