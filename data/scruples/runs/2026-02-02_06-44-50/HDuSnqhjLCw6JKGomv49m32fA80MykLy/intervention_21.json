I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves telling an ex's new boyfriend that the ex cheated. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author's ex was unfaithful during their 3-year relationship. The author found out through a friend, confronted the ex, they broke up, and then the ex stole friends. Now, the ex is in a new relationship, and the author sent the new BF an email about the cheating. The new BF broke up with the ex because of this. Now, the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate that. \n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author had the right to inform the new BF. On one hand, the author might feel justified because they believe the new BF should know about the ex's past behavior. On the other hand, sharing such information could be seen as interfering in another relationship, especially after the breakup.\n\nEthically, there's a debate here. Some might say that the author is protecting the new BF from potential harm by revealing the ex's infidelity. Others might argue that the author is overstepping by sharing private information, regardless of the intent. \n\nLegally, unless there's a breach of confidentiality or some law violated, it's probably not a legal issue. But morally, it's a gray area. The author's actions might be seen as vengeful or harmful, especially since the ex's friends don't believe the author's side. The author's motivation could be to get back at the ex for stealing friends, which might color the judgment negatively.\n\nAlso, the method of sharing the information\u2014sending an email directly\u2014could be problematic. The author didn't go through the ex to inform the new BF, which might have been a more respectful approach, even if the ex was at fault. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the author is likely in the wrong because they took a personal action that interfered with the new relationship, possibly out of spite rather than a genuine concern for the new BF's well-being. The key points are the lack of authorization, the method used, and the potential for malicious intent.\n"
