I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author told their ex's new boyfriend about the ex cheating. The ex cheated, they found out, broke up, and then the author contacted the new boyfriend to inform him. Now the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's intention was to protect the new boyfriend from being cheated on, similar to what happened. But did they overstep by contacting him directly? Usually, people might think that sharing such information without the ex's consent could be considered invading privacy or interfering. Even though the ex was dishonest, the author's action might be seen as retaliatory or spreading gossip.\n\nAlso, the outcome was that the new boyfriend broke up with the ex because he found out through the author. The author's ex-friends are siding with the ex, maybe because they don't know the whole story. But the author's action led to the breakup, which could be seen as harsh. The key question here is whether the author had the right to disclose that information. \n\nIn many cases, people are advised not to spread personal information about ex-partners, even if the ex did something wrong. It's about respecting boundaries. Even if the author had good intentions, the method of informing the new boyfriend without the ex's knowledge might be considered inappropriate. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they crossed a boundary by contacting the new boyfriend directly. Even though the ex cheated, the author's action isn't justified by the same behavior. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
