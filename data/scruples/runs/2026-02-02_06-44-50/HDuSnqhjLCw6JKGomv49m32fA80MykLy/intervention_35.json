I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their ex's new boyfriend that she cheated. The situation is that the ex cheated on them, they found out, broke up, and then the author told the new boyfriend about the cheating. The ex and her friends are now calling the author an a**hole.\n\nHmm. So, first, the author's actions. They found out about the cheating through a friend, confronted the ex, ended the relationship. Then, after five months, the ex is dating someone new. The author emails the new boyfriend to inform him about the cheating. The new boyfriend breaks up with her because of this. The ex's friends side with her and the author is being called an a**hole.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, there's a few angles here. On one hand, the author is sharing information that could be important for the new partner to know, maybe to protect him from being cheated on again. The author's reasoning is that if their new partner had the same situation, they'd want to know. But on the other hand, the ex is no longer in a relationship with the author, so maybe the author shouldn't be interfering. Also, the ex might be seen as having moved on, and the author's actions could be considered meddling or revenge.\n\nI think there's a debate here. Some might say the author had a right to protect the new partner from being lied to again. Others might argue that the author is overstepping by contacting the new partner after the breakup. The fact that the ex lied and stole friends adds context to the author's motivation. However, even if the author's intent was good, contacting someone else's partner about past relationships could be seen as intrusive. \n\nIn some cases, people might say that the author's actions were justified because they're preventing another person from being hurt. But typically, after a breakup, the former partner isn't supposed to be involved in the new partner's relationships. So maybe the author crossed a line here. The fact that the ex's friends still side with her and not the author suggests that the community might not agree with the author's decision. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because even though the information is true, sharing it with an ex's new partner isn't something that's generally considered acceptable. It's a breach of privacy and could be seen as interfering. So answer A.\n"
