I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves an ex who cheated, and the author told the new boyfriend about the cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The ex cheated with a gym buddy, the author found out through a friend, confronted her, and they broke up. Then, after five months, the ex starts dating someone new. The author emails the new BF about the cheating, leading to the BF breaking things off with the ex. Now, the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole, and the author's ex-friends don't believe their side.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether it was wrong for the author to inform the new BF. There are several angles to consider. Legally, there's no law against sharing information like this, but ethically, it's tricky. The author is trying to prevent someone else from being hurt by the same cheating. On the other hand, the ex is now with a new partner, and the author might have overstepped by contacting the new BF without being asked.\n\nEmotionally, the author might feel justified because they wanted the new BF to know the truth. However, inserting oneself into someone else's new relationship can be seen as meddling. Even if the ex cheated, the author isn't the BF's authority to make decisions for him. The BF should have the right to know, but the method of disclosure matters. The author didn't go through the ex to inform her first, which could have been a more respectful approach.\n\nAlso, the consequences: the BF broke up with the ex, and now the author is being blamed. The ex's friends don't believe the author, which adds to the conflict. The author's actions might have been out of spite or a desire for revenge, which complicates their position.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a debate between honesty and respecting boundaries. While the author had valid reasons, they crossed into the new BF's domain without invitation. The right to privacy of the ex might also be a factor, though she did cheat. However, sharing information with someone else's partner isn't typically advised unless it's in a context like a background check for a job, which isn't the case here.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions, while possibly well-intentioned, were likely overreaching. They had the right to be upset, but contacting the new BF directly was a breach of privacy and could be seen as interfering. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
