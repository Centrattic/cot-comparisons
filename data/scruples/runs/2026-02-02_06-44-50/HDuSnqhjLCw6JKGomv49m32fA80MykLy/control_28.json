It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy.

I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The ex cheated during the last year of a 3-year relationship. The author found out through a friend, confronted the ex, who confessed, and they broke up. Now, five months later, the ex has a new boyfriend. The author emailed this new BF, told him about the cheating, and the BF ended the relationship. Now the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did something wrong. Let's consider different angles. \n\nOn one hand, the author felt the new BF had a right to know about the ex's past behavior. They might think they were protecting the BF from being lied to again. But on the other hand, sharing someone's private information without their consent, even if it's true, can be seen as a violation of privacy. The author confronted the ex and ended the relationship at the time, but now they're taking action after the fact. \n\nAlso, the ex's new BF might not have known about the cheating history, so the author's disclosure led to the breakup. Even though the author's intention was to be honest, did they overstep by spreading this information after the fact? The line between honesty and tattling can be blurry. \n\nAnother point is that the ex stole friends, and the author's current network might be biased. The ex's friends might not believe the author because they were told the ex's side. The author's actions could be seen as revenge or an attempt to undermine the ex's new relationship. \n\nLegally, in many places, even if the cheating is true, revealing it without consent could be problematic, especially if it's shared maliciously. But the ethical side is more nuanced. The author might believe they were acting in the BF's best interest. However, the BF's right to privacy versus the author's right to speak could be in conflict here. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often frown upon spreading someone's secrets, even if the person did something wrong. The author might be justified in their anger and desire to prevent the BF from being hurt again, but the method of sharing that information directly with the BF could be seen as inappropriate. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions are likely to be seen as crossing a boundary. They had the information from their past relationship, but after the breakup, they don't have the right to disclose that information to the ex's new partner. It's about respecting privacy and not interfering in someone else's relationship, even with the intention of helping. Therefore, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
