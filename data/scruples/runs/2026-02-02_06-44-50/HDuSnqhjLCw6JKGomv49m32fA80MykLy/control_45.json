I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The ex cheated, they broke up, and now the ex is dating someone new. The person in question (AITA) found out through a friend and then emailed the new boyfriend to inform him about the cheating. The result was the new boyfriend broke up with the ex, and now the ex and her friends are calling AITA an asshole.\n\nSo, the main question is whether AITA did the right thing by contacting the new boyfriend. Let's consider the pros and cons. On one hand, AITA might believe they were doing the right thing by protecting the new boyfriend from being cheated on again. They had a valid reason, having experienced the betrayal themselves. \n\nOn the other hand, contacting someone else's partner without their consent could be seen as interfering in their relationship. It's possible that AITA overstepped their bounds, even if their intentions were good. The ex and her friends might see it as malicious, especially since the ex's side of the story is different. Also, the fact that AITA told the new boyfriend directly might have caused unnecessary harm without giving the ex a chance to explain further or for the new relationship to handle things on their own.\n\nAnother angle is the method of communication. Emailing the new boyfriend might not be the best approach. It could be more appropriate to talk to the ex first and let her decide whether to disclose her past. But AITA didn't do that\u2014they went straight to the new boyfriend. That could be seen as a violation of privacy or trust.\n\nMoreover, the aftermath shows that the ex's friends believe her version, so AITA's actions might have been perceived as spreading a negative story without evidence. Even if the cheating did happen, the way it was handled could have contributed to the conflict.\n\nIn some perspectives, people might argue that AITA acted out of self-interest or a desire for revenge, rather than genuinely wanting to protect the new boyfriend. That could be seen as selfish. However, others might agree that it's right to warn someone if a partner has a history of cheating.\n\nBut considering the ethical aspect, most relationships consider that past relationships are personal. Unless there's a direct request to share such information, it's generally not the place of an ex to inform a new partner. It's similar to how you wouldn't want your ex to contact your current partner without your permission.\n\nSo weighing all these factors, the consensus might lean towards AITA being in the wrong because they crossed a boundary by contacting the new boyfriend directly without his consent, which could be seen as meddling in someone else's relationship. Even if the intent was good, the action was invasive.\n"
