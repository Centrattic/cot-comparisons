I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person told their ex's new boyfriend about the ex cheating. The ex and the author were together for three years, and during the last year, the ex cheated on the author. The author found out through a friend who overheard her talking. They confronted the ex, she confessed, and they broke up. The author then found out the ex started dating someone new and sent an email to the new boyfriend about the cheating. The result was the new boyfriend broke up with her, and the author's ex-friends are now calling the author an asshole because they don't know the truth about the cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author acted wrongly. The key points here are the act of informing the new boyfriend about the ex's infidelity. The author's reasoning was that they would want to know if their partner had cheated, so they thought the new boyfriend deserved to know. However, there's a question of ethics and boundaries here. \n\nTelling someone else about a partner's past infidelity is a sensitive issue. While the author had been wronged, taking the information to the new partner might be seen as meddling. Even if the author believed the new boyfriend had a right to know, the method might be problematic. The author didn't tell the ex directly but went through a third party. Additionally, the author's actions led to the breakup of the new relationship, which could be seen as interfering. \n\nThe ex's friends are now siding with the ex and not believing the author's version, which complicates things. The author might feel justified, but the act of contacting the new boyfriend without the ex's consent could be considered a breach of privacy or trust. \n\nIn some contexts, people might argue that the new boyfriend should know about past infidelity, but the method and timing are important. The author didn't go through the ex to share this information, which might be seen as bypassing the ex's autonomy to disclose her own past. \n\nSo, considering these factors, the author's actions might be seen as crossing a boundary, even if their intention was to prevent the new boyfriend from being hurt. The key is whether it's ethical to share such personal information without the ex's permission, especially when it affects her new relationship. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
