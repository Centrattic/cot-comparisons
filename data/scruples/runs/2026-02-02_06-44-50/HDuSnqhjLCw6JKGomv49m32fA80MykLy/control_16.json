I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating incident. The ex cheated with a gym buddy, the author found out, they broke up, and then later the author emailed the new boyfriend to inform him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's intention was to protect the new boyfriend by sharing the truth. They might have felt that the new BF deserved to know about the cheating. However, informing someone else's partner about past cheating without being directly asked could be seen as overstepping. The author didn't have a legal right to do that, and it's generally not their place to interfere in someone else's relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex had lied and stolen friends, which caused a messy breakup. The author might feel justified in wanting to prevent the new BF from being hurt similarly. But the method used is problematic. The author didn't take it to the ex directly first or seek mediation. Instead, they went straight to the new BF, which can be seen as sabotaging the ex's new relationship.\n\nAlso, the ex's new BF broke up with her after the email, so the author's action directly caused the breakup. Even if the author's intention was good, the action is invasive. People usually handle their own relationships, and sharing such personal information without consent is a breach of privacy.\n\nThe ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole because they believe the author had no right to interfere. The author's ex-friends don't know the truth and side with the ex, which shows the author's actions might have backfired.\n\nSo, legally and socially, the author's action is questionable. While the intention was to prevent harm, the method was inappropriate. The author should have focused on their own closure and not meddle in the ex's new relationship. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
