I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person's ex cheated, they found out, broke up messily. Five months later, the ex starts dating someone new. The user contacts the new boyfriend, tells him about the cheating. The new boyfriend breaks up with her because of that info. Now, the ex and her friends are calling the user an asshole.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the user was wrong to inform the new boyfriend. Let's consider the arguments. On one hand, the user might feel they're doing the right thing by preventing the new boyfriend from being hurt, similar to how they were. They might believe that honesty is important, even if it's not their place. \n\nOn the other hand, sharing someone's private information, especially about cheating, could be seen as invading their privacy. The user isn't the new boyfriend's partner, so they might not have the right to disclose such personal details. It could also be considered a form of revenge or meddling in the new relationship, which isn't healthy.\n\nLegal and ethical perspectives vary. Legally, unless there's a threat of harm or something illegal, it's probably not actionable. Ethically, it's more about social norms. Telling someone about a past partner's infidelity isn't typically something the ex should do. The user might have a valid reason to want the new BF to know, but the method and intent matter. If the user's intent was to sabotage the relationship, that's different than wanting to protect the new BF.\n\nAlso, the aftermath shows that the ex's side isn't believed by the friends, which complicates things. The user might have acted out of a desire for fairness or revenge. But in relationships, privacy is important, and sharing such information without consent can be seen as crossing a line.\n\nSo, considering all this, the user likely is in the wrong because they shared personal, potentially damaging information about their ex without her consent, which can be viewed as unethical and possibly damaging to the new relationship. The right action might have been to move on and not interfere once the breakup was final.\n"
