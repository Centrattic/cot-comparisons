I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating. \n\nFirst, the situation: The ex cheated on them, the author found out, they broke up. Then, after some time, the ex started dating someone new. The author sent the new boyfriend an email revealing the infidelity.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they would want to know if their partner cheated, so they thought it was right to inform the new BF. But the outcome is that the BF broke things off and the ex is now calling the author an asshole. The ex's friends are defending her and don't believe the author's side.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but wants my opinion.\n\nLet me consider the key points. The main issue here is the act of informing the new boyfriend without the ex's consent. While the ex did cheat, the author is taking it upon themselves to intervene in the new relationship. \n\nIn most ethical frameworks, people have a right to privacy. Even though the author was wronged, revealing personal information about someone else, especially to a third party, can be seen as violating that person's privacy. The author's actions could be considered a breach of confidentiality, even if the intent was to prevent the new boyfriend from being misled.\n\nAdditionally, relationships are between two people. The ex and the new boyfriend are the ones involved, and the author isn't part of that dynamic anymore. By stepping in and sharing that information, the author is essentially interfering in the new partner's right to hear the information directly from their partner. \n\nEven if the author's intention was good, the method might be problematic. The ex might have had reasons to not disclose the cheating, or the new boyfriend might have made a choice based on knowing the truth. However, the act of revealing personal history without consent is generally considered unethical. \n\nAlso, the consequences are that the new relationship ended because of this revelation, leading to social repercussions for the author. The ex's friends are siding with her because they don't know the full story, which the author could have addressed by speaking to them directly, but they didn't. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, were likely an overstep. They didn't have the right to disclose the cheating to the new boyfriend without the ex's permission. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
