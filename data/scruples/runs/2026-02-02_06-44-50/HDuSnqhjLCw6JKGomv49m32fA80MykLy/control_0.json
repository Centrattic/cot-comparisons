      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about telling an ex's new boyfriend that the ex cheated. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author's ex cheated on them with a gym buddy. The author found out through a friend, confronted her, they broke up, and the ex then took the author's friends. Now, the ex is dating someone new, and the author told the new boyfriend about the cheating. The result was the new boyfriend broke things off, and now the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's actions: contacting the new boyfriend without consent to reveal infidelity. The question is whether this action is justified or not.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel they were doing the right thing by informing the new BF to protect him from being cheated on again. They might believe that if they were in the new BF's position, they would want to know. However, sharing such personal information without the ex's consent could be seen as a violation of privacy. The author was not the one to decide to share this information, even if their intentions were good.\n\nAlso, the aftermath: the new BF broke things off, and the ex is using the author's friends (who believe her version) to call the author an asshole. The author didn't tell the friends about the cheating, so their friends are siding with the ex. \n\nLegally, there's no clear wrongdoing, but ethically, it's murky. The author might argue they were protecting the new BF, but the ex could argue that the author is interfering unnecessarily and spreading her secrets. In relationships, honesty is important, but the ex's actions were already in the past. The new BF might have his own reasons for staying with her, but the author's action directly caused the breakup between the new BF and the ex.\n\nAnother angle: the author's motivation. Were they seeking revenge or trying to protect the new BF? If revenge, then it's more likely they're in the wrong. If genuinely trying to inform, maybe less, but still, it's their ex's information to share. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the ex lied to friends and took them away. This adds context to the author's frustration, but doesn't justify the action of informing the new BF. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often have different views. Some might say it's a good deed to protect someone else, others say it's a breach of privacy. But typically, sharing such information without consent is seen as crossing a line. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because they shared private information without the ex's consent, even if their intentions were good. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
