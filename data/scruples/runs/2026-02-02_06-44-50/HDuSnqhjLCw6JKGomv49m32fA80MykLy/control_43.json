I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong. So first, I need to consider the situation step by step.\n\nThe ex cheated, the author found out through a friend, confronted her, broke up, and then later told the ex's new boyfriend about the cheating. The main issue here is whether it's right to inform a new partner about past infidelity.\n\nOn one hand, the author might believe they're doing the new boyfriend a favor by letting him know the ex cheated, so he can make an informed decision. They might feel justified because they would want to know if their partner had a history of cheating. However, this action could be seen as invasive or a breach of privacy. The ex's past actions don't necessarily reflect on her current relationship, and the author is sharing private information without consent.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the breakup wasn't pretty, and the ex lied and stole friends. This context suggests some lingering resentment, which might have influenced the decision to tell the new boyfriend. But even with that context, sharing such information could be considered meddling in the ex's new relationship.\n\nLegally, there's no issue, but ethically, it's a gray area. The new boyfriend has the right to know, but the author might have overstepped by not going through the proper channels. Maybe the author should have encouraged the ex to disclose her past on her own instead of intervening.\n\nAdditionally, the consequences are that the new boyfriend broke up with her, which the author might have intended, but it's causing the ex and mutual friends to turn against the author. The friends believe the ex's side, so the author's actions have led to social fallout.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a tricky call. While the author's intention was to prevent future hurt, the method was direct and possibly unkind. It's often better to let individuals learn about their partner's past through open communication rather than third-party interference. So, the author's action might be seen as wrong because they took it upon themselves to act as a messenger, which isn't typically considered appropriate unless there's a direct threat or harm involved.\n\nTherefore, considering the ethical implications and the method used, the author is likely in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
