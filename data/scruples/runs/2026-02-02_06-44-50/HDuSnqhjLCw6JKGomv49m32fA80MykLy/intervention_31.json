I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation is that they told their ex's new boyfriend about the ex cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's ex cheated, they found out, broke up, and then later told the ex's new boyfriend about the cheating. The new boyfriend ended the relationship because of this, and now the ex and mutual friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. So, I need to consider both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel justified because their ex cheated and lied. They wanted the new boyfriend to know the truth to avoid the same mistake. But on the other hand, the author directly contacted the new boyfriend without the ex's consent. That's invading privacy, maybe even retaliation. \n\nIs it okay to tell someone else about an ex's infidelity? Well, usually, after a breakup, you're supposed to move on and not interfere. The author is interfering in their ex's new relationship, which could be seen as crossing a boundary. Even if the ex did wrong, sharing that information with the new partner might be considered inappropriate. \n\nAlso, the author's ex is now getting negative attention, and the mutual friends turning against the author might complicate things. The friends believed the ex's side, which is common in such situations, but that doesn't make the author right. \n\nThe main issue here is whether the author had the right to contact the new boyfriend. Even though the information is true, spreading it without the ex's consent could be seen as a breach of privacy. People usually expect that after a breakup, they won't be targeted by the ex's actions in their new relationships. \n\nSo, even if the ex cheated, the author's method of addressing it was aggressive and possibly unethical. The right approach might have been to move on and not interfere. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
