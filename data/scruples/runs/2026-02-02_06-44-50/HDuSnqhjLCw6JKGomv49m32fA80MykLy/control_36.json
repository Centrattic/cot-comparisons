It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy.

I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person's ex cheated on them with a gym buddy, and they found out through a friend. They confronted the ex, she admitted it, and they broke up. Then five months later, the ex starts dating a new guy. The author found the new guy's info and sent him an email telling about the cheating. The new guy broke up with her because of that, and now the ex and the author's ex-friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nHmm, the main question is whether the author did the right thing by informing the new BF. On one hand, the author probably felt that the new guy should know about the cheating to make an informed decision. It's a common sentiment that if you were in the new guy's shoes, you'd want to know. But on the other hand, the author is stepping outside of their boundaries here. The ex is now in a new relationship, and the author isn't part of that relationship anymore. By contacting the new BF directly, the author is interfering in someone else's relationship. That could be seen as a breach of privacy or trust. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation matters. They might have been trying to prevent the new guy from getting hurt, but maybe there was a better way. For example, they could have told the ex to be honest, but since they aren't in the relationship anymore, it's not their place to meddle. Additionally, the author's actions might have been driven by lingering anger or a desire for revenge, especially since the ex stole their friends and they feel vindicated now. \n\nAnother angle is the potential for spreading lies. The author claims the ex cheated, but the ex's side of the story, which the ex-friends believe, might be different. If the author's account is the only one being told, the new BF might not have the full picture. The author might be the only one who knows the truth, but that's not certain. Even so, sharing that information without the ex's consent could be problematic.\n\nIn many circumstances, people are expected to avoid interfering in others' relationships once they've ended. So even if the author's intention was good, the action itself is often considered wrong. It's like the classic \"Don't speak ill of your ex to their new partner\" advice. So the author is likely in the wrong because they overstepped their role by directly contacting the new BF instead of focusing on their own healing or letting the new BF find out through the ex if necessary.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
