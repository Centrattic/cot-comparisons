      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about telling an ex's new boyfriend that the ex cheated. \n\nFirst, the ex cheated on them with a gym buddy, and the author found out through a friend. They confronted the ex, she confessed, and they broke up. Now, five months later, the ex is dating someone new. The author sent her new boyfriend an email explaining the cheating. The new boyfriend broke up with her because of that info. Now the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole.\n\nSo, is the author wrong for doing that? Well, maybe. Even though the author was hurt and wanted the new boyfriend to know the truth, did they have the right to share that information? In a way, the author might feel it's justified because they would want to know if their partner cheated. But sharing someone else's private information, even if it's true, can be seen as violating their privacy. The ex and the new boyfriend might not appreciate the author interfering like that. \n\nAlso, the author and the ex are no longer in a relationship, so maybe the author shouldn't have the authority to share that information. The new boyfriend's decision to break up based on the author's email might be the result of the author's actions. The ex is now surrounded by people who believe her side, which complicates things. \n\nBut then again, the ex did cheat, and the author was truthful about it. However, the method of sharing that information might be problematic. Telling someone about a past partner's infidelity without their consent could be seen as a breach of trust. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they shared private matters without keeping it to themselves or involving the ex's new partner directly. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author had gone to the new boyfriend themselves to explain the situation, but this was done via email without any prior relationship. So, it's a tough call. But in general, sharing someone's past infidelity with their new partner isn't usually considered appropriate. The author might have acted out of hurt and a desire for justice or revenge, but it's still not their place to do so. \n\nTherefore, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
