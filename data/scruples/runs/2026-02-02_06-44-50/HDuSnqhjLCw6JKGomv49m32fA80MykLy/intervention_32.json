I only found out because one of my friends was at the gym and over heard them talking about it. I confronted her, she confessed and we ended things. It wasn't a pretty break up, she lied to a bunch of my friends and ended up stealing them. \n\nThis all went down 5 months ago, I heard through a friend of mine that she started dating a new guy. After some searching I found this guys info and sent him an email saying what happened to me. I know that I would want to know if my new GF cheated on her last partner. \n\nHe broke up with her and told her that I told him. Now she and a bunch of my ex-friends are calling me an asshole. My ex-friends don't know she cheated on me, I told them but they believe her side of the story, not mine. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who told their ex's new boyfriend about the cheating is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's ex cheated on them, they found out through a friend, confronted her, and broke up. Then, five months later, the ex started dating someone new. The author found the new boyfriend's info and emailed him about the cheating. The new guy broke it off, and now the ex and her friends are calling the author an asshole. The author sent the info because they wanted the new BF to know, thinking they'd want to know if their new GF cheated before.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's actions were based on their own experience (cheating) and they wanted to protect the new relationship. However, they didn't go through the ex to share this info but directly contacted the new BF. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, even if the ex cheated, sharing that information with a third party without the ex's consent might be problematic. The ex might have moved on, and the author's action could be seen as interfering in someone else's relationship. The author's justification is that they would want to know if their partner cheated, but that doesn't necessarily justify the action of sharing private information without permission. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that their ex's friends don't believe them, which might be due to the ex's manipulation. But that's a different issue. The main question is whether it's right to reveal someone's past to a new partner without consent. \n\nI think the author overstepped by contacting the new BF directly. Even if their intention was to help, the method was invasive. The appropriate action might have been to discuss it with the ex first, not to contact someone else. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
