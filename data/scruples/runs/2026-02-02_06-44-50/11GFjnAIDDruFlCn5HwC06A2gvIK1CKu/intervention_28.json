      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal that went wrong.\n\nFirst, the author planned a public proposal. His girlfriend said yes during the proposal but then changed her mind later. He's upset that she didn't want to actually marry him after the initial \"yes.\" She says he moved too fast by planning a public proposal without discussing engagement first. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitively leading him on.\n\nThe user thinks the author is at fault. Let me consider both sides. The author's argument is that he followed through with the proposal as planned, expecting commitment. The woman's argument is that he didn't discuss the engagement with her first, leading to her feeling pressured.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Proposing without prior discussion about the future could be seen as moving too quickly. Public proposals can add pressure, making it hard for the other person to say no in front of others. The woman might have felt societal pressure to say yes, but later realized she wasn't ready. However, the author might argue that once she said yes, she should follow through. But engagement is a mutual commitment, and if one person isn't ready, it's a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction was to end the relationship immediately. That could be seen as impulsive. Ending a relationship over a proposal rejection, especially if there's underlying issues about readiness, might not be the healthiest response. But he felt betrayed and hurt, which is understandable.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he didn't communicate his intentions beforehand, that's a valid point. Public proposals can be seen as presumptuous if the couple hasn't discussed marriage. However, if he genuinely believed she wanted to get married, maybe he's not entirely at fault. The woman changed her mind after the proposal, which can be hurtful. But she might have been overwhelmed by the public nature.\n\nConsidering all this, maybe the blame isn't solely on one side. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't discuss the proposal with her, leading to her feeling pressured, he might share some responsibility. But ending the relationship immediately could be seen as extreme. Still, the question is about his wrongdoing. If he didn't communicate, that's a problem. But the user's initial thought is that he's at fault. I need to decide if the answer is A or B.\n"
