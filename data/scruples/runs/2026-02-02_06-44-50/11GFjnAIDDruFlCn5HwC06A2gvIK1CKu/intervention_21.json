      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he proposed during a cruise, set up a big public proposal with a photographer, and she said yes. Then later, she changed her mind. He was really upset and ended the relationship, thinking she was insensitive for leading him on. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The man planned a public proposal, which might be a big step. Proposing in such a way without discussing it first could be seen as moving too fast, especially if the woman wasn't ready. She might have felt pressured, even if she initially said yes. The author thought she was insensitive for changing her mind, but she argued that he didn't talk to her about the engagement first.\n\nOn the other hand, once someone says \"yes\" to a proposal, even if they're not fully ready, it's a commitment. The woman changed her mind after the fact, which could be hurtful. The man's reaction of ending the relationship because he felt betrayed makes sense if he trusted her when she said yes. \n\nBut maybe the root of the problem is that the proposal was public and not discussed beforehand. If he had talked to her about the proposal and their readiness for marriage, maybe she would have been honest earlier. However, once the proposal was made and accepted, her changing her mind is still a big deal. \n\nSo, the key points are: Did he move too fast by not discussing the engagement first? Yes, that's a point in his favor for being at fault. But once she said yes, her retracting it is also a problem. The author ended the relationship because of her insensitivity, but maybe he should have considered that she felt pressured. \n\nBut the user thinks the author is in the wrong. The user's reasoning might be that the man didn't check in with her about the proposal method and timing, leading her to be unprepared. However, after she accepted, the woman backing out is equally at fault. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the man's actions (public proposal without discussion) were the main issue. If the woman felt pressured and wasn't ready, then the man did contribute. But if the woman's change of heart after accepting is the main problem, then she's at fault. \n\nIn the end, both might have contributed, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) context usually looks for who is more at fault. If the man didn't discuss the proposal and she was unprepared, he's part of the problem. But if she changed her mind after accepting, she's the main issue. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he moved too fast without checking in with her about being ready for marriage, leading to her feeling pressured. However, her actions after accepting the proposal also hurt him. But the main fault might lie with the man for not talking to her first.\n"
