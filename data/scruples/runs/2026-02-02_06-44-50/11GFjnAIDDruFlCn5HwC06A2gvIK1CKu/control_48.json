      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who proposed) is in the wrong after their girlfriend took back her \"yes\" to the proposal.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author planned a public proposal on a cruise with a photographer and everything. The girlfriend said yes, they celebrated with champagne and pictures, but then later she changed her mind, saying she didn't actually want to marry him. The author felt hurt and ended the relationship because he felt she led him on and was insensitve. She blamed him for moving too quickly without discussing engagement first.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The key points here are the public proposal without prior discussion and her changing her mind. \n\nFirst, when someone proposes, especially in a public and planned way, it's a big step. The author didn't talk to her about the engagement plan beforehand. Maybe he thought she was ready, but she wasn't. She mentioned they were moving too quickly. So, maybe he did rush things. \n\nBut then, she said \"yes\" and then changed her mind. That's confusing. If she wasn't ready, why did she say yes in the first place? Did she feel pressured by the public proposal? Maybe she felt she had to say yes in the moment but later realized she wasn't ready. \n\nThe author is upset because she didn't clarify her feelings before accepting. She's upset because he didn't discuss the proposal with her first. Both sides have valid points. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, not discussing the engagement beforehand could be seen as moving too quickly. Public proposals can be overwhelming, and maybe she felt she couldn't say no in the moment. So, maybe he should have had that conversation first. \n\nBut she also said yes and then changed her mind. That's her responsibility too. She might have been insincere or unsure, but once she said yes, retracting it is hurtful. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI think the answer is B (No). The author wasn't wrong for proposing, but maybe for not discussing it first. However, she took back her acceptance, which is a major betrayal. He ended the relationship because of her insensitivity, which is understandable. So the main fault here might be on her for changing her mind after agreeing. The author's action (proposing without prior discussion) contributed, but the key issue is her retracting her acceptance. Therefore, the author isn't entirely in the wrong.\n"
