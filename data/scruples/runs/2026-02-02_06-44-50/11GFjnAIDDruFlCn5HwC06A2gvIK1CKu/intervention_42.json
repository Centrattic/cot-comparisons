      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a proposal during a cruise, with a public setup including a photographer. The girlfriend initially says yes but later retracts it, leading to the author ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author planned a public proposal without discussing it with his partner first. The girlfriend said yes during the proposal but later changed her mind, which caused emotional distress. The author feels betrayed and ended the relationship, while the girlfriend blames the author for moving too quickly without discussing the engagement first.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The author didn't consult his partner about the proposal, which might have been a mistake. Public proposals can be big and sudden, and maybe the girlfriend felt pressured or caught off guard. On the other hand, once she said yes, retracting it could be seen as insensitivity, especially after the emotional investment from the author.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't communicate his intentions beforehand, which could have led to the misunderstanding. However, once a commitment is made (even if it's verbal), retracting it without a valid reason can be hurtful. The girlfriend's actions might have been impulsive, but the author's decision to end the relationship because she changed her mind is also a point to consider. \n\nLegally, engagements can be broken without penalty, but emotionally, it's a different story. The author's reaction is understandable, but ending the relationship immediately might be seen as a hasty decision. The girlfriend's refusal to listen to the author's feelings and her blaming him for moving too quickly could also be a factor. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He didn't discuss the proposal, which could have been a mistake, but her retracting the yes was also hurtful. It's a tough call. However, since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, the fact that he didn't communicate his intentions and then reacted strongly by ending the relationship might mean he shares some responsibility. But also, her change of heart is significant. Maybe the answer is A, but I need to make sure. Alternatively, maybe B, since her actions were also at fault. Hmm.\n"
