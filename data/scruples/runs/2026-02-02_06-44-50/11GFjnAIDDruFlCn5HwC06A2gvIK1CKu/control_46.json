      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is that the guy proposed on a cruise, she said yes, then later changed her mind. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The man planned a public proposal without discussing it with her first. She said yes but then decided she wasn't ready. He's upset because she led him on, while she thinks he moved too quickly without talking about the engagement first.\n\nFrom a traditional perspective, proposing is a big step. If he didn't discuss it with her beforehand, maybe he assumed she was ready. But she might have felt pressured or that he didn't consider her feelings. On the other hand, she said yes and then changed her mind, which can be really hurtful. Breaking someone's heart like that is tough, and he ended things because he couldn't handle the emotional pain.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he didn't consult her about the proposal, maybe he should have been more considerate of her feelings. However, her changing her mind after saying yes could also be seen as a betrayal of trust. \n\nBut in relationships, communication is key. If he didn't talk to her about his intentions beforehand, he might have made an assumption. She might have felt that the public proposal was too fast, and her saying yes was perhaps a reaction to the moment rather than a genuine commitment. Then her rethinking it could be her being truthful, but it's still hurtful.\n\nThe man ended the relationship, which some might see as a reasonable response given the betrayal he felt. However, others might argue that he should have been more understanding of her need to process. So, there's a balance here. \n\nIn terms of fault, maybe both did things that contributed. But the question is specifically about the author (the man) being in the wrong. If he didn't discuss the proposal first, that's his mistake. If she changed her mind after accepting, that's her fault. But the user is asking if the author is wrong. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural norms. In some views, a public proposal without prior discussion is a big move. However, the woman's change of heart is also problematic. Since the user is asking for A or B, I need to pick one. \n\nI think the man isn't entirely wrong because proposing is a significant decision. However, not discussing it first could be his fault. But her changing her mind after accepting is also a problem. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't communicate his intentions first. But others might say she's the one at fault for changing her mind. Hmm. \n\nWait, the user's setup is \"AITA she took back her yes\" and the author's question is \"AITA or is she?\" The user is the one who ended the relationship. So the question is, in this scenario, is the author (the man) in the wrong? \n\nIf the woman's reasoning is that he moved too fast without discussing, then maybe he did have some fault in not checking in with her first. But she also had the chance to say no during the proposal. However, she said yes and then changed her mind. \n\nSo maybe the fault is shared, but the user wants a binary answer. If the answer is A (he's in the wrong), it's because he didn't communicate his intentions. If B (not in the wrong), it's because she's the one who changed her mind. \n\nIn many discussions, the public proposal without prior discussion is often critiqued as being inconsiderate. So maybe A is the answer here. However, some might argue that her taking back her yes is worse. But given the options, the answer is likely A because he didn't talk to her first.\n"
