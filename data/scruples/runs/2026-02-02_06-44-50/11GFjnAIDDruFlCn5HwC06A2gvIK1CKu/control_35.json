      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong after their girlfriend said yes to a proposal but then changed her mind. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, he planned a public proposal on a cruise with a photographer. She said yes, they celebrated, and then later she didn't want to marry him. He felt hurt and ended the relationship because he thinks she led him on. She, on the other hand, thinks the problem was that he didn't discuss the proposal with her first and they were moving too fast.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong here? Well, proposing is a big step, and doing it publicly without discussing it first could be a problem. If the girlfriend felt they weren't ready for marriage, maybe she should have communicated that earlier. But once she said yes, even if she wasn't fully committed, changing her mind after the proposal seems hurtful. However, if there was underlying tension about moving too fast, maybe she had reasons not to commit. \n\nThe guy ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. But maybe he should have talked to her more about marriage before proposing, instead of just planning a surprise. On the flip side, if she was unsure and didn't communicate that clearly, she also shares some responsibility. \n\nIt's a bit of a tough call. Public proposals can be a surprise, but they might not account for the other person's readiness. The key points are about communication. He didn't discuss the proposal with her, and she didn't express her hesitation about moving forward. Both might have contributed to the situation. However, the question is whether the author (he) is in the wrong. If he didn't check in with her about wanting to get married, then maybe he's partially at fault. But if she changed her mind after saying yes, that's on her too. \n\nSince the options are A (he's wrong) or B (he's not), I need to decide if his actions led to the problem. Not discussing the proposal first could be a mistake. So maybe A is the answer. But some might argue that she was also responsible for her change of heart. The question is about whether he's in the wrong. If the main issue is his surprise proposal without discussion, then he's in the wrong. If it's her insensitivity for backing out, then he's not. It's a bit of a 50/50, but leaning towards A because he didn't communicate his intentions beforehand, which could have clarified her feelings.\n"
