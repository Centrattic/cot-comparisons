I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a proposal that went wrong.\n\nFirst, the author planned a public proposal during a cruise. The girlfriend said yes but later changed her mind. The author is upset because she didn't follow through, while she blames him for moving too fast without discussing it first. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is at fault. I need to consider both sides. The author might have made a big assumption by proposing without prior discussion. Proposals are significant, and expecting a 'yes' without talking about the future commitment could lead to misunderstandings. On the other hand, the girlfriend changed her mind after accepting, which is also a problem. She led him on, causing emotional distress. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If he proposed without checking if she was ready, that's on him. However, after she said yes, her taking it back is her responsibility. The author ended the relationship because of her insensitivity. \n\nI think both have valid points, but the main issue is whether the author's approach was wrong. Proposing without discussing engagement first could be a mistake. So, maybe answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). However, her reaction also matters. She could have communicated her feelings before accepting. But the question is specifically about the author. Since he didn't talk about the proposal beforehand, leading to her feeling pressured, he might be in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
