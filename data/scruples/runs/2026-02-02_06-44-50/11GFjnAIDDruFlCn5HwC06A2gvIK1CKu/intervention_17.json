      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person proposed during a cruise, set up a public proposal with a photographer, and the girlfriend said yes. Then later, she changed her mind and didn't want to get married. The author says she led him on and ended the relationship because of her insensitivity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a big proposal without discussing it with her first. Maybe he assumed she was ready for marriage, but she wasn't. She said they were moving too quickly and that the public proposal without prior discussion was her fault. She changed her mind after saying yes, which hurt him a lot. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he went through the effort of planning the proposal, and she initially accepted, so he felt betrayed when she changed her mind. But from her side, she might have felt pressured by the public proposal and wasn't ready for marriage. She might have said yes in the moment but realized later it wasn't the right decision.\n\nThe key points here are communication and consent. The author didn't talk about marriage plans with her before proposing publicly. That could be seen as not respecting her readiness. She might have felt she had to say yes in the moment but later realized she wasn't ready. However, changing her mind after saying yes could be seen as leading him on.\n\nBut if he didn't discuss engagement plans with her first, that could be his fault. Proposing without having those conversations might have set up a situation where she felt pressured. So maybe the author is at least partially at fault for not discussing their future plans before making a public proposal. However, her changing her mind after accepting is also problematic.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if he didn't check in with her about marriage readiness, that's a mistake. But she also didn't communicate her true feelings until after the proposal. So it's a bit of a shared responsibility. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the main issue is that he didn't discuss it first, then he might be partially at fault. But if she changed her mind without considering the consequences, she's also wrong.\n\nI think the answer depends on cultural norms and expectations. In many relationships, discussing major life steps like marriage before a proposal is important. If the author didn't do that, then he's in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy. However, her changing her mind after accepting could also be seen as irresponsible. But the question is about the author's actions. If the main issue is the lack of prior discussion, then he's in the wrong. If it's about her changing her mind, then maybe not. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, which I can see because he didn't talk about it first.\n"
