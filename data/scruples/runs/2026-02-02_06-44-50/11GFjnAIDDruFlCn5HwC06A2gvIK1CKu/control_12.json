I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this (the proposer) is in the wrong after his girlfriend said yes to the proposal but then changed her mind. The user wants me to answer A or B based on the analysis.\n\nFirst, the proposer set up a public proposal with a photographer, which sounds like a big deal. He asked for her hand in marriage, and she initially said yes. Then, later she didn't want to go through with it. He was really hurt and ended the relationship because he felt she led him on and was insensitive.\n\nThe girlfriend's side is that he moved too quickly. She might have felt pressured by the public proposal and the setup. She didn't want to get married, so she took back her \"yes,\" which is understandable if she wasn't ready. But the proposer is upset because he felt she should have discussed this before saying yes, even if it was a moment of excitement or pressure.\n\nFrom a traditional perspective, once someone says \"yes\" to a proposal, it's considered a commitment. But in reality, people can change their minds, especially if they're not emotionally prepared. The proposer's actions\u2014planning a big proposal without talking about marriage first\u2014might have been the catalyst. He might have assumed she was ready, but maybe she wasn't. Public proposals can be overwhelming, and if she wasn't prepared, the pressure of the moment could have influenced her answer, leading to regret.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend did say yes, even if it was a mistake. She could have considered the impact of changing her mind after the proposal, which might be seen as insensitivity by him. However, the proposer didn't check if she was ready for an engagement, which is a significant step. He might have prioritized the proposal method over their relationship's readiness.\n\nI think the key here is communication. Proposing is a major commitment, and while it's a romantic gesture, not discussing the next steps first could lead to this kind of situation. The girlfriend changing her mind shows she wasn't ready, but the proposer's approach might have been too hasty. So, maybe he is at least partially in the wrong for not ensuring she was ready before proposing publicly. However, the girlfriend is also responsible for her own feelings and should have been honest earlier. But since the question is about the proposer's responsibility, the answer might lean towards him being responsible for not having that conversation before the proposal.\n"
