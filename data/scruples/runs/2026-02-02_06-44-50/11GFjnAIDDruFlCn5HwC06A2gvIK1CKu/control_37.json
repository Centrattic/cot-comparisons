I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal that went wrong. The man proposed on a cruise with a setup, she said yes, but then changed her mind. He's upset and ended the relationship, thinking she's being insensitive. She, on the other hand, says he rushed things and didn't discuss it first.\n\nSo, first, I need to figure out who's at fault. The man planned a big public proposal without talking to her about getting engaged first. That seems like a big step, and maybe he didn't consider her readiness. She said yes initially but then changed her mind, which is confusing because once you say yes, that's a commitment. But maybe she was overwhelmed or under pressure.\n\nThe man feels betrayed because he set up the proposal and she led him on. She says it was his fault for moving too fast. The question is whether the man is in the wrong. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Proposing is a major step, so discussing it beforehand makes sense. By not talking about it first, he might have jumped the gun. However, once she said yes, retracting it is also problematic. But maybe she wasn't in her right mind at the moment. \n\nThe man ended the relationship because of her insensitivity, but maybe he should have considered her perspective. She might have felt pressured into saying yes in the moment, then realized it wasn't what she wanted. However, changing her mind after saying yes is still hurtful. \n\nSo, in this case, the man did make a mistake by not discussing the proposal first, which contributed to the problem. However, the woman also made a mistake by changing her answer after saying yes. But the main question is about the author, the man. Since he didn't communicate his intentions before the proposal, he shares some responsibility. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong). But maybe the woman's actions are worse. However, the question is about the author's fault. Since he didn't talk to her first, he's partially at fault. So answer A.\n"
