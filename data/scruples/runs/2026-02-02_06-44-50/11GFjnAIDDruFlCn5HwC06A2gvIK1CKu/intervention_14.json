I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author proposed during a cruise with a setup, she said yes, but then later changed her mind. He's asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author planned a public proposal without discussing the engagement with her first. She felt they were moving too quickly and didn't want to marry him. She apologized by saying it was his fault for not talking about it beforehand. The author thinks she led him on and ended things because of her insensitivity.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. Proposing can be a significant decision, and sometimes people do it without prior discussion. The woman might have felt pressured, especially in a public setting, which can be overwhelming. She might not have been ready to commit and didn't realize how hurt he would feel. However, after saying yes, changing her mind after the fact is also hurtful. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't talk about the proposal beforehand, which could have triggered her anxiety. But once she said yes, retracting it later without considering his feelings could be seen as insensitivity. However, the author ended the relationship because he couldn't overlook her insensitivity. \n\nSo, who is at fault here? Both parties might have made mistakes. The author didn't discuss the proposal first, which could have led to her feeling unprepared. She then changed her mind after the event, which was hurtful. However, the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks yes, but maybe both are at fault. Since the question is a yes/no for the author, the answer would need to balance both perspectives. \n\nBut according to the options, the answer is A or B. If the user thinks the author is wrong, but I have to decide. The key point is that the author didn't discuss the proposal first, leading to her feeling they were moving too fast. That's a significant factor. So perhaps the author is partially at fault. However, her retracting after saying yes is also an issue. But the question is about the author's wrongness. If the author didn't consult her first, that's his mistake. So the answer might be A. But the user's initial thought is that the author is wrong, so maybe the answer is A. Alternatively, since she changed her mind after, maybe not. Hmm.\n\nI think the main issue is that the author didn't have the conversation about marriage before the proposal. That's a common advice\u2014discussing major life steps before making them. So the author's mistake was not talking to her first. Therefore, the answer would be A. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't discuss it first, which led to her feeling pressured, he's at fault. So answer A.\n"
