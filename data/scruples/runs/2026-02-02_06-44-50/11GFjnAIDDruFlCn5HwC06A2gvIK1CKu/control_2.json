      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this scenario. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a proposal during a cruise, where the girlfriend said yes but then changed her mind. The author ended the relationship, and now we need to determine if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The man planned a public proposal without discussing it with his girlfriend first. That could be a red flag because proposing is a huge decision, and doing it without a prior conversation about the future might be seen as moving too fast. The girlfriend then said yes but later said she didn't want to get married. She argued that he didn't discuss engagement with her first and that they were moving too quickly. The man felt betrayed and ended the relationship because he felt she led him on.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) Did the man plan the proposal without discussing it with her? 2) Did the woman feel pressured or not ready? 3) Was the woman insensitive by changing her mind?\n\nFrom the man's perspective, he was excited and wanted to make the moment special. However, proposing without discussing the future commitment first might have been a misstep. He might have assumed she was ready, but she wasn't. The woman's change of heart could be seen as a result of her own uncertainty rather than malice, but she did agree to the proposal initially. However, she might have felt pressured during the proposal itself, leading her to say yes in the moment but realizing she wasn't ready later.\n\nThe man ended the relationship because he found her insensitivity unforgivable. But is he in the wrong? If he didn't communicate his intentions beforehand, he might share some responsibility. On the other hand, she did say yes and then retracted it, which is hurtful regardless of the circumstances.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, proposing without prior discussion can be seen as risky because it puts the other person in a spot where they might feel pressured to say yes immediately. The woman's reaction about moving too quickly suggests that the man didn't respect her readiness. However, changing her mind after saying yes is also problematic. \n\nSo, the man's mistake was not discussing the proposal and commitment with her beforehand, leading to her feeling blindsided. The woman's mistake was not being honest about her readiness at that time. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author ended the relationship because of her insensitivity, which might be justified if she wasn't truthful initially. However, if he didn't communicate properly, that's his fault. \n\nI think both parties have some fault here, but since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A (Yes) because he didn't have the conversation first. However, some might argue that she's equally at fault for changing her mind. But in the context of the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The fact that he didn't discuss the proposal before might make him partially at fault, so the answer could be A. Wait, but the options are A for Yes (author is wrong) and B for No. If the author is not in the wrong, then B. But if he shares some blame, but isn't entirely wrong, maybe the answer is A. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the main issue is that he ended the relationship because of her insensitivity, but she was insensitive by changing her mind, then maybe the author isn't wrong. It's a bit of a toss-up. But considering that proposing without prior discussion is a common point of criticism, the answer might be A. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check similar scenarios. In many cases, people are criticized for public proposals without prior conversation because it can lead to pressure. So the author's mistake was not discussing the engagement first. Therefore, he's partially at fault. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But maybe the answer is B because the woman's actions were also wrong. The question is if the author is in the wrong. If the question is whether he's the one at fault, and the woman is also at fault, but the main question is if he's wrong, then maybe the answer is A. But I'm a bit conflicted here. Another angle: the woman said yes and then changed her mind, which is hurtful. The man ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. If he didn't discuss it first, he's part of the problem. Therefore, the answer is A. But if the woman's actions were the main issue, then B. I think the key here is the lack of prior discussion, making the author partly at fault. So the answer is A.\n"
