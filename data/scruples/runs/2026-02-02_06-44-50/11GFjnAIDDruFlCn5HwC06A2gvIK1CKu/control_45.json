I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal that went wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nThe man proposed on a cruise with a planned setup, and the girlfriend said yes but later changed her mind. He's upset and ended the relationship because she didn't follow through. She claims he moved too quickly without discussing it first.\n\nSo, the main question is whether he's at fault. Proposals are a big deal, and planning a public one without discussing it with her first could be an issue. She might feel pressured. But then, after she initially said yes and then changed her mind, he ended things, calling her insensitive. \n\nHe might think he did nothing wrong, but she could see the public proposal as him not respecting her need to talk about the commitment first. On the other hand, she agreed publicly and then backed out, which is hurtful. \n\nThe user is asking if he's wrong. The answer options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no). I need to consider both sides. Proposing without discussion could be his fault, but her backing out after saying yes is also a problem. However, the question is about who is in the wrong regarding the situation. The man ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitively leading him on. But maybe he should have checked with her first instead of planning a big proposal. \n\nHmm. Typically, engagement is a mutual decision. If he didn't discuss it beforehand, maybe he's in the wrong for not checking in. But she also gave a yes and then changed her mind, which is hurtful. However, the question is about the person who wrote the story (the man) being in the wrong. So, the key point is whether he was wrong for not discussing the proposal first. If that's the case, maybe the answer is A. But some might argue she's equally at fault. The user wants to know if the author (the man) is in the wrong. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Proposing publicly without prior discussion might show he didn't respect her input. Even if she later changed her mind, he could be at fault for not talking it over first. So, answer A (Yes, he's wrong). But wait, maybe the user is looking for B. Let me check again. The man ended the relationship because he can't overlook her insensitivity. But she said it was his fault for moving too fast. So, maybe the answer is B (No, he's not wrong) because she changed her mind after agreeing. \n\nThis is tricky. I think the key is that he didn't discuss it first, which is a mistake. But she also changed her mind. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the lack of discussion is considered wrong. If so, A. If not, B. In many cases, proposing without prior discussion is seen as a misstep because it can pressure the other person. So, the answer is A.\n"
