She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about a proposal that went wrong. The guy planned a public proposal on a cruise, got a yes, but then the girlfriend changed her mind. He broke up with her because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy put a lot into the proposal, maybe even assumed she was ready. But the girlfriend said they were moving too fast. Maybe she wasn't ready, even if she said yes in the moment. Public proposals can be intense, and maybe she felt pressured. \n\nThe guy didn't discuss the engagement with her first. That could be a problem. Proposing without talking about it beforehand might make her feel like there's no room to say no. But then, she did say yes and later changed her mind. That's confusing. Why would she agree and then back out? Maybe she was flattered but not ready. \n\nHe ended the relationship because of her insensitivity. That's a big decision. But maybe he was also hurt and acted impulsively. The girlfriend thought they were moving too fast, so maybe the guy wasn't listening to her. \n\nSo, who's at fault? The guy didn't communicate his intentions beforehand, which is a mistake. But the girlfriend changed her mind after accepting, which is also confusing. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural norms and expectations. In some views, a proposal should be discussed before, not just sprung on someone. The guy might be at fault for not having that conversation. But the girlfriend's change of heart is also problematic. However, the question is about the author's fault. \n\nI think the main issue here is the lack of communication. The guy didn't talk about the proposal first, which could have set expectations. The girlfriend might have been honest if he had done that. So the author is partly wrong for not discussing it. But the girlfriend's actions also contributed. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't communicate before, maybe he's partially at fault. But the girlfriend's change of heart is also a factor. \n\nIn many cases, people consider that a proposal should be discussed beforehand. So the author's mistake was not talking to her about the engagement plans. Therefore, he is in the wrong. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A, then he is. But some might argue it's a shared fault. However, the options are A or B. The key point here is that the author didn't discuss the proposal with her first, leading to her confusion. So he's at least partially wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
