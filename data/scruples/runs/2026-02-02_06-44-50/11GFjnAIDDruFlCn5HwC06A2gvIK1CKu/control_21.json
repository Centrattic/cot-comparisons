      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he proposed to his girlfriend during a cruise in a public way, with a photographer, and she said yes. But then later changed her mind. He's upset, and she's upset too, saying it was his fault for not discussing the engagement first. He ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The man planned a big proposal without talking to her about their future. She said yes but then didn't want to go through with the marriage. She claims she wasn't ready and that he moved too quickly. He feels betrayed and ended the relationship.\n\nIs the man wrong for proposing in a public way without discussing it? Well, proposals are usually a big step, and while it's a personal decision, doing it in a public setting without prior discussion might be seen as pressuring her or not respecting her readiness. However, he's also the one who took the initiative, which is often seen as a good gesture. But she felt blindsided. \n\nOn the other hand, she said yes and then changed her mind. That's a big deal. Saying yes to marriage is a commitment, so changing her mind after the proposal, especially after celebrating, might be seen as inconsiderate. However, if she wasn't ready, maybe she had valid reasons. The key here is communication. If he didn't talk to her about the engagement before proposing, that's a problem. But if they had discussed marriage before, maybe the proposal was just the final step.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. He didn't discuss the engagement with her first, which she found fault with. She then changed her mind after he got excited. He ended the relationship due to her insensitivity. \n\nBut was he wrong to plan the proposal without prior discussion? In many cultures, men often do public proposals without prior discussion, expecting the partner to accept. However, if the partner is not ready, that's a communication issue. So maybe both sides have some responsibility here. But the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing.\n\nIf he didn't check in with her about their future plans, then he might have acted impulsively. However, proposing is a big move, and sometimes people do it without prior discussion. She might not have been ready, but changing her mind after accepting is also a problem. \n\nThe author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive for leading him on. Her response was that she wasn't ready, and he moved too fast. The key issue is whether he was wrong for not discussing it first. Since she wasn't ready, maybe he should have had that conversation before proposing. But if they had previously discussed marriage, maybe it's not his fault. The story doesn't mention prior discussions, so maybe he is at fault for not ensuring she was ready. However, it's also her responsibility to communicate her feelings. \n\nIn terms of answer, the question is whether he is in the wrong. If the answer is A, then yes. If B, no. Considering that he did propose without prior discussion, but she changed her mind after accepting, which is also a problem. However, the act of proposing without discussing might be seen as a mistake. So maybe the answer is A. But others might think that proposing is a personal choice, so B. But according to the scenario, she said it was his fault for moving too quickly. So maybe the author is not in the wrong. But if he didn't check in with her, maybe he is. Hmm. It's a bit of a toss-up, but I think the key here is that she changed her mind after accepting, which is a bigger issue. However, the question is about whether the author is wrong. Since he didn't discuss the engagement first, that's a point against him. So answer A.\n"
