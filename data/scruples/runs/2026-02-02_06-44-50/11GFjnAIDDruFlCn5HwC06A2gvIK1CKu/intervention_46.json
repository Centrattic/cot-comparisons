      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The author proposed to his girlfriend during a cruise, set up a big public proposal with a photographer, and she said yes. Then later, she changed her mind and didn't want to get married. The author felt broken, cried, and ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive for leading him on.\n\nFirst, I should consider the perspective of both parties. The author thought he was doing something exciting and romantic, planning a public proposal without discussing it beforehand. The girlfriend said yes but later changed her mind, explaining that they were moving too quickly and she wasn't ready. She also said the fault was his for not talking about engagement first. The author is upset because he felt led on, while she felt pressured by the sudden proposal.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, proposing is a significant step. Even though it's a common practice, the key issue here is whether the author should have discussed the proposal with his girlfriend first. If he didn't communicate his intentions and she wasn't ready for marriage, then maybe he did rush things. Public proposals can be exciting, but they can also pressure the other person into a yes if they're not fully ready. The girlfriend might have felt pressured into saying yes on the spot during the proposal, hence why she later changed her mind. The author didn't consider her readiness and went ahead with his plan, leading to her feeling insensitively treated when he expected commitment.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend could have been more honest during the proposal. If she wasn't ready, she might have said so immediately instead of agreeing and then retracting later. However, in high-pressure, emotional situations like a proposal, it's possible that someone might say yes without fully thinking through their readiness. The author's reaction to ending the relationship over this is another point. He might feel betrayed, but she was honest about not wanting to marry him after the initial yes. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might have made a mistake by not discussing the proposal with her first. Big decisions like marriage should ideally be mutual and discussed, not sprung as a surprise. The public nature of the proposal could have felt pressuring, making her say yes without considering her true feelings. Therefore, the author's lack of communication could be where he's at fault. The girlfriend's response about moving too quickly and not discussing engagement might be valid. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate his intentions beforehand, leading to a situation where the girlfriend felt pressured and then had to retract her yes.\n"
