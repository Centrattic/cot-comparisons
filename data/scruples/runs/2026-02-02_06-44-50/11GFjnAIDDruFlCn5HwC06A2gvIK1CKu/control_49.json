She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal that went wrong. The guy set up a big public proposal on a cruise, and when she said yes, he was overjoyed. But then later, she changed her mind and broke it off. He ended things because he felt she was insensitively leading him on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The man planned a proposal without discussing it with her first, which she took as moving too quickly. She said no after initially saying yes, which is really hurtful. He felt betrayed and ended the relationship. \n\nThe question is about who is in the wrong. The author is asking if he's the one at fault. So, was the proposal a mistake? Maybe. Proposing without discussing the engagement first could be seen as pressure. But then, she didn't clarify her feelings until after saying yes. That's a big change, which could be why he ended it. \n\nIs the woman in the wrong for changing her mind? Well, people can change their minds, but doing so after a public proposal is really hard on the person. However, the man didn't discuss the proposal with her beforehand, which might have contributed to her feeling overwhelmed. \n\nThe key points here are communication. The man didn't talk to her about proposing, which she found moving too fast. She didn't communicate her true feelings until after she said yes. Both didn't communicate well. But the man ended it because he felt she was insensitively leading him on. \n\nIn terms of fault, it's a bit of a gray area. The man might have misread the situation by not discussing the proposal first, but she also didn't clarify her stance until after the fact. However, the act of changing her mind after saying yes is a significant issue. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. The woman's actions of changing her mind and the lack of prior communication from him both play roles, but the final decision to end the relationship due to her insensitivity might be justified. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
