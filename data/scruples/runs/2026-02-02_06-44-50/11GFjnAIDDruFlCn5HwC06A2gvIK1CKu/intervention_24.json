I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he proposed during a cruise, set it up with a photographer and champagne, and she said yes. But after that, she changed her mind and didn't actually want to marry him. He was really upset, cried, and ended the relationship, saying he can't overlook her insensitivity. She claimed it was his fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: he went through the effort of a big proposal, got a \"yes,\" then found out she wasn't serious. He felt betrayed and ended things because she was insensitive. The girlfriend's perspective: she said yes in the moment but wasn't ready for marriage, and she's blaming the proposal setup for moving things too fast without prior discussion.\n\nNow, the key points here. Proposing is a big commitment, and the way he did it was public with a photographer. She might have felt pressured in the moment, leading her to say yes but not meaning it. However, once someone says yes to a proposal, it's a significant promise. She didn't take it seriously, which is hurtful. \n\nBut then she's saying it was his fault for not discussing the engagement first. Maybe he assumed she was ready, or she didn't communicate her feelings properly. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If he planned a public proposal, maybe that put pressure on her. But she didn't clarify her readiness before saying yes. \n\nHe ended the relationship because he couldn't overlook her insensitivity. His reaction is understandable if she didn't take the moment seriously. But it's possible that she was honest with her feelings after the fact. However, once she said yes, she should have followed through. \n\nSo, if the author planned a proposal without discussing the marriage plans, that could be a problem. But she accepted the proposal and then changed her mind. The main issue is her not being honest about her readiness for marriage. The author's actions\u2014ending the relationship because of her insensitivity\u2014might be justified if he felt disrespected. But maybe he should have handled it differently. \n\nI think the girlfriend is in the wrong for not being truthful about her feelings, especially since she said yes and then retracted it. The author might have made a mistake in the proposal approach, but the main fault lies with her for the broken promise. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
