I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who proposed is in the wrong here. The situation is that he planned a public proposal without discussing it with his girlfriend first. She said yes but then changed her mind later. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitve.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the public proposal without prior discussion and her change of heart. Proposing is a big step, and if he didn't talk to her about it first, that might have been a mistake. She might have felt pressured or that things were moving too fast. But then, after she said yes, he was excited, and then she backed out. That's really hurtful. The question is, who is at fault?\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. Public proposals can be romantic, but if the person isn't ready for marriage, it's a huge step. Maybe he didn't give her enough time or space to process, leading to her second-guessing. But when she changed her mind after saying yes, that's also hurtful. \n\nBut wait, the author ended the relationship because he couldn't overlook her insensitivity. However, maybe he should have had a conversation with her first before proposing. Proposing without discussing it might have been presumptuous. On the other hand, if she isn't ready, she should have communicated that earlier. But she did say yes, then changed her mind. That's confusing. \n\nI think the main issue is the lack of prior discussion. If he didn't talk to her about getting married before the proposal, he might have made an assumption that she was ready. So he's partly at fault for not checking in with her. However, her changing her mind after saying yes is also a problem. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn many cases, a proposal should be discussed beforehand to make sure both partners are on the same page. So if he didn't do that, he might be in the wrong. However, her backing out after accepting is also a significant issue. But the user is focused on whether the author is wrong. Maybe the answer is A because he didn't discuss it first, leading to her confusion. Alternatively, answer B because she didn't communicate her feelings properly. \n\nBut the user says they think the author is wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. I think the answer is A because he proposed without discussing it, which led to her feeling pressured. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me check again. If a person proposes without talking about it first, that's a problem. So the answer would be A.\n"
