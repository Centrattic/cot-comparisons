I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he proposed on a cruise, she said yes, but then later changed her mind. He's upset and ended the relationship, thinking she was insensitive. She, on the other hand, said it was his fault for proposing publicly without discussing engagement first and that they were moving too quickly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The man planned a big proposal without talking about the engagement first. That might have been a problem because proposing suddenly can catch someone off guard. She might have felt pressured to say yes in the moment but later realized she wasn't ready. He mentions they were moving too quickly, so maybe they hadn't discussed their future plans or marriage readiness. \n\nOn the flip side, once she said yes, even if she wasn't fully ready, she might have felt obligated to follow through. However, she changed her mind after the fact, which could be seen as being insincere. But maybe she wasn't being insincere; perhaps she just realized later that she wasn't ready. \n\nHe ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If he didn't discuss the proposal with her beforehand, that could be his mistake. Proposing without prior discussion might have been presumptuous. She might have appreciated being included in the conversation about their future. However, after she said yes, she went back on her word, which could also be seen as his issue if he expected her to follow through. \n\nBut the main point is whether he's in the wrong. If he didn't talk to her about engagement before the proposal, that's his fault. But if she changed her mind after accepting, maybe she's at fault for not being clear. However, the key here is that she did say yes initially, then changed her mind. So, he might feel betrayed, and she might feel pressured. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. He didn't discuss the proposal with her, leading to her feeling blindsided. She then didn't communicate her true feelings after the proposal. Both parties might have flaws here. But the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. \n\nSince he didn't talk to her first, that's a mistake. So, maybe the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But then again, she also changed her mind. However, the main issue here is whether his actions were in the wrong. If he should have discussed the proposal first, then he's at fault. So the answer is A.\n"
