We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal gone wrong. The guy planned a public proposal on a cruise, got a yes, but then the girl backed out later. He's upset and ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. She, on the other hand, said he moved too fast by planning a public proposal without discussing engagement first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The man put a lot into the proposal, maybe expecting a committed future. When she changed her mind, he felt betrayed. But she might have felt pressured by the public proposal, which could explain why she wasn't ready. Did he not talk about the engagement plans beforehand? If he didn't discuss it with her, maybe she didn't have a chance to voice her feelings. Public proposals can be overwhelming for some people, especially if they're not ready for the next step. \n\nHe might have assumed she was okay with moving forward, but she wasn't. Then again, after she said yes, she changed her mind. That's confusing. Maybe she was scared or under the moment. But then, after the proposal, when he was hurt, she blamed him for moving too fast. He ended it because he felt she was insensitive. \n\nIs he at fault for not discussing engagement plans before the proposal? If he didn't talk about it, maybe he's partly responsible for not checking in with her. On the other hand, she did say yes, so maybe she had her own reasons later. It's hard to tell. The key points are: he didn't discuss engagement plans before proposing publicly, she felt pressured, then changed her mind, leading to a breakup. \n\nI think the man's mistake was not having that conversation beforehand. Proposing publicly can be a big step and might not be the best approach if both partners haven't discussed their readiness. However, she also changed her mind after saying yes, which could be a problem. But the question is about the author's fault. The user's answer is asking if he's in the wrong. \n\nSo, if he didn't discuss engagement first, then the proposal was a surprise, which led to her feeling pressured. That makes him at least partially at fault. But then she also went back on her word. The answer might depend on cultural norms or personal values. However, in many relationships, discussing such a major decision before making a public commitment is important. Therefore, maybe he is in the wrong for not having that discussion first. But it's a nuanced situation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she's at fault for changing her mind. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he didn't pressure her, but just proposed when he thought she was ready, then maybe not. It's tricky. The key issue here is whether he should have discussed the engagement plans before proposing. If he didn't, then he's partly responsible for her sudden change of heart. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong). But some might argue it's B (not in the wrong). I need to decide based on the given info. The user wants a single answer. Given that he didn't discuss engagement with her first, leading her to feel they moved too fast, that's a mistake. So answer A.\n"
