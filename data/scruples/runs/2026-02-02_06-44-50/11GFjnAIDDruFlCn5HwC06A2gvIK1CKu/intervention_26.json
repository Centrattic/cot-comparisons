      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is a proposal during a cruise, set up with a photographer, and the girlfriend (now possibly ex) initially said yes but later didn't want to marry. The author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The author set up a public proposal without discussing it first. The girlfriend said yes but then changed her mind. The author is upset that she led him on, while she claims he moved too quickly without talking about the engagement first. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want my take.\n\nSo, the main issue seems to be about communication. The author planned the proposal, but didn't discuss the intention to get engaged with his girlfriend beforehand. She felt that they were moving too fast and wasn't ready. Her changing her mind might be because of this sudden proposal. The author's reaction is to break up, calling her insensitive, but she might feel he didn't respect her need for more time.\n\nIn relationships, big decisions like marriage typically require mutual discussion and readiness. A public proposal can be exciting but might also be overwhelming if not discussed in advance. The girlfriend could have felt pressured, especially if she wasn't prepared for the proposal. By not talking about getting engaged before the proposal, the author might have pushed her into a situation where she felt cornered, leading her to change her mind later. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was hurt and felt she was insincere. But her response indicates that the problem was his approach. Maybe she said yes in the moment but realized she wasn't ready after the public commitment. The author's decision to end the relationship is his choice, but whether he's in the wrong depends on if he acted without considering her feelings or if she was being inconsistent.\n\nI think the core is that the author didn't have an open conversation about their future before proposing. Proposing in a public setting without prior discussion could be seen as impulsive. The girlfriend's refusal to engage in that discussion beforehand might leave the author feeling blindsided, but the fault could be shared. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he didn't respect her boundaries or readiness, he might be at fault. The fact that she said they were moving too quickly suggests he didn't consider her perspective. So, the answer could be A (he's in the wrong). But maybe some would say B because he's reacting to her insensitivity. Wait, but her insensitivity might not be the case if she wasn't ready. The key is the lack of communication. If he didn't talk to her about his intentions, that's a problem. So I lean towards A.\n"
