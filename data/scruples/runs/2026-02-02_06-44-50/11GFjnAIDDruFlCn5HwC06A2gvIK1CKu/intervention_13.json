I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author proposed during a cruise, set up a big public moment with a photographer. The girlfriend said yes, then later changed her mind. The author is upset and ended the relationship, thinking she was insensitive.\n\nThe girlfriend's side is that the proposal was public without discussing engagement first. She felt they were moving too quickly and wasn't ready. She got upset, said it was the author's fault for not talking about it beforehand.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author plan the proposal without discussing it, leading to the girlfriend feeling unprepared? If they didn't talk about the engagement before, maybe the author did rush into it. The girlfriend might have felt pressured in a public setting, which is a big moment. The author might have made assumptions instead of having an open conversation.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend accepted the proposal initially and then changed her mind. That's a big emotional shift. The author might feel betrayed because she led him to believe she was okay with it, then changed her answer. But she claims she wasn't ready, so maybe she wasn't being insincere, just unsure.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong. They might think the author didn't communicate properly. But others might argue the girlfriend was indecisive.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, proposing in a public way can be a big surprise. Some people like that, others don't. If they didn't discuss it beforehand, the author might have jumped the gun. The girlfriend's reaction about moving too quickly suggests that they hadn't had that conversation, which is important for a major life decision like marriage.\n\nSo, the author's mistake could be not discussing the engagement plans before the proposal. The girlfriend's mistake could be not being clear about her readiness. But since the question is about the author's fault, maybe the answer leans towards A (author in the wrong) because they didn't have the conversation first. However, the girlfriend's change of heart after saying yes is also problematic. \n\nBut in terms of responsibility, the author might be at fault for not making sure she was truly on board before proposing publicly. Public proposals can be stressful, and if the partner isn't completely certain, it can lead to this kind of situation. So the answer could be A.\n"
