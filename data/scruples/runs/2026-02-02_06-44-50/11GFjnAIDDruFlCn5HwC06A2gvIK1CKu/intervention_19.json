I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where his girlfriend said yes to his proposal but then changed her mind. The author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author planned a public proposal, which his girlfriend didn't expect. She said yes during the proposal but later changed her mind. He felt hurt and ended the relationship, thinking she was insensitive for leading him on. She, on the other hand, thought the public proposal without prior discussion was part of the problem and that they were moving too fast.\n\nSo, the key points here are about communication and expectations. Proposing in a public, planned way without discussing the engagement first might have been a problem. The girlfriend might have felt pressured, especially if they hadn't talked about marriage before. But once she said yes, he was hurt when she took it back. The author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive, but maybe he should have considered that she might have been uncertain and changed her mind after the emotional moment.\n\nI think the author's mistake was assuming that a public proposal without prior discussion was okay. Maybe they should have talked about whether she was ready for marriage before the proposal. However, once she said yes, retracting it after the fact might be hurtful. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIf the girlfriend changed her mind after an emotional proposal, maybe she wasn't in the right frame of mind. The author's reaction to end the relationship because of her insensitivity could be seen as harsh. But if she was insensitively leading him on, then maybe she is at fault. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the author might share some responsibility for not having the conversation before the proposal, but the girlfriend also had the chance to stop the proposal if she wasn't ready. However, retracting the acceptance after the fact could be seen as insensitivity. The answer might be a mix, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nSince the girlfriend changed her mind after saying yes, she might be at fault for leading him on. But the author's public proposal without discussion could be his mistake. However, the main issue is whether he's in the wrong. If the user thinks the author is in the wrong, maybe because he didn't discuss it first, but the girlfriend's actions after are also problematic. \n\nHmm, the user's initial thought was the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A or B. Considering that the author did plan a proposal without prior discussion, which might have been a mistake, but the girlfriend changing her mind after accepting is also an issue. However, the question is about the author's wrongdoing. If the author is wrong for not discussing it, then A. But if the girlfriend is wrong for retracting, then B. \n\nI think the key here is that the author assumed the proposal was the right approach without checking with her first. That's a communication failure. But once she said yes, retracting it is also a problem. However, since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, maybe the answer is A because he didn't communicate properly before the proposal, leading to the situation.\n"
