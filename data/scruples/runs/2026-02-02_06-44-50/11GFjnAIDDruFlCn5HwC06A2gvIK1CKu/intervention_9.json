      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person proposed on a cruise in a public way, and the girlfriend said yes but then changed her mind later. The author ended the relationship because they think she was insensitively leading him on.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author set up a public proposal without discussing it with his partner first. She said yes but then realized she wasn't ready to get married. He felt betrayed and ended the relationship because she didn't tell him earlier. She, on the other hand, felt that the public proposal was a problem and they were moving too fast, hence her changing her mind.\n\nNow, to determine who is in the wrong. The author's action of planning a surprise proposal without prior discussion is a big deal. Marriage is a major commitment, and proposing without checking if the other person is ready could be seen as inconsiderate. The girlfriend's reaction that they were moving too fast suggests that the proposal was a shock, which might have contributed to her changing her mind.\n\nBut the girlfriend changed her mind after saying yes, which can be very hurtful. She might have felt pressured by the public proposal, leading her to agree in the moment but then reconsider. However, once she said yes, retracting it can be extremely damaging. The author's frustration is understandable because he went through the emotional turmoil of the proposal only to be rejected later.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author should have discussed the engagement process with her before the proposal. On the other hand, once she said yes, she should have been responsible for her commitment. But the fact that she changed her mind after the proposal complicates things. \n\nThe author ended the relationship because he couldn't overlook the insensitivity. This decision might be justified if he felt betrayed and the relationship had lost trust. However, ending a relationship over a proposal being retracted might be seen as extreme if the girlfriend was honest about her feelings after the proposal.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might share some responsibility for not discussing the proposal beforehand, and the girlfriend for retracting her acceptance. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author's actions led to a public proposal without prior communication, which pressured the girlfriend into a hasty response, he might be at fault. But the girlfriend also retracted her yes, which is a significant issue.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong (A) because he didn't communicate his intentions first, leading to a situation where the girlfriend felt pressured. However, the girlfriend's retraction is also problematic. But the question is specifically about the author. So, AITA would likely say the author is partially at fault for the approach, making him in the wrong.\n"
