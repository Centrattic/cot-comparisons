I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author proposed during a cruise with a planned setup, the girlfriend said yes but then changed her mind later, leading to the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author felt excited and planned a proposal, which is a big step. The girlfriend said yes during the proposal but later backed out. The author is upset because their hopes were shattered, and they ended the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend claimed the proposal was too sudden and public. She felt they were moving too quickly and wasn't ready for marriage. She didn't communicate her feelings before the proposal. The author argues that she should have been honest, but she blames him for not discussing the engagement first.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication and expectations. Proposing in a public way without prior discussion might have been a mistake. The girlfriend might have felt pressured or caught off guard. However, once the proposal was made and accepted, changing her mind afterward caused emotional pain. The author ended the relationship due to perceived insensitivity.\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. The author should have discussed the proposal with her beforehand to ensure both are on the same page. However, after the proposal and acceptance, retracting the \"yes\" is also hurtful. The answer might depend on whether the author's actions were considerate of her feelings. But since she changed her mind afterward, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault but could have been more communicative. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nGiven that the author ended the relationship because of the girlfriend's actions, but the girlfriend didn't communicate her feelings before the proposal, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the main issue is the girlfriend retracting her acceptance, which is a breach of trust. The author might not be in the wrong if the girlfriend's actions were the main problem. But the initial proposal without discussion could be a factor. \n\nIn many cases, people argue that proposing without prior discussion of future plans (like marriage) is a setup for misunderstanding. So maybe the author did act impulsively, leading to the situation. But the girlfriend's retraction is also a key issue. The answer might be B (No), because the author isn't entirely to blame, but it's not a clear yes. Alternatively, some might say A (Yes) for not discussing first. However, the main question is if the author is in the wrong. The user's answer is likely B, as the author ended the relationship due to the girlfriend's insensitivity after the proposal. The girlfriend didn't honor her initial acceptance, which is a bigger issue. So the answer might be B.\n"
