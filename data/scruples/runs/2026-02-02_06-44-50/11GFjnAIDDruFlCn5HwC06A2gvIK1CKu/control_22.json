I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship after the girlfriend changed her mind about accepting the proposal.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author planned a surprise proposal during a cruise. He set up a romantic scenario with a photographer, which implies he was serious and committed. The girlfriend initially said yes but then changed her mind later, leading to the breakup. \n\nThe key points here are consent to marriage and communication. The girlfriend said yes at the moment but later retracted it. The author feels hurt and betrayed, thinking she led him on. She argues that the public proposal without prior discussion made her feel pressured, hence her decision to end things. \n\nIn terms of legal and social norms, a verbal \"yes\" to marriage isn't legally binding, but emotionally, it's a significant commitment. The author's reaction is understandable given the emotional investment. However, the girlfriend might have felt overwhelmed by the sudden proposal without discussing their readiness together. \n\nThe author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. But maybe he could have handled it differently, like giving her time to reconsider instead of an immediate breakup. On the other hand, she could have communicated her feelings before accepting. \n\nSo, who is at fault? Both sides have valid points. The author might not be in the wrong for ending things after such a betrayal of trust, but he could also have approached it with more patience. The girlfriend's initial acceptance might have been hasty without considering the implications. However, the decision to retract her \"yes\" later complicates things. \n\nIn the end, the author's actions were a reaction to being misled, which is a common reason for breaking up. The answer likely is that the author isn't in the wrong (B), as the girlfriend changed her mind, and the author felt the relationship couldn't continue under such circumstances. The main issue is her changing her mind without proper communication beforehand.\n"
