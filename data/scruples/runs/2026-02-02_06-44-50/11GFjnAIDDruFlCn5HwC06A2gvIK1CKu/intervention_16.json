I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a proposal that was accepted but then taken back. The author proposed publicly with a setup, and the girlfriend said yes, but later changed her mind, leading to the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he planned a public proposal without discussing it with her first, which might have been a big surprise. She says it was his fault for moving too quickly. She didn't want to marry him and felt he didn't talk to her about engagement first. The author believes she led him on and didn't communicate her feelings.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's side, she might feel that the public proposal was a shock, and she wasn't ready for marriage. She might not have felt comfortable to say no in front of others, so she said yes publicly but changed her mind later. That would be insincere, but maybe she was overwhelmed.\n\nThe author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. He might see her change of heart as a betrayal. But was it his fault for not having the conversation beforehand? Proposals are big steps, and sometimes people do them without prior discussion. However, a yes on a cruise might not be the same as a commitment to marriage. She might not have realized the weight of her yes in that moment.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. They might argue that he didn't have that conversation and put pressure on her. But others might say she was insincere by not following through. It's a tough call. The key points are communication and whether the author assumed engagement without discussing it.\n\nI think there's fault on both sides. The author didn't talk about engagement, and she didn't communicate her feelings properly. But if the question is whether the author is in the wrong, maybe the answer is A. Because he didn't have the conversation first, which led to her feeling pressured. However, some might say she's not in the right for changing her mind. But overall, maybe the author shares some blame for not discussing it. So the answer could be A. But I need to decide if the main wrong is the author's. Alternatively, maybe it's not A because she's also at fault. Hmm.\n"
