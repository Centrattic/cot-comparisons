She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he proposed during a cruise, set up a big public proposal with a photographer, and she said yes. But later, she changed her mind and didn't want to get married. He felt betrayed and ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: he planned a big proposal, which is a significant step. He was excited and felt confident she would say yes. When she later changed her mind, he felt hurt and thought she led him on. He ended the relationship because he couldn't overlook what he saw as her insensitivity.\n\nHer perspective: She agreed to the proposal in the moment but later realized she wasn't ready. She blamed him for moving too fast and not discussing the engagement first. She might have felt pressured or that the proposal came out of the blue, making her feel they hadn't properly prepared for marriage.\n\nNow, is the author at fault? Well, proposing is a big step, and while it's personal, doing it publicly might add pressure. But traditionally, once someone says \"yes\" during a proposal, it's considered a commitment. However, maybe the relationship wasn't ready for such a step. If they hadn't discussed marriage before, maybe the proposal was a surprise. However, the fact that she said yes and then changed her mind could be seen as a betrayal of trust. \n\nBut wait, sometimes people might say yes in the moment but later realize they aren't ready. That's not necessarily a lie, but it's a tough situation. The author's reaction is understandable\u2014feeling broken and deciding to end things because he can't trust her. But perhaps he could have handled it differently, like discussing their future before the proposal. However, she also might not have been honest about her feelings.\n\nSo, who is at fault? The author might have made the proposal without ensuring they were on the same page. But once she said yes, retracting it could be seen as her not being truthful. However, sometimes people can be unsure. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not discussing engagement first, leading to this situation. If he didn't talk about marriage with her, maybe he shares some responsibility. But once she agreed, her changing her mind could be her fault. It's a bit of a gray area, but the author might not be in the wrong because once she said yes, retracting it is a betrayal, even if she wasn't ready. So answer B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
