      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The situation is that he proposed during a cruise with a public setup, she said yes, but then changed her mind later. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a big proposal without discussing it with her first. The ex says that was the problem\u2014she wasn't ready. He got upset because she led him on by saying yes but then backing out. She, on the other hand, felt the proposal was too rushed and that he didn't talk to her about engagement before doing it. \n\nSo, from her perspective, maybe she felt pressured. Proposing in a public way without prior discussion could make someone feel like they're being cornered. She might not have been ready to commit, and the public proposal made her feel like she couldn't say no without embarrassing him. That could explain why she said yes and then changed her mind later. \n\nOn the author's side, he was genuinely excited and hurt. He set up a proposal expecting a commitment, and when she retracted her acceptance, it broke him. Ending the relationship because of the way she handled it\u2014maybe he's right to feel betrayed, but is he wrong for not discussing engagement first?\n\nThe key points here are communication and consent. Proposing is a big step, and both people should be on the same page. If he didn't talk to her about wanting to get married before the proposal, that could be a mistake. She might have said yes in the moment but realized later she wasn't ready. His reaction to end the relationship because of her insensitivity might be justified if she was indeed insensitive, but if she felt pressured, then maybe he's partly at fault for not checking in with her first.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he didn't discuss engagement plans with her before the proposal, that's a misstep. She had the right to change her mind, but maybe she could have been more considerate in her response. However, his decision to end the relationship might be his choice, but the initial proposal's lack of prior discussion is a problem. Therefore, he might share some responsibility here. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate his intentions beforehand, leading to a misunderstanding.\n"
