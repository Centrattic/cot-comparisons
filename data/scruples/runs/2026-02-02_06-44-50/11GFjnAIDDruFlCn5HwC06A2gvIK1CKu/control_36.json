      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy proposed on a cruise, and the girlfriend said yes. Then later, she changed her mind and said she didn't actually want to get married. He's upset and ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy planned a public proposal, which can be a big deal. He might have thought she was ready for marriage, but maybe she wasn't. She said she didn't want to get married, which is a valid decision. But she said yes first, which is confusing. Why did she say yes if she wasn't ready? Maybe she was pressured or didn't realize the implications.\n\nThe guy is upset because her \"yes\" was a lie, so he feels betrayed. But the girl's argument is that he moved too fast without discussing engagement. Proposals can be significant steps, and maybe they didn't have a chance to talk about their future plans. If he went ahead with a public proposal without discussing it, maybe he assumed too much. She might have been caught off guard and said yes without thinking, then realized it wasn't what she wanted.\n\nOn the other hand, once she said yes, even if it was a mistake, retracting it after the fact might be hurtful. But the guy was the one who didn't discuss it with her first, which could be his fault. She might not have felt comfortable saying no in that moment, especially in public. So, maybe she said yes to avoid embarrassment or conflict, then changed her mind later.\n\nThe guy ended the relationship because he feels betrayed. But was it his fault for not talking about engagement before proposing? If he had discussed it with her, maybe they could have had an honest conversation. The key issue here is communication. If he didn't check in with her about her readiness, then he might have acted impulsively. The girl's response that she wasn't ready is valid, but retracting the acceptance after saying yes is hurtful. However, maybe she didn't realize the gravity of saying yes in that moment.\n\nSo, considering all this, the wrong here might be on both sides. The guy for not discussing engagement first, and the girl for not being honest about her feelings at the time. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is the guy, so if he didn't talk to her about engagement before proposing, that's his mistake. The girl's response that she wasn't ready is a valid reason to back out, but retracting her \"yes\" after the fact is still problematic. However, the initial fault might be his for not having that conversation. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) or B (No). \n\nBut I think the main issue is the lack of communication. If he had discussed engagement with her first, maybe the situation wouldn't have happened. So he's partially at fault. The girl's decision to change her mind is her choice, but he's also responsible for not checking in. So the answer is A.\n"
