      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal that was accepted but then taken back.\n\nFirst, the guy planned a big public proposal on a cruise. He set up a photographer and everything. The girl said yes, they celebrated with champagne and photos, but later she changed her mind. The guy is upset, feeling led on, and ended the relationship because he thought she was insensitive. She claims the problem was that he proposed without discussing engagement first and they were moving too quickly.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? Well, proposing is a big step. Traditionally, you'd talk about marriage before a proposal. If he didn't discuss engagement first, maybe he acted impulsively. However, the girl did say yes, so she might have given him false hope. She later realized she wasn't ready and retracted her acceptance. That's confusing and could be considered inconsiderate, but maybe she had valid reasons.\n\nThe guy ended the relationship because of her insensitivity. But the root issue might be communication. If they hadn't discussed their feelings about marriage beforehand, both could be at fault. The guy didn't check if she was ready, and she didn't communicate her hesitation early enough. However, retracting a \"yes\" after the proposal is hurtful. \n\nIn many cases, proposing without discussing engagement first could be a mistake. The girl might have been honest if he had talked to her first. But once she said yes, backing out publicly would be hard on anyone. The guy's reaction is understandable, but maybe he should have had the conversation before the proposal. However, the girl's change of heart after accepting is also problematic. \n\nI think both have some responsibility. But the question is specifically if the author (the guy) is in the wrong. If he didn't discuss engagement first, he made a mistake. But if the girl took back her \"yes\" without discussing it with him first, she's also in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the guy's actions were the main issue or the girl's. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I think AITA is the guy because he didn't check with her first. But others might argue the girl is wrong for retracting. However, in these situations, often the proposer is expected to ensure mutual readiness. So maybe the answer is A (author is wrong), because he didn't talk about engagement before proposing publicly. The girl's action was harsh, but the initial proposal might have been premature. So the answer is A.\n"
