      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong after his ex-girlfriend took back her \"yes\" to his proposal. The situation is that he planned a big, public proposal on a cruise, set it up with a photographer and champagne, and she initially said yes. Then later, she changed her mind, leading to the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author feels betrayed because she didn't follow through on her agreement, leading to emotional pain. He ended the relationship because he couldn't overlook her insensitivity. On the other hand, the ex claims that the public proposal was too fast and she wasn't ready, and she didn't want to marry him. She also blames him for not discussing the proposal with her first.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Was the author wrong for doing a public proposal without talking to her first? And was she wrong for changing her mind after initially accepting? The user thinks the author is at fault, but others might see it differently.\n\nIn some perspectives, proposing in a public, grand way without prior discussion could be seen as pressuring the other person. The ex might feel that the proposal wasn't genuine because it was set up in a way that pressured her into an immediate answer. She might not have been ready, and the public setting made her say yes on the spot, which she later realized wasn't her true feeling.\n\nOn the other hand, once she said yes, changing her mind afterward would be hurtful. The author had planned this big moment, got emotional, and then was betrayed. His reaction is understandable, but maybe the situation was rushed. However, if she wasn't ready, then maybe the problem wasn't entirely his doing. \n\nI think the fault could be split. The author might have done the proposal too quickly without checking in with her, leading to her agreeing under pressure. But her changing her mind after accepting is also hurtful. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering both actions and reactions, the answer might hinge on whether the proposal was planned without discussion. If she felt pressured into saying yes publicly, then the author shares some responsibility. But if she genuinely wasn't ready, even after saying yes, then maybe her responsibility is more. But the fact that she changed her mind after accepting complicates things.\n\nIn many cultures, a proposal is a serious commitment, and changing your mind after accepting can be seen as a betrayal. However, if the proposal was done in a way that made her feel forced, then maybe that's where the author's fault lies. The ex's reaction that they were moving too quickly might indicate that the author didn't take the relationship to the next step properly. So, the author might be in the wrong for not discussing the proposal first. However, the user's stance is that the author is in the wrong, which aligns with the idea that the proposal was rushed. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of her changing her mind. If she didn't mean it, she should have said no. However, in the heat of the moment, people can say things they don't mean. It's a tough spot. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might be partially at fault for the public proposal without prior discussion, which led to her feeling pressured. Her changing her mind is also a problem, but if the root cause was his rushing, then he's more in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his actions contributed to the situation where she felt she had to say yes publicly, which she later regretted.\n"
