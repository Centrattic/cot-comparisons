I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal that went wrong.\n\nFirst, the author planned a public proposal on a cruise without discussing it with his girlfriend first. She said yes during the proposal but then changed her mind later. He felt betrayed and ended the relationship. She blamed him for moving too quickly and not discussing the engagement beforehand. \n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author make a mistake by not talking about the proposal first? Public proposals can be a big deal. Maybe she wasn't expecting it and felt pressured. She might have felt that the public setting made her feel cornered, leading her to say yes and then regret it. \n\nThe author argues that she led him on, but she says it was his fault for not discussing it. The author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. But is he wrong for not considering her feelings by proposing without prior discussion?\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Proposing in a public, staged way without having the conversation first could be seen as inconsiderate. She might have needed more time to process the commitment. The fact that she changed her mind suggests she wasn't ready, which the author might have realized if they had discussed it beforehand. \n\nSo, the author's mistake was rushing into the proposal without checking in with her. He might have been so excited that he didn't consider her perspective. Therefore, the answer could be that he is in the wrong (A). But wait, she also changed her mind after saying yes, which is hurtful. But the question is about who is in the wrong. The user's perspective is that they're asking if the author is at fault for not discussing it first. \n\nAlternatively, maybe both are at fault. But the choices are A (author wrong) or B (not wrong). Since the options are binary, the site might lean towards the author being in the wrong for not having the conversation. The answer is likely A.\n"
