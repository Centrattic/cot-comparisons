      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who proposed is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy proposed on a cruise in a public way, got a yes, but then the girl took it back. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy planned a big proposal without discussing it first. Maybe he assumed she was ready because they were in a relationship. But proposing is a big step. Not talking about it beforehand could be a problem. The girl said they were moving too quickly. Maybe she wasn't prepared for marriage yet, and the public proposal made her feel pressured. She might have said yes out of surprise or to make him happy, then realized she wasn't ready. That's a common issue\u2014people sometimes say yes in the moment and then second-guess.\n\nThe guy's reaction is understandable; he was hurt and ended things. But was it his fault for not discussing the engagement first? Proposing is a significant decision, and even in a committed relationship, both partners should be on the same page. By not having that conversation, he might have acted impulsively. The girl's refusal to listen suggests communication issues. However, she could have also been clearer about her feelings earlier.\n\nThe key points are: the proposal was public and not discussed, leading to a yes that wasn't fully considered. The guy's insensitivity could be about not checking in with her about marriage readiness. The girl's insensitivity is in leading him on. So, both have some responsibility. But the question is whether the author (the proposer) is in the wrong. Since he didn't communicate his intentions, maybe he shares some blame. However, the main issue is the girl taking back her yes after the proposal. Depending on cultural or personal views, proposing without prior discussion might be seen as a misstep, but it's not necessarily wrong. The girl's actions are also problematic. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the answer often looks for who had the wrong intentions or actions. The proposer acted on his feelings without checking in, which could be seen as inconsiderate. But the girl's change of heart after a yes is also a problem. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since he ended the relationship over her insensitivity, maybe he's not the one at fault. But if his proposal was the root issue, then he might share some blame. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the girl's actions were the main issue, but there's nuance here. The community often sides with the proposer if the woman changes her mind, but sometimes they criticize the public proposal without discussion. Hmm. I think the answer is B, but I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the key is that the proposer didn't discuss engagement, which is a big step. So maybe he's partially at fault. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the girl took back her yes, she's the one who changed her mind. The proposer was hurt, but maybe he's not entirely wrong. The answer is B."
