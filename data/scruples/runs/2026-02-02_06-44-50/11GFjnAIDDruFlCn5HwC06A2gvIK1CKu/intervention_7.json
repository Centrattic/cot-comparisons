      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who proposed is in the wrong after their girlfriend took back her \"yes\" during a public proposal.\n\nFirst, the proposal was set up with a photographer and during a show, which makes it a public event. The girlfriend initially said yes but later changed her mind. The proposer feels hurt and ended the relationship because they believe she was insensitive. The key points here are the public nature of the proposal and the fact that the proposal wasn't discussed beforehand.\n\nThe proposer didn't talk to their partner about the engagement first. Planning a big, public proposal without having a conversation about marriage readiness might have set the stage for this misunderstanding. The girlfriend felt they were moving too quickly and wasn't ready, which she communicated after the initial \"yes.\" The proposer might have assumed she was ready, but maybe they didn't have that conversation yet.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also important. She blames the public proposal for the pressure and says she wasn't ready. She didn't want to hurt his feelings directly, perhaps, so she let the moment happen and then retracted. However, retracting a \"yes\" after a proposal is a huge emotional blow, and her not being ready might not be her fault entirely if the proposal was unexpected.\n\nThe proposer ended the relationship because they felt led on and hurt. That's understandable, but could they have done something differently? Maybe discussing marriage before the proposal would have prevented this. However, the girlfriend's change of heart after committing to a yes is still a major issue. \n\nIn terms of who is at fault, both sides have points. The proposer didn't check in before the proposal, but the girlfriend didn't communicate her true feelings until after. However, retracting a commitment immediately after giving it is extremely hurtful, and the proposer's decision to end the relationship might be a reaction to feeling misled, even if partially justified. \n\nBut considering that the proposer didn't have that prior conversation, maybe they share some responsibility. However, the act of taking back a yes is a significant betrayal, regardless of timing. The girlfriend's insensitivity in the moment could be the bigger issue here. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong), because while the proposer could have discussed the proposal first, the girlfriend's retraction is the more serious issue. The proposer's hurt and decision to end things isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
