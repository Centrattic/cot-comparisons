      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again. The author proposed to his girlfriend during a cruise, set up a big public proposal with a photographer, and she said yes. Then later, she changed her mind and didn't want to marry him. He felt really hurt and ended the relationship because she was insensitive. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's break down both sides. The author planned a public proposal without discussing it with his girlfriend first. She said yes but then later retracted it. He felt led on and ended things. She responded by saying that he moved things too quickly and the proposal was public without her input.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he did something big and public, which is a significant step in a relationship. He probably believed that a yes meant she was committed and that she didn't want to go through with it. He feels betrayed and ends the relationship because of her perceived insensitivity.\n\nFrom her side, she might feel that he rushed into the engagement without discussing it first. Public proposals can be overwhelming, and maybe she wasn't ready for that level of commitment. She didn't want to marry him, so she changed her mind. But she might not have realized the emotional impact of saying yes and then retracting it.\n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The author didn't discuss the proposal with her first, assuming she was ready for marriage. She said yes but wasn't prepared, and she changed her mind. The author ended the relationship because he felt she led him on. \n\nIs the author wrong for proposing without discussing engagement? Maybe. Engagement is a serious commitment, and proposing without having that conversation could be seen as moving too quickly. But on the other hand, proposing can be a natural step in a relationship. However, the public nature of the proposal might have added pressure without her prior consent.\n\nHer part: She said yes but then changed her mind. That's a big deal. When someone says yes to a proposal, it's a commitment. If she wasn't ready, she should have been honest from the start. But maybe she was pressured by the moment and then realized she wasn't ready. However, retracting her consent after saying yes is problematic.\n\nThe author ended the relationship because of her insensitivity. Is that justified? If she didn't take his feelings into account by changing her mind, then maybe. But he also didn't talk to her about the proposal first. So maybe both sides share some responsibility. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he didn't discuss the proposal first, that's a problem. He assumed she was ready for marriage without having that conversation. So in that sense, he might be in the wrong for moving too fast. On the other hand, she didn't communicate her feelings clearly during the proposal. \n\nBut the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. I need to decide between A (author is wrong) or B (author is not wrong). Considering the lack of communication from both sides, but the author's action of proposing without prior discussion, maybe A is the answer. However, the situation is complex. The answer might depend on cultural norms, but generally, proposing without discussing it first could be seen as a misstep. The author's assumption that she was ready might be the issue. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
