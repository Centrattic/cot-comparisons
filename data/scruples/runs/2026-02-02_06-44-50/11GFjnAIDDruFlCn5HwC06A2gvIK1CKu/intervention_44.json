      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal that went wrong. The guy proposed on a cruise with a public setup, she said yes, then later changed her mind. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The man planned a public proposal without discussing it with her. Maybe she felt pressured. Proposals are big steps, and if he didn't talk to her about wanting to get married first, that could be an issue. She said yes in the moment but wasn't ready, so when she changed her mind, he felt betrayed. She blamed him for moving too fast. \n\nIs the author (the man) at fault? If he didn't communicate his intentions beforehand, maybe he assumed she wanted to get married, which might not be the case. Public proposals can be exciting but might not give the other person time to think. She might have said yes in the heat of the moment but realized later. However, once she said yes, there's an expectation of commitment. But if she wasn't ready, and he didn't discuss it, he might share some responsibility. However, breaking up after she changed her mind could be his way of coping with the betrayal. \n\nAlternatively, she changed her mind after saying yes, which is hurtful. But if he didn't talk to her about wanting to get married first, maybe that's where the problem started. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If he should have discussed the engagement before proposing, then he's at fault. But if she was insincere, maybe not. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the man's actions (public proposal without prior discussion) contributed to her changing her mind. If he didn't check in with her about their relationship status, that's his fault. But if she was just not ready regardless, maybe not. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I'm not sure. Maybe both have some responsibility. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the user is asking for a binary choice, A or B, I need to pick. \n\nI think the author might be in the wrong because he didn't talk to her about wanting to get married first, leading to her feeling pressured. So answer A.\n"
