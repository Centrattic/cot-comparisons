      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a proposal that was accepted but then the girlfriend took it back. The author ended the relationship because he felt led on, and the girlfriend blamed him for proposing without discussing engagement first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a public proposal, which can be seen as a big commitment. He was excited and set up the event, but the girlfriend didn't actually want to get married at that time. She said they were moving too quickly. She didn't realize that until after she said yes, which complicates things.\n\nThe author felt betrayed because he thought she was leading him on. He ended the relationship because he couldn't handle the emotional pain. The girlfriend's side is that the proposal was a shock and she wasn't ready. She might feel that the engagement process wasn't discussed properly before the proposal, which is a valid point. Some people prefer to talk about marriage before a formal proposal, even if it's a surprise.\n\nSo, who's at fault? The author didn't check in with her about their future plans before proposing publicly. That could be a mistake. However, the girlfriend changed her mind after accepting, which is also problematic. But in relationships, people can have changing feelings. The author ended the relationship because of her change of heart, which might be harsh. On the other hand, betrayal and broken trust are serious issues.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he didn't communicate his intentions beforehand, maybe he shares some responsibility. But the girlfriend's decision to say yes and then retract it is also an issue. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the key point here is that the author ended the relationship because he felt led on, which might be a reaction to her actions. So, depending on the perspective, both might have contributed. But according to the options given, the answer has to be A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nIn many relationships, the proposal is a surprise, but discussing major life decisions before such an event is important. The author might have been too impulsive. However, the girlfriend's retraction after accepting is also a problem. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend said yes and then changed her mind, that's her fault. But the author didn't talk to her first. So maybe both are at fault. But the options don't allow for that. If the answer has to be A or B, I need to decide. The main issue here is that the author ended the relationship because of her change of heart, but maybe he shouldn't have pushed for a proposal without discussing it. Alternatively, the girlfriend's response was inappropriate. \n\nLooking at similar scenarios, people often criticize sudden, public proposals without prior discussion. The girlfriend's reasoning about moving too quickly might be valid. However, retracting a yes after a proposal is hurtful. The author's reaction is understandable. So, the answer could be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because the girlfriend changed her mind, but he might have contributed by not discussing it first. However, the main fault lies with her for taking back her acceptance. The answer is likely B.\n"
