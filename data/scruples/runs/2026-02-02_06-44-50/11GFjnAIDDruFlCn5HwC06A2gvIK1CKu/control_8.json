      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a proposal that went wrong.\n\nFirst, the guy planned a big public proposal on a cruise, set up with a photographer. The girlfriend said yes, but later changed her mind. He felt broken and ended the relationship, saying she was insensitive. She responded that he didn't talk to her about engagement first and they were moving too fast.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about communication and expectations. The man assumed she wanted to get married by doing a public proposal, but maybe he didn't check in with her about her feelings on the matter beforehand. Proposing in such a public way could be seen as not discussing their future plans, which is a big step. The woman felt pressured and wasn't ready, so she retracted her acceptance. \n\nFrom the man's perspective, he was excited and set up something special. But from her side, she might have felt that he was rushing into marriage without a proper discussion. The argument is about whether he was in the wrong for not having that conversation first. \n\nThe man ended the relationship because he felt hurt and thought she was insensitive. But maybe his approach was flawed. Proposing in a public setting without checking in could be seen as not respecting her need for a more personal discussion. However, her changing her mind after saying yes might seem flip-flopping. \n\nI think the main issue is communication. The man didn't discuss the proposal with her, and she didn't set clear boundaries earlier. But since he's the one who chose the method of proposal without prior discussion, he might share some responsibility. On the other hand, her retracting her acceptance after the proposal is also problematic. \n\nBut the question is whether the author (the man) is in the wrong. The answer might be A (yes) because he didn't talk to her about their future, leading to her feeling pressured. However, there's also the aspect that she changed her mind after saying yes. But the initial question is about who is in the wrong. \n\nIn many cases, proposing without discussing the engagement first can be seen as a mistake. So the answer might lean towards A. However, her reaction could also be considered. But the user is asking if the author is wrong, so considering the lack of communication, maybe the answer is A. Alternatively, maybe B if the woman's actions were worse. \n\nWait, the man ended the relationship because of her insensitivity. But if he didn't talk to her first, then maybe he's partly at fault. So the answer could be A. But I'm not entirely sure. Different people might have different views here. The key is that the man didn't have that conversation, which led to the problem.\n"
