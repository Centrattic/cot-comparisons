      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author planned a public proposal on a cruise, got a yes, then later the girlfriend changed her mind. The author felt broken, cried, and ended the relationship because he thought she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, the question is whether the author is at fault. From the girlfriend's perspective, she said yes publicly but then changed her mind. That's pretty confusing. Maybe she didn't realize the impact of saying yes in front of others? Or maybe she was pressured into it? She blamed the author for not discussing the engagement first, saying they were moving too fast. So, maybe she felt unprepared for such a big step, and the public proposal made her uncomfortable. That could explain why she changed her mind later. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have thought that after a public proposal and a yes, the decision was final. He probably didn't expect her to back out after all the planning and emotion. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. But maybe he should have considered her feelings more when she changed her mind. If she was scared or had second thoughts, maybe he should have talked it out instead of ending things immediately. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction: she said it was the author's fault for not discussing engagement first. That suggests she didn't feel ready for marriage, which is a big commitment. If they hadn't had those conversations, maybe the proposal was too sudden. But then again, once she said yes, even if she wasn't 100% ready, changing her mind later after a public commitment might be seen as leading him on. \n\nSo, who's at fault? The author didn't discuss the engagement, leading to a rushed proposal. The girlfriend changed her mind after saying yes, causing emotional harm. The author ended the relationship because he felt betrayed. \n\nIn some views, the author should have respected her decision to change her mind, even if it was after the yes. But he felt she was insensitive for not being honest earlier. The girlfriend might have been scared and didn't realize the finality of a public proposal. \n\nI think both parties made mistakes. The author didn't discuss the proposal with her, and she didn't communicate her feelings properly. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. If we go by the \"AITA\" subreddit's common responses, they often consider both sides. However, the author ended the relationship over this. Ending a relationship over a proposal being rejected after a yes is a big step. Maybe he should have handled it differently, like trying to understand her reasons instead of just breaking up. \n\nBut the girlfriend's actions were also problematic. She said yes publicly and then changed her mind. That's a huge emotional hit for the other person. However, the author's reaction might have been too harsh. If he ended the relationship immediately without trying to reconcile or understand, maybe he's at fault for not being able to handle the rejection. \n\nIn the end, it's a tough call. If the girlfriend changed her mind after a yes, she's partly at fault. But the author didn't prepare her for the proposal, so he's also responsible. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he ended the relationship over her changing her mind, which could be seen as not being able to handle the situation maturely. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the girlfriend is more at fault for leading him on, then the author isn't in the wrong. Hmm.\n"
