      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he proposed during a cruise with a big setup, she said yes, but then later changed her mind. Then he ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. He planned a public proposal, which is a big deal. She initially said yes but then didn't want to go through with the marriage. She said it was his fault because he didn't discuss engagement with her first. She felt they were moving too quickly. He feels she was insensitive by leading him on.\n\nFrom her perspective, maybe she wasn't ready for marriage and felt pressured. Proposing without discussing it beforehand could have made her feel caught off guard. She might have said yes in the moment but realized she wasn't ready. That's a common issue in relationships where one person is more prepared for commitment than the other.\n\nOn the other hand, the author felt betrayed because she changed her mind after saying yes. He probably felt publicly humiliated and heartbroken. Ending the relationship because of her insensitivity makes sense if he couldn't move past the betrayal. But was he wrong for not discussing the proposal first? Maybe. A big decision like marriage should involve open communication. If he didn't check in with her about where they were in the relationship, that could be his mistake.\n\nThe key points here are communication and readiness. If he didn't talk to her about marriage before the proposal, he might have overlooked her feelings or the state of their relationship. However, she also had the responsibility to be honest about her readiness. Both sides have some accountability, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong specifically.\n\nConsidering that he went ahead with a public proposal without prior discussion, which is a significant commitment, he might have made assumptions. Her changing her mind later could be seen as a result of the proposal happening too quickly without proper conversation. So, maybe the author is at least partially at fault for not ensuring they were on the same page. However, she's also responsible for not being honest about her feelings at that stage.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). If the main issue is that he didn't discuss engagement first, then he's partially at fault. But the question is if he's in the wrong. Since the user is asking for a judgment between A and B, and considering that both sides have some responsibility, but the main fault might be his for not discussing it first, the answer could be A. But I need to think again.\n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author's actions included a public proposal without discussing engagement. The ex didn't want to marry him after the initial yes. The author ended the relationship because of her insensitivity. The key here is whether the author was wrong for not discussing it first. Since the ex said that was the problem, it might be his fault. Therefore, the answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong). But some might argue that the ex was also wrong for changing her mind. However, the question is about the author's wrongness. If the main issue is his lack of communication, then A is correct.\n"
