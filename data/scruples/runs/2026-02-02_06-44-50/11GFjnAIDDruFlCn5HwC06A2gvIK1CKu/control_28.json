      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading through their situation carefully.\n\nThe user set up a public proposal with a photographer and everything. His girlfriend (now ex) said yes, but then later changed her mind and didn't want to marry him. He was really upset and ended the relationship, believing she was insensitive. She, on the other hand, said it was his fault for moving too quickly and not discussing the engagement first. He's asking if he's the one at fault here.\n\nFirst, the proposal was a big step. Proposing is a significant commitment, and the way he did it was public. Maybe he didn't discuss it with her beforehand, which could have caused problems. She mentioned they were moving too quickly, so perhaps there were underlying issues about commitment or readiness that weren't addressed before the proposal.\n\nHe seems to think she led him on by saying yes and then backing out. But she said she didn't want to marry him after the proposal. That might be her own issue, but if he didn't talk to her about the engagement plans first, he might have jumped the gun. Proposing without discussing it could have been a mistake, as she wasn't ready for that level of commitment yet.\n\nHe ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. But maybe he also acted impulsively in proposing publicly without having that conversation. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If he didn't communicate his intentions with her and she wasn't ready, he might share some responsibility. However, she changed her mind after saying yes, which is also a problem.\n\nSo, considering both sides: he didn't discuss the proposal with her first, which could be a mistake, and she didn't clarify her feelings. But the act of changing her answer after saying yes is hurtful. However, the initial proposal might have been premature. It's a bit of a toss-up, but maybe he's partially at fault for not having the conversation beforehand. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer might be B (No) because she also made a mistake, but maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. Wait, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he didn't communicate, maybe he's partly at fault. However, she's the one who changed her answer. Hmm. \n\nIn some perspectives, proposing without discussing it is a misstep, but the main issue is her changing her mind. The author ended the relationship because of her insensitivity. So, depending on cultural or personal views, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if he didn't talk to her, maybe he's partially to blame. But the question is if he's in the wrong. If the answer is A (Yes) or B (No). The user is asking if he's the one at fault. Given that the girl changed her answer after saying yes, which is hurtful, but the proposal might have been rushed. However, the main fault might lie with her for changing her mind after the proposal. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
