      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author proposed to his girlfriend during a cruise, which he set up with a photographer and everything. She said yes, and they celebrated with champagne and pictures. Then later, when they went back to the room, she changed her mind and didn't want to marry him. He was really upset and ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive by leading him on. She, on the other hand, thought he moved too quickly by planning a public proposal without discussing the engagement first. The author is asking if he's in the wrong (AITA).\n\nThe user thinks the author is at fault. I need to consider both sides. \n\nFirst, from the author's perspective: He went through a lot of effort to plan a public proposal, which is a big commitment. When she said yes, he was happy and then was crushed when she changed her mind. Ending the relationship because of what he sees as insensitivity makes sense to him. He might feel that she didn't communicate her feelings properly and led him on, causing emotional pain.\n\nFrom her perspective: She might have not been ready for marriage and felt that the proposal was too public and sudden. She could have felt pressured or that he didn't discuss the engagement with her first, making her feel like he was moving too fast. Her changing her mind afterward could be her way of realizing she wasn't ready, even if she said yes in the moment.\n\nThe key issues here are communication and expectations. Proposing is a major step, and both partners should be on the same page. If he went ahead with a public proposal without discussing it with her first, maybe he did move too quickly. However, she also said yes and then changed her mind, which is hurtful. \n\nIs the author at fault for not discussing the engagement more beforehand? Or is she at fault for changing her mind after saying yes? \n\nIn many relationships, proposing can be a big surprise, but it's also important to have the conversation about marriage before the proposal. If he didn't talk to her about wanting to get married and then did a public proposal, maybe he didn't give her a chance to express her feelings. On the other hand, she did say yes initially, so maybe she had a change of heart after the fact, which is a problem. \n\nEnding the relationship because of this might be a reaction to the pain he felt. But was he wrong to plan the proposal without discussing it first? That could be a point of contention. If she felt pressured, that's a valid concern. However, after the proposal, changing her mind and not taking back the \"yes\" could be seen as insincere. \n\nI think there's some fault on both sides. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he didn't discuss the proposal with her and she felt it was too rushed, then he might share some responsibility. However, her changing her mind after saying yes is also a problem. \n\nIn terms of the answer, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if that's accurate. If the author didn't communicate his intentions before the proposal, that's a mistake. But if she changed her mind later, that's her fault. However, the author ending the relationship because of her insensitivity might be his way of dealing with the hurt, which could be justified. \n\nI think the answer is that the author is not in the wrong (B) because while he could have discussed the proposal more, her sudden change of heart was the main issue. But maybe there's a balance here. Alternatively, if the author didn't talk to her about marriage first, then he's at fault. But the key is that she changed her mind after agreeing, which is a problem. So maybe the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because she changed her mind after saying yes, which is a bigger issue than the proposal setup.\n"
