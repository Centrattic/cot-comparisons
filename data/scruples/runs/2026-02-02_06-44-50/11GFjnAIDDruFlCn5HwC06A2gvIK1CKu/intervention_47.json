We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a proposal that went wrong, leading to a breakup. \n\nFirst, the author planned a public proposal without discussing engagement first, which the girlfriend (now ex) took back. She said yes initially but then changed her mind, leading to the author ending the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. I need to assess both sides. The key points here are the public proposal setup, the immediate reaction, and the aftermath.\n\nThe author's actions: Planning a proposal without prior discussion. This could be seen as impulsive, especially if the relationship wasn't ready. Public proposals can be stressful and might feel pressuring. The ex's response was to say yes initially but then retract, which is confusing. Her reasoning was that they were moving too fast and she wasn't ready. \n\nThe ex's actions: She agreed to the proposal on the spot but later changed her mind. This inconsistency could be due to not being emotionally ready. When confronted, she blamed the author for moving too quickly. The author felt betrayed and ended the relationship, which he might see as justified.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationship advice, communication is key in major life decisions like marriage. Proposing without prior discussion might be a misstep. However, the ex's behavior of leading someone on and then retracting the commitment is also problematic. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong for not discussing the proposal, but the ex's actions of retracting after the proposal are equally if not more problematic. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not who's more to blame. The author could argue that the ex's insensitivity (changing her mind without clear communication) led to the breakup, hence he's not at fault. But if the author didn't create space for discussion, that's his fault too.\n\nBut in this case, the author ended the relationship because he couldn't overlook her insensitivity. So, the question is whether the author's actions (planning the proposal without discussion) contributed to the problem. It's a mutual issue, but the question is if he's in the wrong. \n\nIn many cases, proposals should be discussed beforehand. So, the author might be in the wrong for not having that conversation. However, the ex's response of retracting after the proposal is also a significant issue. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and considering relationship advice, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) for not discussing the proposal first. But some might argue that the ex's actions were worse. However, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, which aligns with the idea that the proposal should be discussed beforehand. \n\nBut the key here is the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the answer options are A or B. Based on the scenario, the answer could be A because the author didn't communicate his intentions first, leading to the situation. However, others might say the ex is more at fault. But the user wants to know if the author is wrong. So, given that, the answer might be A. However, I need to make sure. The user's own thought is that the author is in the wrong, so the answer might be A. But I need to be careful because sometimes people assume the proposer is right, but in this case, the problem was that the proposal wasn't discussed. So, answer A.\n"
