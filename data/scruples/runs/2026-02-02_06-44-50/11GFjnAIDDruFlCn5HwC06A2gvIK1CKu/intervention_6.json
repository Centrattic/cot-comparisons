I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a proposal that went wrong. The man proposed on a cruise with a setup, and the woman initially said yes but then changed her mind. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. The user's initial thought is that the author is at fault, but they want another perspective.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The man planned a public proposal, which can be a big deal. Proposals are usually meant to be romantic and celebratory, but they can also be stressful. The woman said yes initially but then changed her mind. That's a significant change of heart. The man felt hurt and ended the relationship because he thought she was insensitive. \n\nOn the other hand, the woman's reaction suggests that the proposal was unexpected. She mentioned that he moved too quickly without discussing the engagement first. That indicates that maybe he didn't communicate his intentions properly or check if she was ready for that step. Public proposals can sometimes be overwhelming if one partner hasn't had the conversation privately first. \n\nSo, the key points here are communication and mutual readiness. If the man hadn't discussed the engagement with her beforehand, then maybe he did rush things. Proposals should ideally come after both partners are on the same page. However, the woman changing her mind after saying yes is also problematic. Once a proposal is accepted, there's an expectation that the commitment is real. Changing your mind afterward can be hurtful and might indicate a lack of serious intention during the proposal.\n\nBut the man ended the relationship right then, which is a huge decision. The woman's insensitivity could be about the way the proposal was handled, but his reaction of ending things immediately after might be hasty. However, if the woman was truly insensitive and didn't consider his feelings, then the man's decision could be justified.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might share some blame. The man for not discussing it first, and the woman for changing her mind. But the question is whether the author (the man) is in the wrong. If the main issue is that he didn't communicate his intentions, then yes, he might be at fault. However, the woman's actions were also hurtful. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is wrong, which aligns with the idea that the man didn't check if she was ready. But if the woman's refusal was sudden and without prior discussion, maybe the man isn't entirely wrong in ending the relationship. It's a tricky situation where both parties have some responsibility, but the core issue is communication. \n\nIn conclusion, the man might be at fault for not discussing engagement plans first, leading to a rushed proposal. The woman's change of heart is also problematic, but the root cause could be his lack of communication. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't ensure they were both ready before proposing publicly.\n"
