I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a proposal that was accepted but then retracted. The key points here are the public proposal setup without prior discussion and the ex's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author planned a surprise proposal during a cruise with a photographer. The girlfriend said yes initially but later changed her mind. The author feels hurt and ends the relationship, blaming her for insensitivity. She, on the other hand, says the problem was the public proposal without discussing the engagement first.\n\nSo, was the author wrong? Well, proposing in a public setting without discussing it beforehand might have been a mistake. Engagement is a big step, and planning a surprise could lead to pressure. The girlfriend's decision to retract her acceptance might be due to not feeling ready, which is her right. However, the author's reaction to ending the relationship over this could be seen as taking it personally, possibly not allowing space for her to reconsider or discuss further. The question is whether the author's approach was wrong by not discussing the engagement plans first, leading to the misunderstanding. On the other hand, her changing her mind after accepting could also be an issue. But since the user is asking specifically about the author's fault, the main point is whether he was wrong. The answer might lean towards B (No), as the girlfriend's response is also a factor, but some might argue the author should have discussed it first. However, given the context, the answer is likely B.\n"
