We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he proposed on a cruise during a show with a photographer, and she said yes. Then later, she changed her mind and didn't want to marry him. He was really upset and ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. She, on the other hand, said that he moved too quickly by not discussing the engagement first and that he planned a public proposal without talking about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of both parties. The author thought he had her consent and was excited, but she later backed out. He felt betrayed because she led him on. On the other hand, she might have felt pressured by him not discussing the engagement properly and doing it publicly. \n\nMarriage is a big step, and communication is key. If he proposed without discussing their readiness for marriage, maybe he should have checked in with her first. Public proposals can be overwhelming and might pressure someone into saying yes on the spot even if they're not sure. She might have felt she couldn't say no in that moment, which is why she changed her mind later. \n\nThe author ended the relationship because of her insensitivity, but her response was that he moved too quickly. It's a bit of a cycle here. If he didn't talk to her about the engagement first, maybe he shares some responsibility. But she did say yes, which implies she was okay with it at that moment. However, she changed her mind, which could be seen as a change of heart rather than insensitivity. \n\nI think the key issue is whether he should have discussed the proposal more thoroughly before doing it publicly. Public proposals can put pressure on someone to say yes immediately, which might not be the best way to approach such a significant decision. So maybe the author did act too quickly without proper communication. However, she did say yes, and then went back on it, which could also be a problem. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't discuss the engagement with her first and chose a public setting, that could be seen as his mistake. He might have assumed she was ready without confirming. Her changing her mind was her responsibility, but maybe he should have been more cautious. However, she also has the right to change her mind if she wasn't ready. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties could have handled it better. But the question is about the author's actions. Since he didn't talk to her about the proposal first and forced a public scenario, he might be at fault. Therefore, the answer could be A. But I'm a bit conflicted because her actions also contributed. However, the user's initial thought was that the author is in the wrong, so maybe A is the right choice here.\n"
