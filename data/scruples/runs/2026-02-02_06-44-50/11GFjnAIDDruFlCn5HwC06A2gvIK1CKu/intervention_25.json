      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a proposal during a cruise, where the girlfriend says yes, they celebrate, and then later she changes her mind, leading to the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The proposer set up a public proposal without discussing engagement first. The girlfriend says it's the proposer's fault for moving too quickly. She changed her mind after the proposal, which caused emotional distress. The proposer ended the relationship because he felt led on.\n\nFrom the proposer's perspective, he might feel betrayed because she initially said yes and then retracted it. He could argue that she should have been honest about her feelings before accepting. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel pressured into a public proposal without prior communication about their future. She could believe that the proposer didn't respect her readiness for such a commitment.\n\nThe key points here are communication and consent. The proposer didn't discuss the engagement plan with her beforehand, which she found to be moving too fast. Her changing her mind after accepting might stem from not feeling ready, but she did accept the proposal. However, the initial lack of communication about their readiness for marriage could be a significant factor here.\n\nThe proposer ended the relationship due to her insensitivity, but perhaps the root issue was the lack of prior discussion. If the proposer had checked in with her about their engagement plans, maybe the situation could have been avoided. However, once he proposed and she accepted, retracting that acceptance could be hurtful regardless. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might share some blame. The proposer didn't communicate the proposal plan, and the girlfriend didn't clarify her feelings before accepting. However, the question is whether the proposer is in the wrong. If the main issue is the public proposal without prior discussion, then the proposer might share some fault. But since the girlfriend changed her mind after saying yes, that could be her fault as well. \n\nThe user thinks the proposer is in the wrong, so I need to consider if that's accurate. The answer depends on whether the proposer's actions (proposing without discussion) were the primary issue. If so, then the answer would be A. If the girlfriend's retraction is the main problem, then B. Given that the proposer didn't discuss the proposal first, that could be a misstep, but the girlfriend's actions after accepting are also problematic. However, the proposer's decision to end the relationship might be justified if he felt betrayed. It's a nuanced situation where both have some responsibility, but the initial question is about the proposer's fault. Since the user thinks the proposer is in the wrong, I need to see if that's valid. The answer could be A if the proposer's lack of communication is the primary issue. However, if the girlfriend's retraction is the main problem, then B. The answer might hinge on cultural norms around proposals and consent. In many contexts, a proposal is a personal decision, but not discussing it first could be seen as moving too fast. Hence, the proposer might share some blame. So, the answer could be A.\n"
