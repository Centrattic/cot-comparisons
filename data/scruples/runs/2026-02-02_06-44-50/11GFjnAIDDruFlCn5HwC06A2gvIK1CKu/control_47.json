She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a proposal that the girlfriend accepted but then changed her mind, leading to the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a public proposal without discussing it first. The girlfriend felt that they were moving too quickly and didn't want to get married. She said yes in the moment but later realized she wasn't ready. The author is upset because she changed her mind, but she attributes the problem to him not discussing the proposal beforehand.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? The author might be in the wrong for not talking about the proposal first. Big life decisions like marriage should be discussed in private, not sprung on someone in a public setting. The girlfriend might have been pressured into saying yes immediately because of the setup. On the other hand, the girlfriend could be blamed for not being clear about her feelings earlier. But it's possible she didn't realize her own feelings until that moment. \n\nThe key point is whether the author should have discussed the engagement plan before the proposal. Since they were in a relationship, the expectation is that such a significant step would involve mutual discussion. The girlfriend might have felt blindsided, leading her to say yes when she wasn't truly ready. Therefore, the author's lack of communication could be the main issue here. However, the girlfriend's change of heart after saying yes is also a problem. But since the question is about the author being in the wrong, the main fault lies with him for not discussing it first. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
