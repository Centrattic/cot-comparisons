I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy proposed on a cruise, she said yes, but then changed her mind. He was really upset, and she said it was his fault for doing a public proposal without discussing the engagement first. He broke up with her because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nHmm, first, proposing is a big step. But he did plan it secretly, which she didn't like. She thought they were moving too fast. Maybe he should have talked to her first about getting engaged instead of surprising her. On the other hand, she said yes initially and then backed out. That's pretty hurtful too. She might have realized after the fact that she wasn't ready, but leading someone on isn't good either. \n\nThe guy ended the relationship because he felt betrayed. But does he have a point? If she changed her mind after saying yes, that's not great. However, her reason for changing her mind is that they were moving too fast. Maybe there's a middle ground here. But he didn't discuss the proposal with her, which could have been a problem. So both sides have some fault? Or is it more her fault for changing her mind after the fact? Or his for not talking things through?\n\nI think the key points are: he didn't discuss the proposal with her first, which she found hurtful. She later changed her mind after saying yes. Both actions are problematic. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, he did set up a public proposal without her input. That might be a mistake. But she also went back on her yes. So maybe it's a bit of both? However, the user is asking specifically about the author's wrongdoing. Since he didn't check with her first, which she said was the issue, maybe he's partly to blame. But she also changed her mind after accepting. So maybe the answer is a mix, but according to the options, it's either A (yes he's wrong) or B (no). \n\nIn these kinds of situations, people often say that you should discuss a proposal before doing it. So he not discussing it with her first could be his fault. But she also wasn't honest about her feelings. So maybe the answer is A because he didn't talk to her first. But others might say she's equally at fault. The choices are A or B. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. Based on the reasoning that he didn't discuss the proposal with her, which she found hurtful, leading to her changing her mind. So AITA would depend on whose fault it is. If the main issue is his not discussing, then he's in the wrong. But if the main issue is her changing her mind, then she is. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he didn't check with her, maybe the answer is A. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the answer is B because she changed her mind after saying yes. Hmm.\n"
