I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after their girlfriend took back her \"yes\" to a proposal. \n\nFirst, the author proposed in a public way with a setup, and the girlfriend initially said yes but then changed her mind. The author feels hurt and ended the relationship because he thinks she was insensitively leading him on. The girlfriend's side is that the proposal was too sudden and public, and she wasn't ready.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? From the author's perspective, he set up a proposal without discussing it beforehand. Maybe he assumed she was ready because she said yes initially. But the girlfriend felt pressured, especially with the public nature of the proposal. She might not have been ready for the commitment, and the sudden setup made her realize she wasn't.\n\nThe author ended the relationship because he thinks she was insensitively leading him on. But maybe he didn't give her enough time or opportunity to process. The girlfriend's reaction could stem from feeling overwhelmed. Public proposals can be stressful, and maybe she felt cornered into a quick yes.\n\nIs the author wrong? He didn't discuss the proposal with her first. Jumping into a public proposal without prior discussion might have been too fast. He might have missed signs that she wasn't ready. On the other hand, she could have been clearer about her feelings instead of leading him on.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: public proposal without discussion, leading her on, and not considering her readiness. The girlfriend's response might be valid if she felt pressured. However, the author could have approached it differently. But in terms of fault, maybe the author is partially at fault for not discussing it first. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong entirely. The answer might be B (No), because the girlfriend changed her mind, which is her right, but the author's reaction might be justified given the circumstances. Alternatively, the author could have handled it better, but the main issue is the girlfriend's change of heart. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
