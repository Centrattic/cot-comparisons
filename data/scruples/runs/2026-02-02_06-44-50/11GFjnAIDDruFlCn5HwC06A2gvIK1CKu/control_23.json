      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal that went wrong. The guy proposed on a cruise with a photographer and everything, and she said yes. But then later she changed her mind and said she didn't want to actually marry him. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points here. The man planned a big proposal without discussing it first. The woman said yes initially but then changed her mind. He's upset and ended the relationship, blaming her for leading him on. She, on the other hand, felt they were moving too quickly and didn't want to get engaged yet. She didn't feel they discussed the engagement first before the proposal.\n\nSo, in terms of responsibility, there are two sides. The man's perspective is that she should have been honest from the start. The woman's perspective is that he moved too fast without talking about the commitment first. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Proposing is a huge commitment, and doing it without discussing whether both partners are ready can definitely be a problem. However, the woman did say yes in the moment. Then later, she changed her mind, which is also an issue. Once someone says yes to a proposal, that's a commitment, even if it's verbal. \n\nThe man's reaction of ending the relationship because she changed her mind might be justified, but so might her initial hesitation. But the fact that she said yes and then later changed her mind could be seen as leading him on, which the man felt was insensitive. \n\nBut also, the man didn't discuss the proposal with her first. Maybe he assumed she was ready. So both might have missteps. However, the question is whether the author (the man) is in the wrong. \n\nIf the woman changed her mind after saying yes, that's a big issue. But if the man didn't check in with her before proposing, that's also a problem. In many cultures, a verbal \"yes\" is considered a binding commitment, so retracting it could be seen as a betrayal. \n\nThe man ended the relationship because of her insensitivity, which is his right. But the question is about whether he is in the wrong. If he didn't communicate his intent to propose, perhaps he's partially at fault. However, the woman's change of heart after saying yes is problematic. \n\nI think the answer here is that the woman made a mistake by changing her mind after agreeing. The man also didn't check in before proposing, but the immediate responsibility for retracting a commitment lies with her. So the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
