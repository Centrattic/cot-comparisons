      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal that went wrong. The guy proposed on a cruise in a public setting with a photographer, she said yes but then changed her mind. He's upset and ended the relationship, and he's wondering if he was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The man planned a surprise proposal without discussing it with his girlfriend first. She initially said yes but then changed her mind. He felt led on and ended the relationship because he couldn't overlook her insensitivity. She blamed him for moving too fast and not discussing the engagement first.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. The main factors here are communication and intent. Proposing is a big step, and doing it without prior discussion could be seen as a misstep. She might have felt pressured or that he wasn't considering her readiness. On the other hand, she did say yes initially, then changed her mind, which is also a problem. But the author's reaction\u2014ending the relationship\u2014could be justified if he felt betrayed.\n\nBut the core issue is whether the author is in the wrong. The woman's reaction suggests that the proposal came as a surprise, which she wasn't prepared for. If they hadn't discussed the future, he might have assumed she was ready, but she wasn't. However, the author's decision to propose without talking about it first could be seen as a mistake. So, maybe the answer is A, he is in the wrong. But then again, she did change her mind after saying yes, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe both are at fault. But the question is specifically about the author. The user wants to know if he's wrong. The key point here is that he proceeded with a public proposal without discussing their future together first. That's a significant step, and not checking in with her could have set the stage for the misunderstanding. So, yes, he might be in the wrong for not having that conversation first. But she also changed her mind after agreeing, which is hurtful. However, the question is about the author's fault. The answer might lean towards A because he didn't discuss the proposal with her first, which led to her feeling pressured. Therefore, he's partially at fault.\n"
