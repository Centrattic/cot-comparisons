I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a proposal that got rejected after the initial \"yes.\" The author set up a public proposal with a photographer, and the girlfriend said yes but later changed her mind. The author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive for leading him on. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down both sides. The author planned a big proposal without discussing the engagement first. The girlfriend said she wasn't ready and felt the proposal was too sudden. The author ended the relationship, citing her insensitivity. The girlfriend's argument is that the proposal was planned without discussion, so it's the author's fault for moving too fast.\n\nSo, the key points are: 1) Did the author act inconsiderately by planning a public proposal without talking about engagement first? 2) Did the girlfriend have a right to change her mind after the initial \"yes\"? 3) Was ending the relationship an appropriate response?\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, proposals are significant and should be mutual decisions. Jumping into a public proposal without prior discussion could be seen as moving too fast. The girlfriend's hesitation might indicate that she wasn't fully on board, so the author might have triggered her by not discussing it first. However, once she said \"yes,\" even if under pressure or confusion, the author might feel betrayed when she retracts it.\n\nBut the author's response of ending the relationship immediately because of her insensitivity could be harsh. The girlfriend's change of heart might be a sign of her own uncertainty, not insensitivity. The author could have tried to understand her reasons instead of cutting things off. On the other hand, if the author felt deeply hurt and couldn't move past it, ending the relationship might be his right.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he forced the proposal without discussing it, that's a mistake. But if the girlfriend changed her mind after saying yes, that's also a problem. The answer depends on whether the initial planning was the author's fault. Since the girlfriend said the author was at fault for not discussing it first, and the user thinks the author is in the wrong, maybe the answer is A. But I'm a bit conflicted because both sides have valid points. However, the act of planning a proposal without communication is a traditional point of conflict in such scenarios. So, likely A.\n"
