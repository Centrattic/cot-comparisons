      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who proposed) is in the wrong after their girlfriend said yes to the proposal and then changed her mind.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author planned a public proposal during a cruise with a photographer. The girlfriend said yes, but later didn't want to marry him. She blamed him for moving too fast and not discussing the engagement first. The author felt hurt and ended the relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here are:\n\n1. The author wanted to propose and did it publicly without prior discussion. The girlfriend felt this was too rushed. Public proposals can be exciting, but maybe they didn't have a private conversation first. That could be a problem because big decisions like marriage should be discussed, not just sprung on someone, even if it's romantic.\n\n2. The girlfriend changed her mind after saying yes. That's really hurtful. Once someone says yes, especially in a public setting, it's a commitment. Backing out could break the partner's trust and cause emotional pain. However, maybe she realized she wasn't ready and felt pressured. But retracting a \"yes\" is still a big issue.\n\n3. The author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. He might be right in feeling betrayed, but was the proposal the right approach? If they didn't discuss the future before, maybe the public proposal was a mistake.\n\nBut then again, once she said yes, changing her mind is her responsibility. The author could have been too impulsive, not checking if she was on the same page. But she also had to deal with the consequences of her initial \"yes.\"\n\nIn terms of accountability: both might have some fault. The author didn't discuss engagement, leading to a rushed proposal. The girlfriend didn't communicate her feelings properly after the proposal. However, retracting a commitment after saying yes is a major betrayal. The author's reaction is understandable, but was he wrong for not talking first?\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nI think there's a shared fault here. The author didn't talk about marriage before the proposal, which could have led to the girlfriend feeling pressured. But the girlfriend changing her mind after saying yes is also a problem. However, the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. Since he didn't discuss the proposal first, that's his fault. So maybe the answer is A (Yes). But others might argue that the girlfriend is more at fault for changing her mind. It's tricky. In relationships, both parties need to communicate. If the author didn't talk about the engagement first, he's partly responsible. The girlfriend didn't handle the situation well either. So, maybe the answer is A, but there's nuance. However, since the options are A or B, and the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would be A because he didn't discuss it first, leading to this conflict. But some might say the girlfriend is more at fault. Hmm. I'm a bit torn here. But according to the options given, the answer is either A or B. Based on the scenario, the author is in the wrong for not discussing the proposal first, making A the correct answer. However, the girlfriend's actions are also problematic. But the question is about the author's fault. So, I think the answer is A.\n"
