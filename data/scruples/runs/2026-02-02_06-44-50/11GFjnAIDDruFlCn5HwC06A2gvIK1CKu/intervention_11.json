I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author proposed during a cruise, set up a big, public proposal with a photographer, and the girlfriend said yes. But then later, she changed her mind and didn't want to get married. The author ended the relationship because he felt she led him on and was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author planned a public proposal without discussing engagement first. The girlfriend said yes but later changed her mind, leading to the breakup. The author is blaming her for insensitivity, while she blames him for moving too quickly.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. The author didn't discuss the engagement plan with his partner beforehand. Public proposals can be very emotional and might pressure the other person. Maybe he didn't consider her readiness or communication preferences. On the other hand, the girlfriend said yes and then changed her mind, which is hurtful. She didn't clarify her feelings before agreeing. The author ended the relationship immediately, which might have been an overreaction, but her actions were also insincere.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't talk about the engagement first, so he might have assumed she was ready. However, she didn't communicate her true feelings either. Both have some responsibility. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. He planned a public proposal without discussing it, which could be seen as pressuring her. His reaction was to end the relationship, which is a strong move. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural norms around proposals. In some contexts, a public proposal is a big deal, and the other person's agreement should be firm. However, if she wasn't ready, she should have been honest. The author's actions led to a situation where she felt cornered. But she also changed her mind after saying yes, which is hurtful. \n\nI think both have some fault, but the question is about the author specifically. The user thinks the author is wrong, possibly because he didn't discuss the proposal first. The answer could be A (author is wrong) because he didn't communicate his intentions properly, leading to the misunderstanding. Alternatively, B (not wrong) if the girlfriend's change of heart is her fault. But since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and considering that the author didn't discuss the proposal with her first, maybe he's at fault for not ensuring mutual readiness. So I lean towards A.\n"
