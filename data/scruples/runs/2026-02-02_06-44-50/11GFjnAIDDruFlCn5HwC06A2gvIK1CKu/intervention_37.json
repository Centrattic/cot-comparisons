I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The situation is about a proposal that went wrong. The author set up a public proposal, got a yes, but then the girlfriend changed her mind. The author ended the relationship because she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author might have rushed into a public proposal without discussing it with her first. Proposals are big steps, and maybe not talking about it beforehand led to confusion. The girlfriend said they were moving too quickly, which is a common reason people might feel pressured. She might not have been ready and then felt trapped after saying yes in front of others.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was hurt because she changed her mind. Ending the relationship because of that seems drastic. Maybe the author should have communicated better about his intentions and checked if she was ready. The girlfriend's reaction could be a sign that she wasn't prepared for marriage, not that she's insensitively leading him on. The author's proposal might have been a surprise, which could have added to her stress. \n\nBut wait, the girlfriend's response is also important. If she agreed to the proposal at the time, maybe she felt pressured in the moment and later realized she wasn't ready. The author's hurt feelings are valid, but ending the relationship immediately might not give room for discussion. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he didn't check in with her about their relationship status before proposing publicly, that could be a mistake. Public proposals can be exciting but might pressure the other person. The girlfriend's refusal to listen and the author's immediate breakup decision complicates things. \n\nSo, the author might be at fault for not discussing the proposal plan with her first. The girlfriend's change of heart is a reflection of her not being ready, but the author's approach could have been more thoughtful. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A). But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the girlfriend is also at fault. But the question is about the author's actions. If he didn't communicate his intentions and then reacted too harshly, then he's partially wrong. But the options are A or B. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. So I should go with A.\n"
