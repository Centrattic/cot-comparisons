We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a proposal that went sideways. The guy planned a public proposal on a cruise, the girl said yes initially but then changed her mind later that night. He's upset and ended the relationship because he felt led on, while she blames him for moving too fast and not discussing the engagement first.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The man's perspective: he set up a big proposal without discussing it first with her. He was excited, but when she changed her mind, he felt betrayed. He ended the relationship because he couldn't forgive her for leading him on. The woman's side: she agreed to the proposal publicly but later realized she wasn't ready. She felt pressured by the public proposal and thought they were moving too fast. She didn't communicate her feelings beforehand.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author (the man) is in the wrong. I need to evaluate that. Was the man wrong to propose without discussing it first? Public proposals can be stressful for some people. If he didn't talk to her about his intentions, maybe that was a mistake. Engagements are big decisions, so communication is key. By not having that conversation first, he might have assumed she was ready when she wasn't. \n\nOn the other hand, the woman changed her mind after agreeing. That can be hurtful too. Even if she felt pressured, retracting her \"yes\" so quickly could be seen as emotionally damaging. But maybe she had valid reasons. She mentioned not being ready, which is a personal choice. \n\nThe man ended the relationship because of her insensitivity. Is that fair? He might be right in feeling that she didn't handle the situation with care, but maybe he also contributed by not having the conversation first. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might share some blame. However, the question is specifically about the author (the man) being in the wrong. The key point is whether he was wrong to not discuss the proposal first. Since engagement is a mutual decision and a public proposal without prior discussion could be seen as presumptuous, he might be at fault. The woman's change of heart was hurtful, but the initial lack of communication from his side is a significant issue. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't have the necessary conversation with her before proposing, which led to her feeling pressured and the situation escalating. However, the woman's response also wasn't without fault. But since the question focuses on the author's wrongdoing, the answer leans towards A.\n"
