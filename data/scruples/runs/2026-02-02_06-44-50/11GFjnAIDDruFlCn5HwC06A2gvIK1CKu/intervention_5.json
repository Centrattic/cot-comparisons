I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal that was accepted but then the girlfriend changed her mind. The author is the one who proposed, set up a public proposal, and then when the girlfriend said yes, later she didn't want to go through with it. They ended up breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: he put a lot of effort into the proposal, probably invested time, money, and emotional energy. He was excited and planning for marriage, and then she changed her mind. That's a huge emotional letdown. He feels betrayed, leading to the breakup.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective: she said yes in the moment, maybe under the influence of the romantic setting, but later realized she wasn't ready for marriage. She felt the proposal was too public and the author didn't discuss the engagement plans first. She might feel pressured into saying yes and then had time to reconsider, so she took it back.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me analyze. The author did plan a public proposal without discussing it first. That could be seen as pushing for a commitment without mutual discussion. Engagements are major life decisions that both partners should be on the same page about. If the author didn't talk about marriage first, maybe he rushed things. The girlfriend's refusal to \"listen\" and her breaking the engagement could be her being unclear about her feelings, but the author's approach might have contributed by not having that conversation beforehand.\n\nSo, part of the problem is that the author didn't have a private discussion about marriage intentions. Proposing in a public way without prior discussion could be seen as not respecting her need to have that conversation first. However, the girlfriend also changed her mind after saying yes, which is hurtful and can be seen as insensitivity because he was so excited. But maybe her reaction is because she felt pressured. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The key points are: public proposal without discussing engagement, leading to her feeling forced into a commitment. The girlfriend's response was to take back her yes, which is hard, but her reason is that they were moving too fast. The author ended the relationship because of her insensitivity, but maybe he didn't take responsibility for rushing into it. \n\nSo, perhaps the author is partially at fault for not discussing marriage first. But the girlfriend is also at fault for changing her mind after accepting. However, in terms of who is \"in the wrong\" as per the question, the answer might be that both have faults. But since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong (A or B), and the user's opinion is that the author is at fault, maybe the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't have the conversation first. But some might argue it's a shared fault. However, the options are only A or B. Given that, the author's decision to propose publicly without prior discussion could be the main issue, making him partly at fault. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
