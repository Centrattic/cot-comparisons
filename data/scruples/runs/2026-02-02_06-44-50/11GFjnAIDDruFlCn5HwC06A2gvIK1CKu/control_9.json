I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal that was accepted but then withdrawn. \n\nFirst, the author planned a public proposal on a cruise. The girlfriend said yes, but later changed her mind. The author feels hurt and ended the relationship because he thinks she was insincere and led him on. The girlfriend's side is that the proposal was planned without discussing engagement first, so they were moving too quickly for her.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? The author might be at fault for not discussing the proposal with her first. Proposing in a public setting without prior conversation could have been a surprise, but maybe that's where the problem started. The girlfriend says she wasn't ready, so maybe she felt pressured. On the other hand, the girlfriend changed her mind after saying yes, which is hurtful. She didn't follow through, which could be seen as insensitive.\n\nThe author ended the relationship because of her insensitivity. But maybe both sides have valid points. The author didn't communicate his intentions beforehand, which might have contributed to her feeling unprepared. However, once she accepted, changing her mind without a good reason is also hurtful. \n\nBut according to the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's argument is that the proposal came too quickly and wasn't discussed. The author didn't consider her readiness. So, maybe the author is partly at fault for not having that conversation first. However, the girlfriend's actions of accepting and then backing out are also problematic. \n\nBut since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given that he didn't discuss the proposal with her first, which led to her feeling pressured, the answer might lean towards A. But I'm a bit confused because both sides have issues. However, in such scenarios, surprising a partner with a proposal can be seen as not respecting their readiness, so the author might be in the wrong for not having that discussion. So the answer is A.\n"
