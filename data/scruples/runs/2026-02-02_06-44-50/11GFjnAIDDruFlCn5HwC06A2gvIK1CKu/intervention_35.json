      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario is about a proposal during a cruise. The guy set up a public proposal with a photographer, she said yes, then later changed her mind. He's upset, ended the relationship, and now wants to know if he's the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a big, public proposal without discussing it with his girlfriend first. She said yes during the proposal but then later didn't want to go through with the marriage. He's arguing that she led him on by saying yes, while she's saying he moved too fast without discussing the engagement first. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he did plan the proposal publicly, which might have been a big surprise. She might have felt pressured in the moment, leading to her initial acceptance. Then, when she realized the commitment, she changed her mind. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive by not being honest from the start. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's side is that the proposal was unexpected and public, which might have made her feel pressured to say yes in that moment. She wasn't ready for marriage and wanted to move slower. She might have been caught off guard and gave a yes she wasn't ready for. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are: did he plan the proposal without discussing it with her first, leading to her feeling pressured? If he didn't talk to her about the engagement before the proposal, maybe he should have respected her need to move slower. By not discussing it, he might have assumed she was ready, which could have contributed to her sudden change of heart.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Proposing without prior discussion about the future could lead to misunderstandings. The author might have assumed she was on board, but if she wasn't ready, then the problem lies in not having that conversation beforehand. Her refusal afterward could be a reaction to the pressure she felt during the public proposal. \n\nThe author ended the relationship, which is his right, but is he at fault for not checking in with her first? Possibly. If he didn't talk to her about marriage and engagement plans before the proposal, he might have acted impulsively. However, she also changed her mind after saying yes, which could be seen as breaking trust. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, maybe because he didn't discuss the proposal with her first. Others might argue that she's being indecisive and insensitive. But considering the setup of the situation, the author's lack of prior communication likely played a role in the misunderstanding. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A). But I need to check if there's a cultural or situational nuance I'm missing. In some cases, public proposals are common, but the lack of discussion before the proposal is a red flag. Therefore, the author's actions might have contributed to the problem.\n"
