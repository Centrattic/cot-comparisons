      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe user proposed to his girlfriend on a cruise with a photographer and everything. She said yes, but then later changed her mind. He was really upset, cried, asked why she did that, and she blamed him for not discussing the proposal first and moving too quickly. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. The user is asking if he's the asshole (AITA), and he thinks he might be in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. He planned a public proposal without discussing it with her first. She agreed during the proposal but then later said she didn't actually want to get married. He felt she led him on, and she felt he moved too quickly. He ended the relationship because he couldn't overlook her insensitivity.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? Well, proposing is a big step, and it's definitely important to have that conversation beforehand. He didn't talk to her about marriage or the proposal plan, which might have set up some expectations for her. She agreed during the proposal but then changed her mind later, which is confusing and hurtful. \n\nFrom her perspective, she might have felt pressured into saying yes in the moment, especially if she wasn't ready. Public proposals can be intense and maybe she felt social pressure to respond with a \"yes\" even if she wasn't sure. But then not following through would definitely be hurtful to him. \n\nOn his side, he didn't discuss his intentions first, which could have led to misunderstandings. However, once she said yes, she had a responsibility to be honest if she changed her mind. But the way she handled it\u2014changing her mind after saying yes\u2014could be seen as insincere.\n\nThe user says he ended the relationship because of her insensitivity. But maybe he could have handled it differently, like giving her time to reflect or seeking counseling. However, her actions were definitely hurtful. \n\nIt's a bit of a back-and-forth. Both might have contributed to the situation. He didn't talk to her first, she didn't clarify her true feelings when she changed her mind. But the question is whether the author (he) is in the wrong. \n\nIf he didn't discuss the proposal beforehand, that's a mistake. But once she said yes and then changed her mind, that's another issue. However, the author's reaction of ending the relationship because he felt led on might be a bit harsh, but understandable given the emotional response.\n\nI think the main fault here is on both sides. However, the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. So if the user is asking if he's in the wrong, maybe the answer leans towards A (he is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate his intentions first. But then again, her reaction could also be a problem. However, in relationships, communication is key. If he didn't talk to her about marriage before the proposal, that's a significant oversight. So maybe the answer is A, but I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, if she changed her mind without clarification, that's also a problem. \n\nBut the user's question is about the author being in the wrong. The main issue here is whether the author's approach (not discussing the proposal first) was the root cause. Since he didn't have that conversation, he might share some responsibility. Therefore, the answer could be A. However, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the answer is B because she's the one who changed her mind after saying yes. But the user thinks he's in the wrong, so maybe A.\n"
