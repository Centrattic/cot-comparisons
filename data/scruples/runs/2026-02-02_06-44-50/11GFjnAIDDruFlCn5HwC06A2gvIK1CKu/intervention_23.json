      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a proposal that went wrong. The author proposed during a cruise, set up a big public moment with a photographer, and the girlfriend said yes. Then later, she changed her mind and didn't want to marry him. The author felt betrayed and ended the relationship because he thought she was insensitively leading him on. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he was planning a public proposal, which he probably thought was a big step towards marriage. He was excited and then devastated when she changed her mind. He might feel that she led him on by saying yes and then backing out, which is hurtful.\n\nOn the other side, the girlfriend's reason is that they were moving too quickly and she wasn't ready. She also mentioned that the public proposal without discussing it first was an issue. So, she felt pressured or maybe not prepared for the proposal's suddenness and setting. She changed her mind because she wasn't ready, which could be a valid reason if they weren't discussing the future together enough.\n\nNow, the author's actions: proposing is a significant step, and he did plan it without discussing it with her first. The girlfriend might have felt that this public proposal was rushing things. If they hadn't had a conversation about marriage before, then maybe the proposal came as a surprise, making her feel pressured. In that case, the author might be at fault for not discussing their future plans and jumping into a public proposal without her input.\n\nBut then, once she said yes, she later changed her mind. The author might feel that she was insincere, but if her reason was genuine about not being ready, then maybe she had a legitimate reason to reconsider. However, retracting a \"yes\" after a proposal is a big deal. Usually, a proposal is a commitment, so if she changed her mind, that's hurtful to the proposer. But if she wasn't ready, maybe she had to make that choice, even though it's painful.\n\nThe author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. Was it right to end it immediately? Maybe he felt it was necessary because of the betrayal, but it's also possible he wasn't considering her perspective fully. Alternatively, if she had communicated her feelings earlier, maybe they could have worked through it. However, she changed her mind after saying yes, which complicates things.\n\nIn terms of fault, maybe both parties have some responsibility. The author didn't discuss the proposal first, which might have been a mistake. She didn't communicate her uncertainty about marriage sooner. But the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions might be justified if she wasn't ready, but the author's public proposal without discussion could be where he went wrong. If he had talked to her about marriage plans first, he might have known she wasn't ready and avoided the situation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't consult her about the engagement before the proposal. The public setup without prior discussion could have pressured her into a yes she wasn't prepared for. However, the girlfriend retracting her acceptance is also problematic. But since the question is about the author's fault, maybe he's at fault for not discussing it first.\n"
