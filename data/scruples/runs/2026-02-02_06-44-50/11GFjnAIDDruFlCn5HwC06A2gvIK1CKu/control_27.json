      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault in this situation. The scenario is that the guy proposed on a cruise, got a yes, but then the girl took it back. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitively leading him on.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The guy planned a big proposal without discussing it with her first. Maybe that was a problem. Proposing is a huge step, and not talking about it beforehand could make her feel surprised or pressured. She said they were moving too quickly. So maybe he didn't read the relationship's readiness correctly.\n\nShe said yes initially but then changed her mind. That's confusing. But when he got emotional and asked why she did that, she blamed him for the public proposal. She might be reacting to feeling caught off guard. But then she didn't want to marry him, so she could have been clearer. However, the way she handled it might have been hurtful, but does that make her wrong?\n\nThe guy ended the relationship because he couldn't overlook her insensitivity. He feels betrayed. But maybe he should have considered that she was scared or unsure. Proposals are a big deal, and sometimes people say yes in the moment but then realize they're not ready. It's possible neither is entirely wrong. But the user wants to know if the author (the guy) is in the wrong.\n\nHe didn't discuss the engagement plans with her first, which could be a mistake. Proposing without discussing whether she's ready for marriage might be a misstep. However, she did say yes and then took it back, which is her choice. But breaking up because she changed her mind might be his fault for not handling it differently. Alternatively, he might be justified in feeling hurt and ending things if he can't accept the uncertainty.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might have contributed. But the question is about the author's wrongdoing. If he forced the proposal without checking in, maybe he's partly at fault. However, she changed her mind after accepting, which is her decision. The answer depends on whether not discussing the proposal was a major fault. Some might say he should have talked about marriage plans before proposing, making him partly responsible. Others might say she should have clarified her feelings before leading him on. But the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't consult her first, that's a point against him. But she took back her yes, which complicates things. The answer might be B (No), because while he could have discussed it more, she changed her mind, so he's not entirely wrong. But the fact that he ended it because of her insensitivity might be his own issue. Hmm. I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he proposed, got a yes, and she changed her mind. But his approach might have been flawed. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about whether both have flaws. Since she retracted her acceptance, which is a big deal, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship.\n"
