I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the person proposed on a cruise, set up a big scene with a photographer, and the girlfriend said yes but then changed her mind. The author ended the relationship because he felt she led him on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's actions: he went through a lot to plan a public proposal, which is a big commitment. He was excited and trusting when she said yes. Then she changed her mind, which caused him emotional pain. He ended the relationship because he couldn't forgive her for not being honest.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex-girlfriend's perspective: she agreed to the proposal but later realized she wasn't ready. She blamed the author for moving too quickly by planning a public proposal without discussing the engagement first. She might not have felt comfortable to express her hesitation earlier because of the pressure from the proposal setup.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key points are whether the author's actions were at fault. Did he act inconsiderately by planning a public proposal without discussing it first? Proposing is a major step, and doing it publicly might pressure the other person. However, if the ex said yes and then changed her mind, that's a betrayal of trust. The author's response was to end the relationship, which is a personal choice but might be seen as justified given the broken trust.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for not discussing engagement plans before the proposal? Maybe. Public proposals can be exciting, but they should involve mutual agreement. If the author didn't have that conversation, he might share some responsibility for not checking in with her readiness. However, the ex's actions after saying yes are also problematic\u2014breaking the engagement is a significant decision that she didn't honor until after the proposal.\n\nIn terms of accountability, both parties might have contributed. The author didn't discuss the engagement plans beforehand, which could have led to the ex feeling unprepared. But her going back on her word after a proposal is also a major issue. The author ending the relationship due to her insensitivity might be a reaction to her breaking his trust, which is understandable.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If he didn't consult her about the engagement before the proposal, that's a mistake. But her changing her mind after saying yes is also wrong. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the ex's actions were a direct betrayal after he trusted her, the author's decision to end it might not be his fault. But if he didn't communicate his intentions beforehand, that's a flaw. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because while both made mistakes, the main fault lies with the ex for changing her mind after the commitment. The author's public proposal might not be the sole issue if they had discussed engagement plans. But without that discussion, he might share some blame. However, the key issue is her breaking the promise, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
