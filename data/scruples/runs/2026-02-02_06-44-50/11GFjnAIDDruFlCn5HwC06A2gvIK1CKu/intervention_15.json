I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author proposed on a cruise, set up a public proposal with a photographer. The girlfriend said yes, but later changed her mind. The author felt broken, cried, and ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. She claimed it was his fault for not discussing the engagement first and moving too quickly.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. Let me break it down. \n\nFirst, the proposal was public. Maybe that's a big step without discussing it first. The girlfriend said yes but then changed her mind. The author is upset because she led him on. But she's saying that the problem was his for not talking about engagement before. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he didn't discuss the commitment of marriage beforehand, maybe he should have known her feelings better. Proposing without discussing the engagement could be moving too fast, which she's pointing out. But then, she said yes in front of people, which adds pressure and can be hurtful if she changes her mind later.\n\nBut from the author's perspective, he was expecting her to follow through after saying yes, and she didn't, which felt like betrayal. However, maybe he was inconsiderate by not checking in with her about marriage plans before proposing publicly. \n\nSo, is he wrong? If he didn't communicate his intentions and the commitment involved, maybe he's at fault. But if she accepted the proposal and then changed her mind, that's also a problem. But the key here is that he ended the relationship because of her insensitivity, while she was also being honest about her feelings. \n\nIt's a bit of a 50/50 situation. But in terms of who is in the wrong, perhaps the author is partly wrong for not discussing engagement first. However, her changing her mind after accepting is also hurtful. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. So, considering the setup of a public proposal without prior discussion, I think the author may be in the wrong for not being more considerate of her feelings and readiness. So answer A.\n"
