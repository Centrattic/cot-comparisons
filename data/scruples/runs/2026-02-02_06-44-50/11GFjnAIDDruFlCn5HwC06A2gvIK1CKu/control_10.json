      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy proposed during a cruise, set up a big public proposal with a photographer, and the girl said yes. Then later, she changed her mind. He's upset, they broke up, and now he's asking if he's the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy planned a surprise proposal, which is a big step. But maybe he didn't talk to her about marriage before doing it. The girl said it was his fault for moving too quickly and not discussing engagement first. She didn't want to marry him, which led to the breakup.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the guy make a mistake by not discussing the engagement before proposing? And was the girl's reaction reasonable? Proposing without prior discussion could be seen as rushing things, which might explain why she felt pressured. On the other hand, she did say yes publicly before changing her mind, which could be seen as leading him on.\n\nBut in relationships, communication is key. If he didn't talk to her about marriage, maybe he expected her to know his intentions, which isn't fair. However, after she said yes, her changing her mind is also a problem. But he ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive for not telling him earlier. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The guy's actions might have been impulsive, but the girl's change of heart after a yes is also hurtful. However, the question is whether the author (the guy) is in the wrong. If the girl felt pressured into saying yes initially and then realized she wasn't ready, but the guy didn't communicate properly before proposing, the responsibility could be shared. But since he ended the relationship due to her insensitivity, maybe he's justified. \n\nAlternatively, if he didn't discuss the proposal first, he might have been at fault for not ensuring her readiness. But the fact that she said yes and then changed her mind complicates things. I think the main issue is the lack of communication before the proposal. So maybe the author is partially at fault, but it's not entirely his mistake. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no). Considering that he didn't discuss it, leading her to say yes and then change her mind, he might share some blame. But the girl's actions after saying yes are also problematic. It's a tough call, but perhaps the answer is B because the girl's change of heart is more insensitivity, but the initial proposal without discussion is his fault. Hmm.\n"
