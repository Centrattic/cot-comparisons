I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves a proposal that was accepted but later retracted. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author planned a public proposal without discussing it first. The girlfriend said yes but then changed her mind, leading to a breakup. The author feels betrayed and ended things because of her insensitivity.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. Proposing is a significant step, and not discussing it beforehand could be seen as a lack of communication. The girlfriend might feel pressured if the proposal was sudden and public. On the other hand, once a proposal is accepted, especially publicly, there's an expectation of commitment. Retracting the acceptance might be seen as breaking trust.\n\nThe author's argument is that the girlfriend led him on. The girlfriend argues that the proposal was rushed. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not discussing the proposal first. In relationships, big decisions should ideally be mutual. Public proposals can be romantic, but they might not give the proposer enough time to process the decision, leading to pressure.\n\nHowever, once a proposal is accepted, retracting it is problematic. The girlfriend's change of heart after saying yes is a major issue. The author's reaction is understandable as it's a significant emotional letdown. But the initial lack of discussion does play a role here. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The author didn't discuss the proposal plans, which might have contributed to the girlfriend's hesitation. However, retracting a \"yes\" is a big deal. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because the girlfriend's actions were insensitivity, but there's also a part where the author could have handled the proposal differently. But the main blame here is on the girlfriend for changing her mind after accepting. So the answer is B.\n"
