      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves a proposal during a cruise where the girlfriend accepted but then changed her mind, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, the author planned a public proposal without discussing it with his partner first. The girlfriend said \"yes\" during the proposal but later clarified she wasn't ready. The key here is whether the author made a mistake by not discussing the engagement plans beforehand. Public proposals can be a big surprise, which might not always be the best approach. The girlfriend felt that they were moving too quickly and that the public nature of the proposal pressured her. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument is that the proposal wasn't discussed, leading her to feel led on. On the other hand, the author feels betrayed because she changed her mind after accepting. The question is about fault. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. If the author didn't talk to her about proposing, he might have assumed she was ready, which could be a misstep. However, the girlfriend's change of heart after a yes could also be seen as insensitivity. But according to the story, she said she wasn't ready, so maybe the author's approach was too abrupt. \n\nThe author ended the relationship due to her insensitivity, but maybe he also contributed by not discussing the proposal. So, is he in the wrong? Possibly, because he didn't check in with her before the proposal. However, her reaction after accepting might also be at fault. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Considering that he didn't have a conversation about engagement first, which is a major step, he might share some responsibility. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate his intentions beforehand, leading to misunderstanding.\n"
