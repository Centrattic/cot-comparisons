I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault in the situation described. The scenario involves a proposal that was accepted but then rescinded. The key points here are the setup of the proposal, the immediate reaction, and the communication issues.\n\nFirst, the author planned a public proposal without discussing it with the girlfriend first. The ex-girlfriend felt that the proposal was too sudden and that they were moving too quickly. She changed her mind after initially saying yes. The author feels hurt and wronged, ending the relationship because he believes she was insensitive.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms, proposing without prior discussion can be seen as inconsiderate. Traditionally, engagements are discussed between partners before the proposal happens. By not having that conversation, the author may have assumed his partner was ready for that step, which she wasn't. This lack of communication on his part could contribute to the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex-girlfriend changed her mind after the proposal. While she might have her reasons, retracting a \"yes\" to marriage is a significant decision and could be seen as insensitivity as well. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe author's actions led to a public proposal without prior discussion. That's a key point. Even if the ex-girlfriend changed her mind, the setup might have pressured her or made it hard for her to refuse in the moment. The public nature could have made her feel cornered, leading to her initial acceptance but then her change of heart. So, the author might bear some responsibility for not checking in with her first.\n\nBut then, the ex-girlfriend's refusal after accepting could also be seen as her not being honest about her feelings. The author ended the relationship due to her insensitivity, but maybe he could have handled the situation differently. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The initial decision to propose without discussing it might be the crux here. \n\nIn many relationships, big decisions like proposals are mutual. By not discussing, the author might have overlooked her readiness. So, answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) might be the case because he didn't communicate his intentions beforehand. However, there's also the aspect of her retracting her acceptance, which is also problematic. But the question is about the author's fault. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A because the author didn't discuss the proposal with her first, which led to the misunderstanding. His action of planning a surprise proposal without mutual discussion could be seen as the root cause of the conflict. Therefore, he's at least partially at fault.\n"
