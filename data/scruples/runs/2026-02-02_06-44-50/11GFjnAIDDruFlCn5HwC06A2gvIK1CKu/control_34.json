      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a proposal that was accepted but then withdrawn. The author proposed in a public, planned way, and the girlfriend said yes but later changed her mind. He ended the relationship because she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The proposer set up a public proposal, which might be seen as a big commitment without prior discussion. The girlfriend said yes but wasn't ready, leading to a breakup. The proposer feels betrayed and ended it because he couldn't overlook her insensitivity. The girlfriend claims the problem was rushing into engagement without discussing it first.\n\nSo, the proposer's mistake might be not discussing the proposal with her beforehand. Public proposals can be surprising, but a major decision like marriage should ideally be discussed. The girlfriend's response of saying yes and then backing out could be seen as leading him on, which is hurtful. However, the root issue might be communication. If the proposer didn't check in with her about their readiness for marriage, he might share some responsibility. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend changing her mind after saying yes is definitely hurtful and insensitivity here is on her part. The proposer had a right to feel devastated. But if they didn't have the conversation about marriage before the proposal, the proposer might be at fault for not ensuring both were on the same page. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the proposer's lack of prior discussion makes him wrong. If the key issue is that he didn't talk about the engagement before the proposal, then he's in the wrong. But if the main issue is her backing out, then maybe not. However, in relationships, major decisions like marriage should be mutual and discussed. So the proposer's approach might have been flawed by not having that conversation. Therefore, the answer could be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't discuss the proposal plan with her, leading to her confusion or not being ready. Alternatively, if the focus is on her insensitivity after the proposal, maybe B. But given the girlfriend's argument about moving too quickly, the proposer's lack of communication is a key point. Hence, A might be the right choice.\n"
