I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when their ex-girlfriend changed her mind after he proposed. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author planned a big, public proposal during a cruise, complete with a photographer. She said yes, they celebrated, but then later she changed her mind. The author felt hurt and ended the relationship, thinking she was insincere. She, on the other hand, blamed him for moving too fast without discussing the engagement first.\n\nSo, the main points here are the public proposal without prior discussion and her changing her answer. The author is upset because he was led to believe she was okay with marriage, but she wasn't. She says it was his fault for not talking about it first.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author's action of proposing publicly might have been a surprise, but maybe he should have had that conversation beforehand. Proposals are significant, and assuming the other person is ready without discussing it could lead to misunderstandings. On the other hand, she initially said yes, then changed her mind. That's a big shift, but maybe her hesitation was valid if they hadn't talked about the future.\n\nThe key issue here is communication. The author didn't discuss the proposal with her, jumping into a public commitment without knowing her feelings. She might have felt pressured, hence her change of heart. However, after she said yes, retracting it is also problematic. But in the moment, maybe she realized she wasn't ready.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not having that conversation first. Proposing publicly without checking in with her about their future could be seen as impulsive. But she also took back her acceptance, which is a big deal. However, her reasoning about moving too fast is part of the problem. The author is upset because he felt manipulated, but perhaps he shares some responsibility for not ensuring they were on the same page before proposing.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might have some faults. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't discuss the proposal with her and assumed she was ready, that's a misstep. However, her retracting the yes after saying it is also a problem. But in many cases, the person who proposes is expected to have that conversation first. So maybe the author is at least partially in the wrong. But the user thinks he's in the wrong, and I need to decide between A or B.\n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't communicate his intentions beforehand, leading to her change of heart. However, she also retracting her acceptance complicates things. But the main fault here is his lack of communication before proposing.\n"
