I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a proposal that went wrong.\n\nFirst, the author planned a public proposal during a cruise. The girlfriend said yes, but later changed her mind, leading to the breakup. The author argues that she led him on, while she claimed it was his fault for not discussing engagement first and moving too quickly.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author's reasoning: he followed through with a proposal, which is a big commitment. She initially accepted but then changed her mind, which he found insensitive. He ended the relationship because of this.\n\nHer reasoning: she felt he moved too fast by not discussing the engagement beforehand. She might have felt pressured, especially if the proposal was public and planned without prior discussion. She could have felt uncomfortable declining in front of others or didn't want to hurt his feelings immediately.\n\nPossible issues: Proposing without discussing engagement could be seen as moving too quickly. Public proposals can be stressful for the person being asked, as they might feel pressured to accept on the spot. The author might have assumed her \"yes\" was genuine, but she later realized she wasn't ready, which can happen even after a yes.\n\nBut does that make him in the wrong? He didn't force her; she initially said yes. However, not discussing the engagement beforehand could be a misstep. On the other hand, she changed her mind after accepting, which is hard on him. Both sides have some responsibility here. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but maybe the answer isn't clear-cut. However, in terms of responsibility, if he didn't discuss it first, that's a factor. Yet, her changing her mind isn't his fault. So perhaps he's not entirely wrong, but there's room for both sides. The key is whether his actions were the primary cause. Since the proposal was a big step without prior discussion, maybe he did move too fast, but that doesn't make her change of heart right. The answer might be B (No), because while there are issues, he's not entirely in the wrong. Alternatively, A if his actions were the main problem. But given the way the question is framed, maybe he's not in the wrong. Hmm.\n"
