I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong after his girlfriend took back her \"yes\" during a proposal on a cruise. The author proposed publicly with a photographer and champagne, and she initially said yes, but then changed her mind later that night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author felt excited and then hurt when the engagement was rejected. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive for leading him on. The girlfriend, on the other hand, claims that the public proposal without discussing the engagement first was the problem. She said they were moving too quickly and she wasn't ready. She didn't want to marry him, even though she said yes initially.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both perspectives. Public proposals can be a big deal, and maybe the author didn't consider her readiness. However, once she said yes, retracting it later could be seen as insincere. But the girlfriend's reason is that they moved too fast, so maybe she wasn't sure. The author ended the relationship because of her insensitivity, but perhaps he could have handled it differently instead of ending it immediately.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might have contributed by not discussing the proposal privately first. However, once she said yes, retracting it could have been handled more sensitively. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions led to the breakup, but the author's decision to end the relationship based on her changing her mind might be seen as his choice, not necessarily his fault.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might not be in the wrong. He acted on his feelings of being hurt and not respected. The girlfriend had the right to change her mind, but that doesn't make the author wrong for ending the relationship. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
