I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal that got rejected after an initial yes. The proposer set up a public proposal with a photographer, and the girlfriend said yes but later changed her mind. The proposer feels hurt and ended the relationship, thinking she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The proposer probably wanted to make the moment special and exciting. Public proposals can be a big deal, and maybe he didn't realize she wasn't ready. On the other hand, the girlfriend changed her mind after saying yes, which is confusing. She mentioned they were moving too fast and that the public proposal was the problem. \n\nIs the proposer at fault for not discussing engagement plans first? Maybe. Proposing is a big step, and discussing expectations beforehand could prevent misunderstandings. But she did say yes initially, then changed her mind. That seems like her issue. She might not have been honest about her readiness. \n\nThe proposer ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitively leading him on. Is that fair? If she changed her mind after commitment, that's her responsibility. But if he didn't check in with her before the proposal, maybe he shares some blame. However, the main question is whether he's in the wrong. Since she changed her mind after accepting, the primary fault might lie with her. The proposer's reaction is understandable given the context. So the answer might be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
