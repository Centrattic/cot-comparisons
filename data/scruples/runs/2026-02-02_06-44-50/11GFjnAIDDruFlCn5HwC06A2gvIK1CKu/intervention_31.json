      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author proposed during a cruise, and his then-girlfriend said yes, but later changed her mind. He's upset and ended the relationship because she led him on, and she's blaming him for moving too quickly without discussing engagement first.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to analyze both sides. The author planned a public proposal without discussing it with her first. That might be an issue because engagement is a big decision that should involve both people. If he didn't talk about it beforehand, maybe he did rush things. On the other hand, she said yes publicly and then changed her mind. That's also a problem because after accepting the proposal, it's expected that she would follow through. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I should check the reasoning. The author might have made a mistake by not discussing the proposal first, but once she said yes, backing out could be hurtful. However, she might have had valid reasons for not being ready. The question is about whether the author is at fault. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might share some blame. The author didn't check in with her about their future, but after accepting the proposal, she didn't follow through. But the key here is that after she said yes, changing her mind could be seen as insensitivity. Alternatively, maybe she was honest about not being ready. \n\nThe user's answer is A (author is in the wrong), but I need to evaluate. If the author didn't discuss the proposal first, that's a problem. But once she said yes, her backing out is also an issue. However, the question is about the author's fault. So maybe the main issue is that he proposed without discussing it, leading her to agree in the moment but then realizing she wasn't ready. So perhaps he is at fault for not checking in with her first. \n\nAlternatively, she could be blamed for changing her mind after accepting. But the user's initial thought is that the author is wrong. I think both have some fault, but the question is specifically about the author. If the author's mistake was not discussing engagement first, then he's partly responsible. But the act of proposing publicly without prior discussion could be seen as moving too quickly. So maybe the answer is A. But some might argue that she's wrong for going back on her yes. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that he didn't talk about it first, that's a key point. So answer A.\n"
