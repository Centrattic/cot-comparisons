      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal that got rejected after being accepted. The guy planned a big proposal on a cruise, and she said yes, but then changed her mind later. He's upset and ended the relationship, thinking she's insensitive. The question is whether he (the author) is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The key points are the public proposal without prior discussion, her changing her mind, and the breakup. The author is asking if he's the one at fault.\n\nThe person who wrote this is the one who proposed without discussing it with his partner first. She felt that he was moving too quickly and didn't want to get married, but she said \"yes\" during the proposal and then later changed her mind. He's arguing that she should have been honest, but she says the problem was that he didn't talk to her about the engagement first.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for proposing without discussing it with her first. Marriage is a big step, and it's important both partners are on the same page. If he went ahead with a public proposal without checking in with her first, maybe that's a mistake. However, she did say yes during the proposal, so she might have been in the wrong for leading him on. But then she changed her mind afterwards, which is confusing.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the responsibility lies more with the proposer for not discussing it first or with the other person for changing her mind after saying yes. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he wanted to get married, he should have had that conversation before the proposal. Proposing in a public way without prior discussion might have been too sudden for her. However, once she said yes, changing her mind later could be hurtful. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author (the proposer) is in the wrong. Since he didn't discuss the engagement with her first, that's a valid point. He might have assumed she was ready, but she wasn't. So, he's at least partially responsible for not checking in with her. However, her reaction and changing her mind after accepting could also be a problem.\n\nThe answer here hinges on the premise that proposing without discussing it first is a mistake. If that's the case, then the author is in the wrong (option A). But if the main issue is her changing her mind, then maybe not (option B). But given that the woman did say yes and then changed her mind, that's a problem on her end. However, the initial proposal without discussion is the author's fault. So maybe the answer is A. But I need to check if the main fault is on the author's side.\n\nIn many relationship advice contexts, proposing without discussing the engagement first is considered a mistake. It's important for both partners to be on the same page. So, the author's decision to make a public proposal without prior discussion could be seen as the main issue here. Hence, the answer would be A.\n"
