      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he proposed during a cruise with a setup, she said yes but later changed her mind. He's upset and ended the relationship because he feels she led him on without discussing the engagement first. She says the fault is his for moving too fast and not talking about marriage before the public proposal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author did plan a public proposal without discussing it beforehand. That could be a problem because a proposal is a big step, and doing it without prior discussion might have been a miscalculation. She might have felt pressured or caught off guard. On the other hand, once she said yes, he was excited, and then she changed her mind, which is hurtful. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he didn't talk to her about marriage before the proposal, which is a key factor. Proposals are typically discussed beforehand, even if they're a surprise. By not having that conversation, he might have made an assumption she wasn't ready for. However, after she accepted, her backing out was also inconsiderate. The question is whether the fault lies more with him for not checking in first or her for changing her mind.\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. If he had discussed marriage plans with her before the proposal, maybe they could have aligned expectations. Public proposals can be exciting, but without prior conversation, it's risky. So, he might share some responsibility for not ensuring she was ready. However, her reaction and changing her mind after accepting is also hurtful. But the main point here is that he didn't consult with her first, which could be seen as the trigger for the conflict. So, the answer might lean towards him being at least partly in the wrong. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't discuss it beforehand, maybe the answer is A (Yes), but I need to check if the community typically sees this as a mistake. In AITA scenarios, not discussing a proposal is often a fault. So probably answer A.\n"
