      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy proposed on a cruise, she said yes, they celebrated, but then she changed her mind. The guy is upset, she says it's his fault for not discussing engagement first and moving too fast. He ends the relationship because he can't overlook her insensitivity.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author planned a public proposal without talking to her about marriage first. Maybe that's a key point. Proposing is a big step, and if he didn't have a conversation about their future together, maybe he made it seem like an expectation rather than a genuine proposal. She might have felt pressured if the proposal came out of the blue, even if she initially said yes. But then she changed her mind after they celebrated, which could be seen as breaking trust. However, maybe she realized she wasn't ready after the fact.\n\nThe guy is hurt because she led him on. He ended the relationship because he felt she wasn't honest. She, on the other hand, blames him for jumping into things without discussing it. So, who is right? \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he didn't talk to her about his intentions before proposing, maybe he's at fault for not giving her a chance to express her feelings. Engagements are major life steps, and both partners should be on the same page. If he assumed she was ready because she said yes in the moment, but she wasn't, then he might have been hasty. However, once she changed her mind after agreeing, that's also a problem because it breaks his trust.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to assess. If he didn't discuss engagement first, maybe he's wrong for not having that conversation. However, the act of proposing is a personal choice. Public proposals can be romantic, but if the other person isn't ready, it can cause issues. So maybe he's partly at fault for not ensuring she was ready. On the other hand, she later changed her mind, which isn't right either. \n\nBut the guy ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive for changing her mind and not being honest. Is that his right? If she didn't want to marry him, she should have been honest from the start. But she did say yes, then changed her mind. That's definitely hurtful. However, if he didn't check in with her before the proposal, he's also responsible. \n\nSo, in terms of the question: is the author in the wrong? The answer might be that he is partially at fault for not discussing engagement first, but she's also wrong for changing her mind. However, the question is specifically about the author. The answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't have that conversation. But some might argue that the proposal is his right, and she's the one who changed her mind. \n\nHmm. The user said they think the author is in the wrong. I need to decide based on the situation. The key point is the lack of prior discussion about engagement. If the author didn't talk to her about marriage before proposing, then he might have acted impulsively. So, AITA would be the author for not ensuring she was ready. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
