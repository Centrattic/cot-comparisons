I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author proposed during a cruise with a photographer, the girlfriend said yes, then later changed her mind. The author feels hurt and ended the relationship, thinking she was insensitive. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author planned a public proposal without discussing it with his partner first. The girlfriend said yes initially but later didn't want to go through with it. She argues that the public proposal was a problem because they weren't discussing the engagement seriously yet. The author is upset that she led him on, while she's upset about the sudden proposal.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Proposing without a prior discussion about marriage could be seen as rushing things. The girlfriend might have felt pressured, especially if they weren't ready for that step. Her changing her mind after saying yes might be because she realized the proposal caught her off guard. However, retracting a \"yes\" after a proposal is also problematic because it can be hurtful and confusing.\n\nThe author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. But maybe he should have considered why she changed her mind. She might have felt that the public proposal wasn't the right way to discuss such a big decision. If they hadn't talked about their future plans, jumping to marriage could have been premature.\n\nOn the other hand, once she said yes, even if it was in a public setting, retracting that commitment later would be emotionally damaging. The author's hurt feelings are valid. However, the root issue might be a lack of communication from both sides. The author didn't discuss his intentions beforehand, and she didn't clarify her feelings until after the proposal.\n\nSo, who is at fault? If the author proposed without discussing it, that's a problem. The girlfriend might have been unprepared for the proposal, leading her to say yes in the moment but change her mind later. But retracting the acceptance after the fact is also hurtful. It's a bit of a 50-50 situation. However, since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the main point is that the proposal was planned without discussion. That could be seen as the author's mistake, making him at least partially responsible. But the girlfriend's actions also contributed. Given that, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate his intentions, which led to the misunderstanding. But some might argue that both are at fault. However, based on the options given, the answer is either A or B. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess based on the situation. The key is that the author's public proposal without prior discussion is a misstep, so he's partially at fault, hence answer A.\n"
