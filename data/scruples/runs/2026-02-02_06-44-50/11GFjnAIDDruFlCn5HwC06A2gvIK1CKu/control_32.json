      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault in this situation where his girlfriend changed her mind after he proposed on a cruise. \n\nFirst, the author planned a public proposal with a photographer and everything. The girlfriend said yes initially but later changed her mind. The author felt led on and ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he followed through with a big commitment step (proposing) based on her initial \"yes,\" and when she took it back, he felt betrayed. The girlfriend, on the other hand, says he moved too fast without discussing the engagement first and wasn't ready. She might feel that the public proposal pressured her into a quick decision she wasn't prepared to make.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms, proposing is a significant step, and while it's a personal decision, the way the author handled it might have contributed to the problem. Proposing publicly without prior discussion about their readiness for marriage could be seen as moving too quickly, which the girlfriend pointed out. However, once she said yes, retracting it later would likely cause emotional distress. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual readiness. The author didn't discuss the engagement plans with her beforehand, which she found problematic. But once she said yes and then changed her mind, that's where the conflict arises. The author ended the relationship due to her changing her mind and perceived insensitivity, while she blamed him for moving too fast.\n\nIn terms of fault, both parties might have some responsibility. The author didn't check in with her about their future plans before proposing, and the girlfriend didn't clarify her feelings before accepting. However, the question is about the author being in the wrong. Since the girlfriend changed her mind after accepting, which is a major betrayal of trust, the author's reaction is understandable. But the initial proposal without discussion was his mistake. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of both, but if we have to choose between A and B, the answer would depend on whether the main fault is on the author for not discussing engagement first or the girlfriend for retracting her acceptance. Since the girlfriend's action (changing her mind after \"yes\") is more hurtful, the author's reaction is more about her insensitivity. However, the author's decision to propose without prior discussion did set up the situation. \n\nBut the question is about the author's wrongdoing. If the girlfriend took back her \"yes,\" that's her issue. The author's part is whether he was wrong for not discussing engagement first. The girlfriend's response that it was his fault for moving too quickly might make the author partially at fault. However, the main action in question is the girlfriend taking back her \"yes.\" The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, so if the answer is A (yes), then the author's mistake was not discussing engagement plans first. If it's B (no), then the main issue is the girlfriend's change of heart. \n\nGiven that the author is asking if he's in the wrong, and the girlfriend's actions are the central problem, but the author's approach contributed to the problem. However, the main wrong here is the girlfriend retracting the acceptance, so the author is not necessarily in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
