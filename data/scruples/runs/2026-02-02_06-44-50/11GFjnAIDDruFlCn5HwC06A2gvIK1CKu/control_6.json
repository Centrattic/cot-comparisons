      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a proposal that was accepted but then taken back by the girlfriend. The author feels hurt and ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The guy planned a public proposal without discussing it first. He set up a photographer and everything. She said yes, then changed her mind. She claims it was his fault because he didn't talk about engagement first and they were moving too fast. He thinks she should have told him earlier instead of leading him on.\n\nFrom a traditional perspective, proposing is a big step. Usually, couples discuss the future before such a commitment. If he didn't talk to her about marriage first, maybe he rushed things. She might have felt pressured during the proposal. But she did say yes and then backed out, which is very hurtful. She admitted she wasn't ready, which is her part to take responsibility for.\n\nHe ended the relationship because of her insensitivity. The question is whether he's wrong. On one hand, not discussing the proposal could be seen as his mistake. On the other hand, retracting a \"yes\" after the proposal is a big deal. Maybe both are at fault here. But the user wants a yes or no answer.\n\nThe options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). If the user is asking if he's in the wrong, even if he made a mistake by not talking about it first, she also made a mistake in changing her mind. However, the main issue here is her retraction. He ended the relationship because he felt led on. Is he in the wrong for ending it? Or is she in the wrong for retracting her acceptance?\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. He didn't discuss the proposal first, which is a problem. But her reaction and decision to change her mind after accepting is also problematic. However, since the question is about the author being in the wrong, maybe the fact that he didn't communicate his plans first makes him partially at fault. However, she's the one who changed her mind after accepting. So maybe he isn't entirely wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the main issue is her retracting the acceptance. If someone says yes and then takes it back, that's a huge betrayal. The author might not be in the wrong for ending the relationship because of her actions. So the answer could be B (not wrong).\n"
