      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA). The situation is that the author proposed during a cruise with a setup, she said yes, they celebrated, then later she changed her mind. The author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitively leading him on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a public proposal, which might have been a big surprise. He assumed she would say yes, but she wasn't ready. She claims the problem was moving too quickly and not discussing engagement first. The author feels hurt and betrayed, leading him to break up.\n\nFrom her perspective, she might have felt pressured by the public proposal without prior discussion. Maybe she wasn't prepared for marriage and felt caught off guard. It's possible she agreed in the moment due to the setup but wasn't truly committed. \n\nThe author's actions: Proposing publicly could be seen as not respecting her need for discussion. However, she did say yes initially. Now, she's changing her mind after celebrating. The author ended the relationship, which he justifies as her insensitivity. \n\nIs the author wrong for not discussing engagement beforehand? Proposals can be spontaneous, but a public one without prior talk might be over the top. However, she did accept. Her changing her mind after the fact is confusing. \n\nIs the author wrong for ending things? He felt hurt and couldn't overlook it. If she was insensitively leading him on, maybe he's justified. But maybe she had valid reasons for not being ready. \n\nIt's a tough call. Both sides have some responsibility. She didn't prepare him for her hesitation, but his approach might have been too sudden. The key is whether the author's actions were wrong. Since he ended the relationship over her change of heart, maybe he's not entirely wrong. But maybe he should have discussed engagement before proposing. However, she did accept, so he might be right to end it. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is B, No, the author isn't in the wrong because she changed her mind after accepting, and he ended it due to her insensitivity. But I'm not 100% sure. Another angle is that he didn't discuss it with her first, which could be a mistake. But since she said yes, maybe he's justified. I'll go with B.\n"
