I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is at fault. The scenario involves a proposal that was accepted publicly but then retracted later.\n\nFirst, the author planned a public proposal without discussing it with his girlfriend first. She initially said yes, but later changed her mind. The key points here are communication and the pressure of a public setting. Proposing without prior discussion might have contributed to her feeling pressured, especially if she wasn't ready. Her reaction suggests that the sudden, public proposal made her uncomfortable, leading to her change of heart. \n\nThe author felt betrayed when she retracted her acceptance, but she blamed him for moving too fast. Ending the relationship because of this might be his way of dealing with the emotional hurt. However, the question is about who is in the wrong. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, open communication is crucial. The author didn't check in with her about the proposal plans, which could have led to misaligned expectations. On the other hand, her retraction after accepting might be seen as insensitivity because she led him to believe she was okay with the proposal. \n\nBut considering the structure of the question, the options are A (author wrong) or B (author not wrong). The community often looks at both sides. Here, the author's actions (not discussing the proposal) and her reaction (changing her mind) both have their issues. However, the core issue is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't communicate his intentions beforehand, which could have led to her feeling pressured, that's a point against him. But he also had the right to be hurt by her retraction. The answer might hinge on whose actions were more at fault. \n\nIn similar cases, the person who didn't communicate their plans is often seen as contributing to the problem. So, there's a chance the answer is A. However, if the focus is on her changing her mind after accepting, then maybe B. But given that the author didn't discuss the proposal first, leading to her feeling pressured, it's more likely that he's at least partially at fault. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
