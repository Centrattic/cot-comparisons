I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author proposed during a cruise, set up a big event, and the girlfriend said yes. Then later, she changed her mind. The author is upset and ended the relationship, thinking she was insensitive. The user thinks the author is at fault, but I need to decide if that's correct.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author planned a public proposal without discussing it with his girlfriend first. She agreed during the proposal but later changed her mind, saying they were moving too fast. The author feels betrayed and ends the relationship. The girlfriend's reasoning is that the proposal was rushed and public, which might have made her feel pressured.\n\nSo, who is in the wrong here? The author didn't discuss the proposal with her beforehand, which is a big step. Engagement is a serious commitment, and planning a public proposal without checking in with her first could have been a mistake. She said yes publicly, but later changed her mind, which is also a problem. But the root issue might be that the author didn't have an open conversation about their future plans before the proposal. \n\nThe girlfriend's response that they were moving too fast suggests that maybe she wasn't ready for marriage. However, once she said yes, retracting it after the fact could be seen as insensitivity, as the author is now hurt. But the author's approach to the proposal might have contributed to her feeling unprepared. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't talk to her about the proposal plan, which could have led to misunderstandings. However, the girlfriend changing her mind after saying yes is also a significant issue. \n\nI think both parties have some responsibility here. The author's action of not discussing the proposal might have contributed to her feeling pressure, but the girlfriend's retraction after a public commitment is also hurtful. However, since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, I need to weigh these factors. \n\nThe girlfriend's main argument is that the proposal was rushed and public. The author, by not discussing it beforehand, might have forced her into a situation where she felt she had to say yes on the spot. So, maybe the author is at fault for not having those conversations first. On the other hand, the girlfriend's change of heart is also problematic. But the initial mistake was the author not consulting her before the proposal. So perhaps the answer is A.\n"
