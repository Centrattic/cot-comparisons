      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who proposed) is in the wrong after their girlfriend took back her \"yes\" to the proposal. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author set up a public proposal during a cruise, complete with a photographer and champagne. The girlfriend initially said yes, but later changed her mind, leading to the breakup. The author feels hurt and believes she shouldn't have led him on, while she feels he rushed things without discussing it first.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he put in a lot of effort to make the proposal special and meaningful. When she changed her mind, he felt betrayed and ended the relationship. His argument is that she should have been honest from the start instead of accepting the proposal and then backing out. That seems fair because trust and honesty are crucial in relationships, especially when it comes to such a significant commitment as marriage.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's side is that the proposal was public and unplanned without prior discussion. She might have felt pressured into saying yes in the moment, and later realized she wasn't ready. It's possible that she wasn't fully committed and only realized her reservations after the proposal. However, retracting a \"yes\" after a public commitment can be seen as insensitivity, as the author was emotionally invested and hurt.\n\nNow, evaluating who's in the wrong. The key points here are communication and intent. The author didn't discuss the engagement plans with her beforehand, which could have been a misstep. Proposing without prior discussion might have caught her off guard. However, once she said yes, retracting it without a valid reason shows a lack of commitment and consideration for the partner's feelings. \n\nThe author ended the relationship because of her insensitivity, which is understandable given the emotional impact. While the girlfriend's hesitation might be genuine, her decision to accept the proposal and then back out without addressing it properly was hurtful. The author's actions in ending the relationship are a response to the broken trust, not the initial hesitation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author did make a mistake by not discussing the proposal ahead of time, but the girlfriend's main issue was retracting her acceptance without addressing it honestly. However, considering the emotional harm caused by her actions, the author's decision to end the relationship is justified. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
