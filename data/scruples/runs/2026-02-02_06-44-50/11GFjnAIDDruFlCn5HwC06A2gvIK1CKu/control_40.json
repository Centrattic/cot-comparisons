      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal that was accepted but then retracted. The guy proposed on a cruise with a big setup, she said yes, but later changed her mind. He felt betrayed and broke up with her because he thought she led him on. She said it was his fault for not discussing engagement plans first and moving too quickly.\n\nHmm. I need to figure out who's at fault here. The man planned a surprise proposal without discussing it with her first. She claims that's why she said yes in the moment but wasn't ready. He argues she should have communicated her feelings earlier instead of letting him get excited and then changing her mind.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. If he didn't talk to her about his intentions before proposing, maybe he didn't give her a chance to express her feelings. Proposing without discussing engagement could be seen as rushing things. On the other hand, once she said yes, expecting her to back out later might be hurtful. She might have felt pressured in the moment, and he might have misread her readiness.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author (the man) is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether his actions were unreasonable. Planning a proposal without discussing it could be seen as impulsive. However, she had the opportunity to talk to him after saying yes but before the backlash. If she genuinely wasn't ready, maybe she should have communicated that before accepting. But if the proposal was too sudden and she felt pressured, then he's at fault for not checking in. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think both have some responsibility here, but the question is specifically about the author. Since he proceeded with the proposal without discussing it, leading to her not being ready, he might share some blame. However, breaking up because of her change of heart could be his choice. But the main issue is whether his actions were wrong. The answer might be A (he's at fault) because he didn't discuss it first, but others might say B because she changed her mind after accepting. Need to weigh the factors. I'm leaning towards A because not discussing engagement plans before proposing could be a key mistake.\n"
