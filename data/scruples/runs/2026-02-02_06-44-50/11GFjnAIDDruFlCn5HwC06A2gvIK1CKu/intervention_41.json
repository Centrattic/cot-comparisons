      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who proposed is in the wrong after their girlfriend took back her \"yes.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The man planned a public proposal during a cruise, set up with a photographer. She said yes, but later decided she didn't want to marry him. He was devastated, cried, and ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitively leading him on. She blamed him for moving too fast and not discussing the engagement first.\n\nSo, the key points here. The man organized a surprise proposal without prior discussion. The woman said yes during the proposal but later changed her mind. He ended the relationship over this.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author (the proposer) is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know if that's accurate.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, proposing can be a big step. If the proposer didn't discuss the seriousness of the proposal beforehand, maybe he should have. The woman might have felt pressured into saying yes during the emotional moment. However, once she said yes, she's committing to the engagement. Changing her mind after that might be seen as breaking a commitment, even if it's not legally binding.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of readiness. If the woman wasn't ready to get married and didn't communicate that before the proposal, she might be partly responsible. The proposer didn't check if she was ready, just went ahead. However, once she said yes, retracting it could be hurtful.\n\nThe man ended the relationship because he felt she led him on. That might be a reaction to her changing her mind, but maybe he could have handled it differently. However, the woman's actions\u2014saying yes and then backing out\u2014can be seen as insincere, leading to the breakup.\n\nThe crux is whether the proposer's actions were wrong. He didn't discuss the proposal, leading to the woman feeling pressured. But once she accepted, he's justified in feeling betrayed. The woman's change of heart is a problem. But who is more at fault?\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some people might think that proposing without discussing it first is a mistake. Others might say that once she said yes, she should have followed through. However, engagements can be broken for various reasons, so maybe the woman isn't wrong in changing her mind, but she could have handled it better.\n\nThe man ending the relationship because of her insensitivity might be a valid choice, but is he in the wrong for not discussing it first? Possibly. The woman might be at fault for not being honest, but the man's approach to the proposal was also problematic.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the proposer's actions contributed to the confusion. By not talking about the proposal first, he might have set up a situation where the woman felt pressured. However, once she said yes, it's her responsibility to follow through. But if she wasn't ready, then retracting the acceptance is on her. The man's reaction could be seen as fair given the emotional impact. But if the woman was clear she wasn't ready before the proposal, then the proposer is in the wrong. Since she didn't communicate that, maybe she's at fault for the retraction, but the proposer's lack of discussion is a flaw.\n\nIn the end, the proposer might not be in the wrong for ending the relationship after the betrayal, but his approach to the proposal was perhaps hasty. However, the main issue is the woman changing her mind after accepting. So the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because while his approach had issues, the woman's retraction after accepting is the bigger issue.\n"
