I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a proposal that was accepted but then retracted, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The proposer set up a public proposal with a photographer and got a \"yes,\" but later the girlfriend changed her mind. The proposer felt hurt and ended the relationship, while the ex felt the proposal was too rushed and public without prior discussion.\n\nIn terms of engagement expectations, traditionally, a proposal is a mutual commitment. If the proposer went ahead without discussing the engagement first, that might be a point of contention. However, the girlfriend accepted the proposal publicly but then changed her mind, which can be seen as leading him on. \n\nThe key factors here are communication and consent. The proposer might have assumed that a public proposal was okay without checking in with her, which could be his fault. On the other hand, retracting a \"yes\" after a public proposal seems insincere and hurtful. \n\nIn relationships, both parties should communicate their feelings and boundaries. If the proposer didn't discuss the engagement plans beforehand, that's a mistake. But the girlfriend's change of heart after accepting might be more damaging. \n\nSo, there's some fault on both sides. The proposer for not discussing the proposal, the girlfriend for retracting her acceptance. But the question is whether the author (the proposer) is in the wrong. Since he ended the relationship due to her insensitivity, maybe the bigger issue is her actions. However, the initial setup of the proposal without her input could be his fault. \n\nI think both are partially at fault, but the question is specifically asking if the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't consult her before proposing publicly, he shares some blame. However, her retracting the acceptance is worse. The answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he didn't discuss it with her first, which led to the conflict. But others might argue she's more at fault.\n"
