      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is about a proposal gone wrong. The user proposed on a cruise with a photographer, and the girlfriend said yes but then changed her mind. The user is upset and ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, the user set up a public proposal without discussing it with the girlfriend first. The girlfriend felt they were moving too quickly and wasn't ready. The user is asking if they're at fault. \n\nFrom an outsider's perspective, proposing is a big step. Normally, you would talk about the idea of marriage before making a public proposal. If the girlfriend didn't know about the plan and suddenly found herself agreeing under pressure or in a public setting, she might feel cornered. She could have thought she was agreeing to the proposal but later realized she wasn't ready. \n\nThe user might be in the wrong because they didn't communicate their intentions beforehand. Marriage is a major commitment, and proposing without discussing it could lead to the other person feeling pressured. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she wasn't prepared for such a big decision at that moment. \n\nOn the other hand, the user was excited and thought she was saying yes, so he might feel betrayed when she changed her mind. However, the responsibility for ensuring both partners are on the same page before such a proposal is important. If the user had discussed marriage and engagement first, maybe they could have avoided the misunderstanding. \n\nSo, the girlfriend's argument that it was his fault for not talking about it first might hold some weight. The user didn't check in with her about their relationship status regarding marriage, leading to her feeling that things were moving too fast. Therefore, the user might be partially at fault, making the answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
