We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is a proposal that went wrong. The guy planned a big public proposal on a cruise, got a yes, then later the girl changed her mind. He ended the relationship because he felt heartbroken and she was insensitive. The user thinks the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy wanted to get married, so he planned a proposal without discussing it in detail first. Maybe he assumed she was ready, but she wasn't. On the other hand, after accepting, she reversed her decision, which caused emotional pain. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. Traditionally, proposals are meant to be a mutual agreement. If the guy didn't talk to her about wanting to get engaged before planning the big proposal, maybe he didn't give her a chance to express her feelings. But once she said yes, even if it was a mistake, changing her mind afterward is also a problem. \n\nHowever, the girl might have felt pressured or not ready for such a public commitment. The guy's reaction to ending the relationship because of her change of heart could be seen as harsh if he didn't consider that maybe she was scared or had other reasons. \n\nBut the user's main question is whether the author (the guy) is in the wrong. The guy's actions led to the situation where he was heartbroken, and he ended the relationship based on her insensitivity. The girl, on her part, didn't follow through after accepting. \n\nIn many cases, a proposal should be a discussion first. If the guy didn't have that conversation, he might have set himself up for this outcome. However, the girl's behavior of changing her mind after saying yes is also problematic. \n\nSo, is the guy in the wrong? If he didn't communicate his intentions beforehand, maybe he shares some responsibility. But if the girl was insincere in her acceptance and then changed her mind, she's also at fault. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, so maybe they believe the guy should have discussed it more. But the answer might depend on cultural norms or expectations around proposals. In some views, a proposal is a mutual commitment, so she's wrong for retracting. In others, the guy shouldn't have proposed without a conversation. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't have that discussion first, leading to the misunderstanding. However, if the girl was insincere, that's her fault. But since the question is about the author's fault, maybe the answer is A because he didn't communicate properly. Alternatively, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because she broke her commitment. Need to decide based on the details given.\n"
