      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a proposal during a cruise. The author set up a public proposal with a photographer, and when she said yes, they celebrated. But later, she changed her mind and didn't want to marry him. The author is upset, ended the relationship, and is questioning if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue here is the public proposal without prior discussion. The author didn't talk about marriage plans with his girlfriend, which led to her feeling blindsided. She said yes initially but then changed her mind, leading to the breakup. The author is upset because she didn't communicate her feelings beforehand and now is being insensitive.\n\nNow, evaluating the author's actions: Proposing is a significant step in a relationship. It's common to discuss engagement plans before making a proposal, especially a public one. The author went ahead without checking in with her first, which could have led to miscommunication. Public proposals can be exciting but might pressure the other person, even if they seem to be in a good place.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt the proposal came too soon. She might not have been ready for marriage and was uncomfortable with the public setting. Her initial \"yes\" followed by a change of heart might have been a momentary reaction to the proposal's circumstances rather than a genuine commitment. The author is hurt because she didn't communicate her true feelings earlier, but part of the problem is that he didn't confirm her readiness before proceeding.\n\nSo, who's at fault? While the author's intentions were good, not discussing the proposal first could be seen as a misstep. The girlfriend's insensitivity in leading him on is problematic, but the author's approach might have contributed to the situation. Relationships require mutual communication, and both parties have responsibilities. The author's decision to end the relationship might be justified given the insensitivity, but his role in not ensuring her readiness could be a factor. However, the main issue is her change of heart after accepting, which is more directly her responsibility. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't consult her first, he shares some responsibility, but the primary fault lies with her for not being clear. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Based on the situation, the answer is a bit nuanced, but since the options are A (Yes) or B (No), I need to decide. The author's action (public proposal without discussion) might be a mistake, but the main wrong is the girlfriend's change of heart. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. The key here is that he didn't discuss the proposal first. So, perhaps the answer is B (No), because while he made a mistake, the primary fault isn't entirely on him. Alternatively, if the mistake is significant enough, maybe A. But in such scenarios, public proposals without prior discussion can be a point of contention. The girlfriend's reaction is about moving too fast, which the author might have contributed to. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Given that he didn't talk to her first, maybe he shares some responsibility. But the main issue is her backing out. However, the question is about who is in the wrong. Since the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong, the answer could be that he's not entirely in the wrong (B), but perhaps there's some shared responsibility. But the options are A or B. The answer is B (No), meaning the author is not in the wrong. The main problem is the girlfriend's insensitivity and change of heart. The author's proposal, while perhaps impulsive, isn't necessarily wrong. The key is that she didn't communicate her true feelings until after the proposal. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
