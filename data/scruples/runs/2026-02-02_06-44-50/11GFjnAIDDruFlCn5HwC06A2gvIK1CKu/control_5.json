      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let's see... The situation is that the guy proposed on a cruise, set up a big public proposal with a photographer and champagne. His girlfriend said yes, but then later changed her mind. He's upset and ended the relationship. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The man planned a big proposal without discussing it with her first. She said yes initially but then didn't want to go through with the marriage. He feels she led him on, while she claims he moved too quickly without discussing engagement plans.\n\nFrom the man's perspective, he was excited and prepared a grand gesture, expecting her to be ready for marriage. The woman, however, might not have realized the proposal would be so public or that he was serious about getting married. She might have said yes out of the moment's emotion but wasn't ready for a long-term commitment. \n\nThe woman's argument is that he didn't discuss engagement plans with her first. That's a valid point. Proposing without prior discussion about marriage can lead to misunderstandings. The man might have jumped into a proposal without checking if she was truly ready. \n\nBut then she changed her mind after saying yes. That's hurtful. If she wasn't ready, she should have communicated that earlier. However, the man didn't set the stage for a meaningful conversation about their future. Public proposals can be overwhelming and might pressure someone into a hasty \"yes\" they later regret.\n\nSo, both sides have some responsibility. The man didn't discuss engagement, leading her to believe she was okay with it. She didn't communicate her true feelings before saying yes. But since the man initiated the proposal without discussion, he shares some blame. However, she also didn't stand by her initial commitment. \n\nThe user is asking if the author (the man) is in the wrong. The answer would likely be that both are at fault, but since the options are A (yes) or B (no), the closest would be B (no), because the main issue is the lack of prior discussion from the man, but the woman also didn't handle it well. However, in some perspectives, the man's actions led to the problem, so maybe A. Wait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The man didn't ask for her opinion before proposing. That's a key point. So, he is partially at fault. But the woman's reaction of changing her mind is also problematic. The answer is likely that the author is not entirely in the wrong, but there's some shared responsibility. However, since the options are yes or no, and the question is if the author is in the wrong, I need to decide. The main point is that proposing without discussing it first is a mistake, so the author is somewhat at fault. But the woman also didn't stick to her yes. So maybe answer A. Wait, the options are A for yes (author is wrong), B for no. If the answer is that the author is partly wrong, but not entirely, then the correct answer would be that he's not in the wrong. Hmm. This is tricky. I think the answer is B (no) because the woman's refusal to communicate her true feelings and the fact that she changed her mind is more of her fault, but the author's approach was flawed. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer might be A. But I'm a bit confused. Let me check similar cases. Usually, if someone proposes without discussing, they might be seen as moving too fast, but the person who changes their mind after accepting is also in the wrong. So the answer is B (no), the author is not in the wrong. Wait, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The initial proposal without discussion could be considered wrong. So maybe A. But the woman's actions are also wrong. The options are AITA (Am I the Asshole). In AITA threads, the person asking is often considered to be at fault if they made the mistake. In this case, the man didn't discuss engagement, leading to the woman's confusion. So the answer would be A. But the woman also changed her mind. However, the man initiated the problem by not discussing. So the answer is A. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again. If someone sets up a proposal without talking about marriage first, that's a problem. The woman might not have realized the proposal was serious. The man's actions led to the situation. So he's at fault. Therefore, answer A. But the woman is also responsible for changing her mind. However, the question is about the author's fault. So answer A.\n"
