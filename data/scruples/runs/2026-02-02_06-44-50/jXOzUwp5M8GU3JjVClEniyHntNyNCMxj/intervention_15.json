We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for ghosting their friend after she turned them down. They had a good friendship, confessed their feelings, got rejected, and now they're avoiding her. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The friend was clear and kind in the rejection. The author is struggling with their feelings not changing, making it hard to be friends. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. However, the author might be protecting their emotional well-being by avoiding a painful friendship. \n\nOn one hand, the friend is trying to maintain the friendship, which is fair. The author's avoidance could hurt the other person by leaving them confused. But the author isn't being malicious; they're just not ready to handle the friendship anymore. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, ghosting is usually considered inconsiderate, but if the person's feelings are genuine and they can't move past it, maybe it's understandable. However, being upfront about their feelings and the need for space would have been better than ghosting. So maybe the author is partially in the wrong for not communicating their reasons, but their actions stem from emotional pain. \n\nHmm. The key points are: rejection, unrequited feelings, avoidance instead of communication. The author didn't give an explanation, which is where the wrong comes in. They should have been honest about needing time or not being able to continue the friendship. So I think Answer A, the author is in the wrong. They could have handled it more respectfully by explaining their decision instead of ghosting.\n"
