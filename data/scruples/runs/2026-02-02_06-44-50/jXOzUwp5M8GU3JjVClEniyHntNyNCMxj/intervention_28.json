We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person wrote about confessing their feelings to a friend who didn't reciprocate. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author is ghosting them. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to figure out if that's the case.\n\nFirst, the author had feelings and took the step to confess. The friend was kind but turned them down. Now, the author is avoiding the friend, leading to ghosting. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship but the author can't handle it because their feelings haven't changed.\n\nIs the author wrong for doing this? Well, when someone is rejected, it's natural to feel hurt and need space. The author might not be ready to be around their friend because it's painful. However, ghosting without communication can be hurtful. The friend might not understand why they're being ignored, which can lead to confusion or hurt feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend initiated the approach and wants to continue the friendship. The author's avoidance might make it hard for the friend to adjust. The key here is communication. If the author had clearly stated their need for space and explained why, it would be more respectful. Ghosting without any explanation can be seen as inconsiderate, even if the author is struggling with their emotions.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They are not entirely wrong for needing space after rejection, but the way they're handling it (ghosting) without communication might be. The right approach would be to be honest about their feelings and set boundaries while being respectful. Therefore, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because ghosting is generally considered rude, but some might argue B (not in the wrong) because they're dealing with their emotions. However, the consensus is often that communication is key, so the author's actions are inconsiderate, making them at least partially in the wrong.\n"
