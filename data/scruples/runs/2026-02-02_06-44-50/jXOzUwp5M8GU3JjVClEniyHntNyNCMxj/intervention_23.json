We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a friend they liked, confessed their feelings, got rejected, and now they're ghosting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author says they can't be friends anymore because it's too painful. They mention that their feelings haven't changed, so being friends would be hard. On the other hand, the friend wants to continue the friendship and is trying to reach out.\n\nIs it wrong to ghost someone after getting rejected? Well, when someone rejects your romantic feelings, it's natural to feel hurt. But the author chose to ghost, which means cutting off communication completely. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. The friend might be trying to maintain a friendship, but the author is avoiding it because of lingering feelings.\n\nHowever, the author isn't acting out of malice. They're dealing with their emotions and think it's better to distance themselves to avoid ongoing pain. It's a personal choice, but maybe they should have communicated their need for space instead of just ghosting. That way, the friend would understand and not feel ignored.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. Ghosting is usually frowned upon, but the author's reasons are understandable. They might not be in the wrong, but they could have handled it better by setting boundaries and explaining their feelings instead of disappearing. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but with the note that communication could have been better.\n"
