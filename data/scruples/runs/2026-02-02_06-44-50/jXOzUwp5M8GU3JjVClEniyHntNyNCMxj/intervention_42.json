We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The situation is that they had a close friendship since spring, shared interests, and the author developed feelings. They confessed, got rejected, and now the friend is trying to maintain the friendship, but the author is avoiding her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. They might be feeling hurt and unable to handle the friendship anymore because their feelings haven't changed. Ghosting is usually seen as inconsiderate, but maybe in this case, the author is trying to protect themselves. However, the friend is still interested in staying in touch, so ghosting without communication could leave the friend confused or hurt.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend turned them down, and the author might genuinely not be able to handle the friendship anymore. It's their right to step back if being around the friend is too painful. The key point here is whether ghosting is the right approach. Instead of cutting off suddenly, maybe the author should have communicated their need for space clearly. That way, the friend understands and both parties can respect each other's feelings.\n\nSo, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because it's tough to be around someone you still have feelings for. But the way they handled it by ghosting could be seen as unfair to the friend who wants to keep the relationship. The right approach would be to explain their feelings and set boundaries, even if they can't be friends anymore. Therefore, the author is partly in the wrong for not having a conversation and choosing to ghost instead. The answer might be A, but there's nuance. However, since the user thinks the author is in the wrong and the community often frowns on ghosting, even in such cases, the answer is likely A.\n"
