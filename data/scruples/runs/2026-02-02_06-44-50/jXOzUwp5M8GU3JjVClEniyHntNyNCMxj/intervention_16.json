We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a friend since spring, got close, then developed feelings. They asked the friend out, and she politely rejected them. Now, the author is avoiding her texts and interactions, leading to ghosting. The friend still wants to be friends, but the author can't handle the pain of being around her.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they were honest about their feelings, and the friend didn't reciprocate. The author's problem is that they can't go back to the old friendship. Ghosting is usually considered rude because it's abrupt and doesn't communicate clearly. However, the author's reasoning is that staying friends would be painful, and they don't want to hurt her by pretending. \n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Instead of ghosting, the author could have communicated that they need space or that they can't continue the friendship. Ghosting leaves the other person confused and hurt. The friend is trying to reach out, which shows she's willing to work it out. The author's avoidance might be hurting her more than respecting her boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author truly can't handle the friendship anymore, it's their right to step back. But doing it without explanation is where the issue lies. So, the author is in the wrong for not communicating their needs clearly and choosing to ghost instead of having an honest conversation.\n"
