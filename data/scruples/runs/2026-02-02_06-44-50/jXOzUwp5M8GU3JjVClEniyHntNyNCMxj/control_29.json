      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author has a friend they've known since spring. They developed feelings but were too scared to act until they confessed. The friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. Now, the author is ghosting her, ignoring texts and avoiding her. The friend still wants to be friends, but the author can't see how they can stay friends because their feelings haven't changed and it's painful.\n\nHmm, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me think. When someone has unrequited feelings, it's tough. Ghosting can be hurtful, but maybe the author is trying to protect themselves from ongoing pain. The friend wants to continue the relationship, which is understandable, but the author isn't ready. Ghosting isn't ideal because it can leave the other person confused, but if the author can't handle the friendship anymore, maybe it's their right to step back. However, a more mature approach would be to explain that they need space, rather than ghosting. But the key here is the author's emotional state. If they genuinely can't be friends and it's causing them pain, maybe it's not entirely their fault. Still, ghosting is often seen as inconsiderate. So is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, they're not obligated to maintain a friendship that's painful. On the other hand, communication would be better than cutting off completely. The answer might depend on cultural or personal views on relationships. But in many cases, people might say that while the author is hurting, ghosting isn't the solution. So maybe they are in the wrong, but there's understanding. Wait, but the question is if they are in the wrong. AITA often has a tendency to lean towards the person being in the right if their actions are self-protective but handled poorly. But ghosting is generally frowned upon. So the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because they're avoiding communication and their friend is trying to maintain the friendship. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because they have a valid reason for needing space. I think it's a tricky one. But typically, ghosting is seen as inconsiderate, even if you have reasons. So the author is in the wrong for not communicating their feelings and instead cutting off. They could have been honest about not being able to be friends and needed space. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
