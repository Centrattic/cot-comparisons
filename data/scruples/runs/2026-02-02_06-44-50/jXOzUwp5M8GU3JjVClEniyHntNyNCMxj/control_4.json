We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The person had a friend they've known since spring, got close, then developed feelings. They confessed, and the friend didn't reciprocate. The friend wants to continue being friends, but the person can't handle it and has been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. The question is whether this action is wrong.\n\nSo, thinking about this. Ghosting usually refers to cutting off all communication without explanation, which can be hurtful. The user's situation is after being rejected in a romantic sense. The person is struggling to maintain the friendship because their feelings haven't changed. They're avoiding the friend to prevent pain.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, maybe. Ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate, even if the person is hurt. It leaves the other person confused and might make them feel dismissed. The friend is trying to be understanding and wants to stay friends, but the author is choosing to ignore her. However, the author is also dealing with unrequited feelings and the emotional difficulty of maintaining the friendship. \n\nBut in social norms, it's often better to communicate even if you can't be friends. If you can't handle the friendship, it's better to explain that rather than ghosting. Ghosting can be hurtful regardless of the situation because it's a lack of communication. The friend might not know how to approach it again or might feel rejected again. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is dealing with their own emotions, and maybe they don't have the capacity to handle the friendship right now. But the issue is that the friend is trying to maintain the relationship, and the author is not responding. The author could have been honest but chose not to. \n\nSo, is it inconsiderate? Probably. Even if the feelings are unrequited, the friend is trying to salvage the friendship. The author's ghosting might be seen as the wrong approach because it's not communicative. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). However, some might argue that they have a right to distance themselves for their own well-being. But usually, ghosting is frowned upon, so the answer is likely A.\n"
