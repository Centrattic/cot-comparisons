We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. Let's break down the situation. The author had a friendship with someone they liked, confessed their feelings, got rejected, and now is avoiding the person. \n\nFirst, the author didn't ask for the friend's permission before confessing, which is a bit of a problem. But the friend was nice about it and wanted to stay friends. The author, however, can't handle being friends anymore because it's painful. Ghosting is a way to avoid the discomfort.\n\nIs it wrong to ghost? Well, ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. The friend is trying to reach out, which shows they're still willing to maintain the relationship, even if it's platonic. The author might be avoiding their own feelings, but that doesn't make it right. The friend didn't do anything wrong, so the author is maybe being selfish here. They could have been honest about needing space or expressed that they can't continue the friendship and why, instead of just cutting off contact. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is dealing with emotional pain, which is understandable. They might not have the emotional strength to maintain the friendship. But that doesn't excuse ghosting. Communication is key in any relationship, even if it's tough. So the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation more maturely by at least explaining their feelings and intentions.\n"
