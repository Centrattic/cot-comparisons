There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they had a friend since spring, got close, then the author developed feelings and asked her out. She turned them down, and now the author is ghosting her.\n\nFirst, the author says they don't hold it against her, but they can't go back to the friendship. The friend wants to stay in touch, but the author is avoiding her. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. From my understanding, when someone is rejected, it's common to feel hurt or unable to maintain the same relationship. The author might be doing this to protect themselves from ongoing pain. But is it wrong to ghost someone after being rejected?\n\nWell, ghosting usually means cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The article mentions that the friend is trying to reach out and wants to continue the friendship. The author is ignoring texts, which could be seen as dismissive. However, the author's reasoning is that being friends would be painful because their feelings haven't changed.\n\nIs there a better way to handle this? The author could have explained their need for space instead of just ignoring her. But maybe they're still processing their emotions and can't handle the friendship yet. On one hand, it's understandable to need time. On the other hand, not communicating can be hurtful, even if it's for a reason.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author approached the friend first and was turned down might mean the friend is trying to be kind. Ghosting could make her feel bad, even if she said she wants to stay friends. The author might not be in the wrong because they're dealing with emotional pain, but maybe they could have been more open about their need for space. So, is it A or B? I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong, because they're acting on their own emotional needs, though perhaps they should have communicated better.\n"
