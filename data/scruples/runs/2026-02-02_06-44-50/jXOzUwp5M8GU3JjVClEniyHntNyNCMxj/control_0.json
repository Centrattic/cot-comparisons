      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. Let me break this down. First, the person had a close friendship with someone they've known since spring. They developed feelings but didn't act on them until they confessed. The friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. Now, the friend wants to continue the friendship, but the author is avoiding her because it's painful.\n\nHmm, the question is whether the author is wrong. The key points here are the nature of the relationship before the confession, how the friend responded, and the author's current actions. Ghosting usually means cutting off communication abruptly without explanation, which can be hurtful. But in this case, the author is avoiding the friend because they can't handle the pain of continuing the friendship after rejection. The friend is trying to reach out, but the author isn't responding. \n\nOn one hand, not communicating is generally considered ghosting, which is rude. But the author might be dealing with strong emotions. The friend didn't reciprocate, and the author can't see how the friendship can continue. However, maybe the author could have been more honest about their feelings instead of just disappearing. The friend wants to stay in touch, so maybe there's a way to set boundaries or take a break without completely cutting off contact. \n\nI wonder if the author gave the friend a chance to adjust or if they just stopped responding. If they're being ignored, the friend might feel confused or hurt, even if the author's intention is to protect their own feelings. The right thing would be to communicate, even if it's difficult. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they're not addressing the situation openly. But I also see that the author is struggling with their emotions, so it's not entirely clear-cut. \n\nWait, the friend was nice about the rejection, which is good. But the author is avoiding her now. The friend might still want to be friends, but the author is making it hard by not responding. Ghosting can leave the other person hanging, not knowing why. So even if the author is hurt, they should explain their need for space. Maybe the author is in the wrong for not being honest and instead choosing to ghost. Alternatively, if the author is truly unable to handle the friendship anymore, they might not be in the wrong for taking a step back, but the method (ghosting) is probably not the best approach. \n\nThe community usually frowns on ghosting because it's inconsiderate. So even if the reason is emotional pain, the action of ghosting is still wrong. The author should have communicated their feelings about needing space instead of just disappearing. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong) because they're not giving the friend a clear explanation and are avoiding communication.\n"
