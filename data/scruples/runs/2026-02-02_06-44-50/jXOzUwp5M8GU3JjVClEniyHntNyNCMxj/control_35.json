We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is: the user has a friend they've known since spring, they had a good friendship, same interests. The user developed feelings for this friend, waited too long, then confessed. The friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. Now the user is ghosting her, ignoring texts, avoiding her, saying they can't be friends anymore because it's too painful. The friend wants to continue the friendship, but the user can't go back to how things were.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the user is in the wrong. The user's actions are ghosting after being rejected. Ghosting is usually considered inconsiderate because you just disappear without explanation. But why is the user doing this? They say their feelings haven't changed, and being friends would be painful. The user feels that they can't go back to the previous friendship because of lingering feelings. \n\nThe friend, on the other hand, is trying to maintain the relationship, wants to stay friends. The user is cutting off communication, maybe to protect their own feelings. But is it fair to the friend? The user isn't blaming the friend, but the friend might be confused or hurt by being ghosted. \n\nIn relationships like this, when someone is rejected, they might need space to process. However, ghosting is generally seen as a poor way to handle it. The user could have explained their need for space, communicated their feelings, even if they can't continue the friendship. By not communicating, the friend is left in the dark. \n\nBut the user's reasoning is that they can't be friends anymore. If they genuinely can't maintain the friendship without pain, maybe they're being honest about their emotional state. However, the way they're handling it (ghosting) is the issue, not necessarily the decision to distance themselves. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. They're not wrong for needing space, but they are wrong for not communicating. Ghosting is often seen as inconsiderate. So maybe the answer is A, they are in the wrong for ghosting, but not necessarily for wanting space. The right approach would have been to explain their feelings and set boundaries respectfully. Since they didn't, the answer might be A. But some might argue B, that they're not in the wrong because they're protecting their own feelings. But the community might lean towards A because ghosting is rude regardless of the reason.\n"
