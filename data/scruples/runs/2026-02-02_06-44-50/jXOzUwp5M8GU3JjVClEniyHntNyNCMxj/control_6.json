We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. So the situation is that they had a friend since spring, developed feelings, confessed, got rejected, and now they're avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author liked their friend, asked them out, and the friend said no. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author can't handle the pain of remaining friends. They're ghosting now.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, ghosting is generally seen as rude because you cut off communication without explanation. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship, but the author is avoiding them. The author's reasoning is that being friends would be painful because their feelings haven't changed. \n\nOn one hand, the author is hurting by not being able to move on. On the other, the friend is left confused and possibly hurt by the sudden avoidance. The question is about whether the author is wrong. \n\nIn many cases, people are advised to communicate their feelings honestly, even if they can't stay friends. Ghosting can be seen as a lack of respect for the other person's feelings. However, the author is in emotional pain and might not be ready to handle the friendship. \n\nBut is that a valid excuse? Maybe they should have communicated their need for space instead of ghosting. So the author might be in the wrong because they didn't explain their actions, leading the friend to feel rejected again. The answer could be A (yes, wrong) because ghosting is typically considered inconsiderate. Alternatively, B (not wrong) if the emotional pain justifies their actions. \n\nBut usually, even if you can't be friends, being honest and explaining is better than ghosting. So the answer is probably A.\n"
