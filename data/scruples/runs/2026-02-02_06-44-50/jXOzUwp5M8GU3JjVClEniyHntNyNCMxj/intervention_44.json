We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted their friend after being rejected is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a friendship, developed feelings, confessed, got rejected, and then decided to ghost because they couldn't be friends anymore.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: the friend was nice but didn't reciprocate, the author can't go back to being friends, and they're avoiding her. The user thinks the author might be in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of ghosting. Ghosting usually means cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The author is avoiding texts and interactions, which could be seen as ghosting. Even if the friend wanted to continue the relationship, the author's actions might be hurtful. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of emotional pain. The author is struggling with unrequited feelings and finds it painful to maintain the friendship. They might not want to pretend everything's okay when they're still in love. Is it fair to force a friendship if it's not healthy for either party?\n\nOn the other hand, the friend who rejected them might be trying to move on and maintain a positive relationship. The author's ghosting could leave the friend confused or hurt, especially if they're reaching out and getting no response. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might be, because ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate. A better approach would be to have a clear conversation about why they can't continue the friendship, even if it's uncomfortable. Avoiding communication without explanation can leave the other person in limbo. \n\nBut then again, the author is also dealing with their emotions. They might not be ready to have that conversation. However, cutting someone off completely without any explanation is generally considered rude, regardless of the reason. The friend deserves some closure, even if the author can't be friends anymore. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong for ghosting. They should have communicated their feelings and boundaries instead of disappearing. Even if the friendship can't continue, being honest would be better than ghosting.\n"
