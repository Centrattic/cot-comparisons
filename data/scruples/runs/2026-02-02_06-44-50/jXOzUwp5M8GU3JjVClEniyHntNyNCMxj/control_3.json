We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a friend they liked, confessed their feelings, got turned down, and now are ghosting the friend. The friend wants to stay in touch, but the author can't handle it and is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions are justified. The author says they don't hold anything against their friend but can't see how they can be friends anymore because their feelings haven't changed. They're choosing to ghost instead of communicating.\n\nOn one hand, ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author isn't responding, which is hurtful. However, the author is dealing with emotional pain and might not be in a place where they can handle the friendship right now. It's possible they need time to process their feelings.\n\nBut the key issue here is communication. Instead of ghosting, the author could have explained their need for space. Ghosting can make the friend feel rejected again, even though the author isn't rejecting them as a person, just the relationship dynamic. The author isn't wrong for needing time, but the method of handling it (ghosting) is where the issue lies. They might not be in the wrong morally, but they're definitely not handling it well. The right approach would be to be honest about their feelings without being cruel. So, the answer might be A, but I need to consider if there's any nuance I'm missing. Maybe the author is justified in needing space, but the way they're doing it is wrong. Since the question is whether they're in the wrong, the act of ghosting without explanation is the problem. So the answer is A.\n"
