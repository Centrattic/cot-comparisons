      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through their situation again. They had a friend since spring, and they developed feelings for her. They confessed, but she turned them down. Now they're avoiding her because they can't be friends anymore. The question is whether they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I should consider the basics of friendship and romantic feelings. When someone has a crush on a friend, it's a common situation. The person took the risk to confess, which is brave, even if it didn't work out. The friend was nice but not interested. Now, the problem is the aftermath. \n\nThe writer is avoiding the friend because they can't handle being just friends anymore. That makes sense emotionally. It's hard to remain close after having unrequited feelings. But is avoiding them the right approach? Maybe there's a middle ground. Like, being honest about needing some space but still maintaining a respectful relationship. \n\nHowever, the friend is trying to stay in touch, which can be tough for the person who's hurt. The writer might feel that staying in the friendship is painful. They might need time to heal. But ghosting\u2014completely cutting off communication\u2014can be seen as inconsiderate. The friend might not know why they're being ignored, leading to confusion or hurt feelings on her side. \n\nIs the writer wrong for doing this? Well, they're dealing with their own emotions. But maybe they should have communicated better. If they had explained that they need space because it's hard to be friends after rejection, that might be more respectful. Ghosting without any explanation can leave the other person in the dark, which is unfair. \n\nSo, the writer's intention isn't malicious; they're trying to protect their own feelings. But the action of ghosting is causing harm to the friend. The right approach would have been to set boundaries clearly and kindly. Therefore, the writer isn't entirely in the wrong, but they could have handled it better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since ghosting is generally considered inconsiderate, maybe the answer is that they are at fault. But if the situation is about their own emotional state and they can't maintain the friendship, then it's more about personal choice. \n\nHmm. It's a tricky one. If they can't be friends and need space, that's understandable. But not communicating that is where the issue lies. So maybe the answer is that they are at fault because they didn't explain their actions, even if their feelings are valid. So Answer A (they are in the wrong) or B (they are not)? Maybe B because they're dealing with their emotions and need time, but perhaps they should have communicated. But the act of ghosting is the problem. So maybe A. I'm a bit torn here. But in many cases, people are advised to be honest rather than ghost. So if they chose to ghost instead of explaining, that's the wrong part. Therefore, Answer A.\n"
