We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting a friend after she turned them down. The situation is that they had a friendship, they developed feelings, confessed, got rejected, and now they're avoiding the friend. The user's friend wants to stay friends, but the author can't handle it and is ghosting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that their feelings haven't changed and being friends would be painful. On the other hand, the friend is trying to maintain the relationship, which the author is ignoring.\n\nIs it wrong to ghost? Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure. The author could have communicated their need for space or explained why they can't continue the friendship. By just ignoring texts and avoiding her, they're not being honest, which might hurt the friend more in the long run.\n\nHowever, the author's feelings are valid. They might genuinely not be able to handle the friendship anymore. But instead of cutting off completely, maybe they should have been upfront about their feelings. The key here is communication. If the author had said, \"I'm not ready to be friends right now,\" that's different from ghosting. So, the wrong here is not necessarily in feeling that way, but in the method of handling it. Ghosting is the issue, not the desire to distance themselves.\n"
