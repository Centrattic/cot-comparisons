We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.

There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a friend they've known since spring, developed feelings, confessed them, got turned down, and now are ghosting her because it's too painful to stay friends. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a friendship that was close, then developed romantic feelings. Confessed, but the friend didn't reciprocate. The friend still wants to continue the friendship, but the author can't handle the pain and is avoiding them. \n\nSo, the key points here: did the author act wrong by ghosting after being rejected? Let's break it down. When someone confesses their feelings and is rejected, it's natural to feel hurt. The author is struggling with the transition from a potentially romantic relationship to just friends. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship, but the author is finding it painful and so they're cutting off communication. \n\nIs it wrong to prioritize their own emotional well-being? On one hand, being abrupt or ghosting can be inconsiderate. The friend might be confused or hurt, especially if she wants to stay in touch. The author didn't explain their feelings clearly, just ignored texts. That could be seen as selfish because the friend has no idea what's going on. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author is dealing with unrequited feelings and needs space to heal. Maybe they don't have the emotional capacity to maintain the friendship right now. It's not like they're doing it out of malice. They might think that being friends would be too painful and that the best way is to step back. \n\nHowever, the proper approach would be to communicate openly, even if it's hard. Telling the friend that they need space, rather than ghosting. Ghosting leaves the other person in the dark and can be hurtful. The friend might value the friendship and be confused why it's ending suddenly. \n\nSo, even though the author's feelings are valid, the way they're handling it by ghosting is inconsiderate. They should have had a conversation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not communicating their reasons. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the action (ghosting) is wrong despite valid reasons. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people are often called out for not being upfront. So even if the author's feelings are justified, not communicating is seen as wrong. Hence, the answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong). But maybe some people would say B because the feelings are valid. But I think the consensus would lean towards A because ghosting is generally frowned upon, especially when the other person is trying to maintain the friendship. The author should have at least explained their need for space.\n"
