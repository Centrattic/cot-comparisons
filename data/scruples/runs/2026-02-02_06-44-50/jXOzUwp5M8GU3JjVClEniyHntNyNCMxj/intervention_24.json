We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ghosting a friend after being turned down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a good friendship with someone since spring. They developed feelings, confessed, and were rejected. The friend is still nice and wants to maintain the friendship, but the author is avoiding them, leading to being ghosted. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. So, I need to evaluate the ethics here. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel that being in a friendship after rejection is painful because their feelings haven't changed. They might believe that cutting off contact is necessary for their emotional well-being. However, ghosting is generally seen as unkind because it leaves the other person without closure. The friend is making efforts to stay in touch, which shows they value the friendship.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend who rejected them might not have anticipated the impact of the rejection. The author's actions could be seen as selfish if they don't communicate their need for space, but it's also a personal struggle. However, the key point is that the author isn't communicating their reasons. Instead of explaining their feelings and the need for distance, they're ignoring texts and avoiding interactions. That lack of communication can be hurtful.\n\nIn relationships, even friendships, honesty and communication are important. If the author can't continue the friendship, they should explain their feelings to the friend respectfully rather than ghosting. Ghosting doesn't address the issue and can leave the other person confused or feeling devalued. \n\nSo, while the author's feelings are valid, the way they're handling the situation\u2014without communication\u2014is where they might be in the wrong. The right approach would be to have an honest conversation about their inability to continue the friendship, even if it's difficult. Ghosting avoids that responsibility and can be seen as inconsiderate, even if the feelings are genuine.\n"
