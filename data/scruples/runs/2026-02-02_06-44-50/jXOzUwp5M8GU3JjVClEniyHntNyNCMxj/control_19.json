We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted their friend after being rejected is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The user had a friend they liked, confessed their feelings, got rejected, and then decided to ghost the friend. The friend wants to continue the friendship, but the user can't handle the pain of staying friends and is avoiding them.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Let's consider the options. The key points here are the user's actions and motivations. The user wasn't angry or vindictive; they're just struggling with their feelings. Ghosting is usually seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused. However, the user's reasoning is that maintaining the friendship is painful because their feelings haven't changed.\n\nOn one hand, communication is important. The user could have explained their feelings and the need for space instead of cutting off abruptly. That would have been more respectful. But on the other hand, they're dealing with emotional pain and may not have the capacity to handle the friendship right now.\n\nIn some cases, taking a step back to protect one's emotional well-being is understandable. However, ghosting without explanation can be hurtful, even if the intention isn't to be. The friend was trying to maintain the relationship, but the user's avoidance might make it harder for the friend to understand or accept the situation.\n\nSo, while the user isn't malicious, their approach could be improved. They might not be entirely in the wrong, but they could have handled it better. The answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because their actions are driven by personal emotional needs, not malice. However, the lack of communication is a downside. But in AITA scenarios, people are often judged based on intent and actions. Here, the intent wasn't to hurt, but the action (ghosting) is what's questioned. However, given the context, it's a tough call. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because they're prioritizing their own well-being, even if it's not the most considerate approach.\n"
