I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.

There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The situation is that the friend turned them down when they asked her out, and now the author is avoiding her texts and trying to distance themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a friendship with someone they've known since spring, shared interests, and developed feelings. They confessed, got rejected, and now they're struggling with continuing the friendship. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship, but the author feels it's too painful and has started ghosting.\n\nIs the author wrong for doing this? Well, after a romantic rejection, it's common for people to need space. The author's feelings haven't changed, so staying friends might be hard. Ghosting is generally considered rude, but the key here is the reason. If the author is protecting their own emotional well-being, maybe they're justified. However, ghosting without communication can be hurtful. The friend is trying to stay in touch, and the author isn't giving a clear explanation. \n\nBut is it their fault? The author isn't forcing the friendship; they're just not responding. The friend initiated contact, and the author is choosing to not engage. The question is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing their own healing by creating distance. Some might say the correct approach is to be honest but kind, like explaining that they need time. But if the author isn't ready to face the situation, can they be blamed? \n\nOn the other hand, ignoring someone after a rejection could be seen as avoiding the situation instead of addressing it. The friend might feel confused or hurt by the sudden silence. However, the author isn't malicious; they just can't handle the friendship anymore. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's actions are hurtful but come from a place of pain. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author needs to process their feelings. The key point is whether the author is wrong. Since they're not being intentionally cruel, maybe they aren't in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), but I need to make sure. Alternatively, maybe they are in the wrong for not communicating, so A. Hmm.\n\nI think the community usually gives some leeway when someone is dealing with rejection. If the author's actions are to protect themselves, they might not be in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
