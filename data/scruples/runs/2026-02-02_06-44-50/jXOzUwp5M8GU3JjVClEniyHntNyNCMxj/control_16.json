We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The situation is that the author had a friend they liked, confessed their feelings, got rejected, and now is avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author liked their friend, asked them out, and was rejected. The friend still wants to be friends, but the author can't handle the pain and is ghosting them. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, after a rejection, it's common to feel hurt. If the author can't maintain the friendship without pain, maybe it's understandable to take a step back. But ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate because the friend is trying to stay in touch. However, the author isn't being hostile; they're just avoiding because of unresolved feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend wants to continue the relationship as friends, and the author's avoidance might be making it hard for the friend. The author might need to communicate that they need space rather than just ghosting. But if they truly can't be friends and it's causing them pain, maybe it's not entirely their fault. \n\nSo, is it their fault? It's a tough call. Ghosting is usually frowned upon, but if the person is emotionally overwhelmed, maybe they're not entirely in the wrong. The answer might hinge on whether the author made an effort to communicate their need for space instead of just cutting off. If they didn't, then maybe they are in the wrong. But if they're still processing emotions, it's a bit more complex. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author's feelings are valid, and sometimes people need time. But they could have handled it better by communicating. However, the question is if they're in the wrong. Since the author isn't being malicious, just hurt, maybe B is the answer.\n"
