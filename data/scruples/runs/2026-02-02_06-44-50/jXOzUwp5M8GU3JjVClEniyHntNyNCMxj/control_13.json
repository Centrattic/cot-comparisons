We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting a friend after being rejected. So the situation is: they had a close friendship, the author developed feelings, confessed, got rejected, and now is avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend didn't reciprocate, and the author is struggling to maintain the friendship because their feelings haven't changed. The friend is trying to stay in touch, but the author is ghosting them.\n\nSo, the key points here. Ghosting is generally considered bad because it's abrupt and uncommunicative. But the author's reasoning is that continuing the friendship is painful. Is it wrong to prioritize their own emotional well-being? On the other hand, the friend might feel hurt by being ignored without explanation.\n\nThe author isn't holding a grudge, which is a positive. They're not being vindictive, just trying to protect themselves. But is ghosting the right approach? Maybe they should have communicated their need for space instead of cutting off contact suddenly. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nGhosting is often seen as inconsiderate, regardless of the reason. Even if the author is hurt, not responding can be hurtful to the other person. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't explain their actions. But if the friendship is unworkable due to lingering feelings, maybe it's understandable. However, the right thing would be to communicate that they need time or space, rather than ghosting. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because ghosting is generally considered rude, even if the person is upset. The author should have communicated their feelings instead of disappearing. Alternatively, if the friendship is too painful, maybe it's not entirely their fault, but the act of ghosting itself is wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
