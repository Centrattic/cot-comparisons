We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting a friend after being rejected. The scenario is that they had a good friendship, the author developed feelings, confessed them, and was turned down. Now, the friend is trying to maintain the friendship, but the author is avoiding her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the situation. The author was friends first, then had a crush, and after rejection, chose to ghost. Ghosting usually means cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The friend is still trying to reach out, wanting to keep the friendship, but the author is ignoring her. \n\nIs the author at fault here? Well, from a friendship perspective, maintaining the relationship is usually important. If one friend is making an effort to stay in touch, it's generally considered inconsiderate to just ghost them, especially if there's no clear communication. The author's reasoning is that staying friends would be painful because their feelings haven't changed. But that's a personal struggle. However, a friend might be expected to make an effort for the other's sake, unless there's a valid reason to avoid contact.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is genuinely unable to handle the friendship post-rejection, maybe they need space. But the right way to handle that would be to explain their situation, so the other person isn't left confused. Ghosting without any explanation can leave the friend feeling hurt or rejected again, even if the author isn't romantically interested anymore. \n\nSo, the author is choosing to ignore the friend's attempts to communicate. That seems like a breach of friendship norms. Even if the author feels it's painful to stay friends, the lack of communication is the issue here. The friend might not know how to respect the author's boundaries if they don't get an explanation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not communicating their feelings and instead just disappearing. The correct answer would be A.\n"
