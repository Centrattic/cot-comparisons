      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they had a friend they really liked, confessed their feelings, got turned down, and then started ghosting the friend. The user is asking if they're the a**hole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the situation. The author had a friendship that turned into a crush, confessed, and the friend said no. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author can't handle it because their feelings haven't changed. The author is now ignoring texts and avoiding the person. \n\nHmm. Is ghosting the right move here? Ghosting is usually seen as cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The author is doing that because they find it painful to stay in the friendship. The friend, on the other hand, is trying to maintain the relationship. \n\nBut here's the thing: the author's actions are understandable emotionally. It's hard to be friends with someone you still have feelings for, especially after rejection. However, ghosting can be hurtful to the other person. The friend might feel confused, rejected again, or even more upset because they're trying to keep the friendship alive. \n\nIs the author wrong for ghosting? Well, maybe not entirely. They have a valid reason\u2014emotional pain. But maybe they could have handled it better. Like, instead of ghosting, they could have communicated their feelings clearly, explaining that they can't be friends right now because it's too hard. That would be more considerate. Ghosting leaves the other person in the dark, which is generally frowned upon. \n\nBut the author did say that they don't hold it against their friend and it's a Pandora's box. Maybe they feel like maintaining the friendship is impossible. Still, not communicating is the issue here. So, is the author in the wrong? If they had a conversation, maybe they could have set boundaries without ghosting. Since they didn't, the ghosting part is where the \"wrong\" would lie. \n\nAlternatively, sometimes people just need space, and if they tried to communicate and it didn't work, maybe ghosting is a last resort. But the key here is that the author hasn't communicated. They've just stopped responding. So, the friend might not know the reason. \n\nIn AITA situations, the common advice is that communication is key. Without it, even if you have a reason, you're not being considerate. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not explaining their side and just cutting off contact. Even if they can't be friends, a clear message would be better. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (yes, in the wrong) because they're ghosting without explanation, which is inconsiderate, even if their feelings are hurt. The right thing would be to communicate their need for space or time, but not to disappear without a word.\n"
