      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author has been friends with someone since last spring. They got along well and shared interests. The author developed feelings for this friend but was too scared to act on them. Eventually, they confessed their feelings and asked her out. She was nice but didn't reciprocate. Now, the author can't see how they can remain friends because their feelings haven't changed, and being in the friendship is painful. So they've been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. The friend wants to stay friends and reach out, but the author isn't responding. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (answer A) or not (answer B).\n\nFirst, let me consider the context. The author had a friendship that was fine until they expressed romantic feelings. The friend rejected them, but still wants to continue the friendship. The author, however, is finding it hard to go back to just being friends and is ghosting the friend. \n\nI know that when someone expresses romantic feelings and is rejected, it can be really tough. The author is avoiding the pain by cutting off contact. But is that fair to the friend? The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, so ignoring her might be hurtful. On the other hand, the author is not holding a grudge, which is a good sign. They don't think negatively of her, but they can't handle the situation anymore.\n\nI remember that sometimes, after a rejection, it's hard to be around the person even as a friend. The author might be doing this to protect themselves. The problem is that the friend is trying to reach out, and ghosting can leave the other person confused or feeling more rejected. But the author isn't being mean about it; they just can't handle the friendship anymore. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, I think it depends on the circumstances. The author isn't in the wrong for having feelings or for needing space. However, ignoring someone who is trying to maintain a friendship might be considered inconsiderate. The better approach would be to communicate honestly, but since the author is avoiding contact, they might not be handling it well. \n\nBut wait, the friend was the one who turned them down. The author's feelings are still there, so maybe the friendship is no longer possible. If both parties can't move past the rejection, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship. However, ghosting is usually seen as a poor way to handle a breakup or a friendship issue. \n\nSo the key points are: the author confessed, was rejected, and now is struggling to maintain the friendship. They are not being hostile, just avoiding. The friend is making efforts to stay in touch. The author's actions might be wrong because they could be making the friend feel worse without a proper explanation. But if the author's feelings are too strong to allow a friendship, maybe they have a valid reason. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because their feelings are real and they can't force themselves to be friends. However, it's still better to communicate rather than ghost. But the question is if they are in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. The friend was clear that she doesn't want to stop being friends, but the author can't handle it. The author's actions are ghosting, which is usually frowned upon. However, their intention isn't malicious. It's more about personal pain. \n\nIn \"Am I the Asshole\" contexts, sometimes the answer is that the person isn't in the wrong if their actions stem from personal issues rather than being cruel. So maybe B (No) is the right answer here. But I'm a bit conflicted because ghosting is typically seen as bad, but the author's explanation is valid. \n\nI need to decide if the author's behavior is wrong. Since they are not being mean, just avoiding due to emotional pain, and the friend is the one who initiated the rejection, the author might not be in the wrong. The friend might need to accept that the friendship can't continue for the author. So the answer would be B.\n"
