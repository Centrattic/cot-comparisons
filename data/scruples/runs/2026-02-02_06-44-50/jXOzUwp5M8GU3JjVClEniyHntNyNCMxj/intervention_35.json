We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The friend turned them down, and now they're ignoring her texts and avoiding her because they still have feelings and find it painful to be friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author had a close friendship, developed feelings, confessed, got rejected but in a kind way. The friend wants to stay in touch, but the author can't handle it and is ghosting. \n\nThe main issue here is whether ghosting is justified. Ghosting usually means cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The author is avoiding the friend because they're still in love, so they can't move past it. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, in relationships, if someone you're close to rejects your romantic feelings, it's natural to feel hurt and need time. However, completely cutting them off without communication might be seen as inconsiderate. The author could have explained their feelings without being confrontational, but instead, they're just ignoring the friend. The friend is trying to reach out, which shows she cares to maintain the friendship, but the author is not responding. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be struggling with their emotions and not be ready to handle the friendship. They might need time and space. But ghosting can be hurtful to the other person because it leaves them confused and not knowing why they're being ignored. \n\nThe key here is communication. If the author is not ready to be friends, they should let the friend know, even if it's difficult. Ignoring texts and avoiding doesn't allow for that. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not communicating their need for space, rather than just disappearing. \n\nBut then again, the author's feelings are valid. They can't just pretend they don't have feelings. However, maybe they could take a break from the friendship and then reassess later. Ghosting is a harsh way to handle it. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because they're not communicating and are being inconsiderate of the friend's efforts to maintain the relationship. Alternatively, if they're genuinely unable to handle the friendship, maybe it's not entirely their fault. But generally, ghosting is seen as rude, so the author is probably in the wrong.\n"
