We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. I need to determine if the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, let me break down the situation. The author had a close friend they've known since spring, shared interests, and they developed feelings. They confessed their feelings, got rejected but politely, and now the friend wants to continue the friendship. The author, however, is avoiding and ignoring the friend because they can't see how the friendship can continue without pain. The author thinks there's no going back to how things were before the confession.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. The question is whether the author is wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nSo, what are the key points here? The author had a friendship, developed feelings, asked the friend out, got rejected. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship, but the author is ghosting them. The author's reasoning is that being around the friend is painful now because their feelings haven't changed.\n\nNow, considering social norms and empathy. When someone confesses their feelings and is rejected, it's common for the friendship to be affected. The friend wants to continue the relationship, which is a common response to not wanting to lose a friend. However, the person who confessed might find it difficult to be friends, which is a valid emotional response. Ghosting, though, is cutting off communication without explanation. \n\nIs that wrong? Well, ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person wondering why they're being ignored. The author could have communicated their need for space or explained their feelings, but instead chose to ignore the friend. That lack of communication is a problem. Even if the author can't be friends, being dismissive without explanation is hurtful. The friend might be confused or think they did something wrong, even though they're trying to be understanding.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is dealing with emotional pain. It's tough to maintain a friendship after a rejection, especially if the feelings are still strong. The author might feel that being friends is a bad idea for their own well-being. However, the appropriate action would be to have an honest conversation, even if it's difficult. Ghosting skips that step, which is why it's seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong for not communicating their feelings and instead choosing to ghost. The right thing to do would have been to explain that they can't continue the friendship and need space, even if it's uncomfortable. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
