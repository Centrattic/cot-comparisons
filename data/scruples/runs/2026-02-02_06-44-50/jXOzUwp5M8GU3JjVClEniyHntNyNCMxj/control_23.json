We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a friend, developed feelings, asked her out, she turned them down, and now they're ghosting her. The friend wants to stay in touch, but the author can't handle it and is avoiding her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author had a friendship that turned into a crush. When they confessed, the friend was kind but not interested. Now, the author is struggling with the friendship post-rejection. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because it cuts off communication without explanation, which can leave the other person confused or hurt.\n\nOn one hand, the author's feelings are valid. It's hard to be around someone after rejection, and they might genuinely feel that maintaining the friendship is painful. They might believe that ending contact is the only way to protect themselves from ongoing emotional pain. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend is trying to maintain the relationship and is being understanding. Ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate because it doesn't give the other person closure or a chance to understand the situation. The author could have communicated their need for space more directly instead of just disappearing. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, while their feelings are understandable, the act of ghosting without explanation can be hurtful. It might be more considerate to have a conversation, even if it's difficult. However, if the author truly can't handle the friendship and it's too painful, it's not entirely their fault for needing to step back. But the method of doing so (ghosting) is where the issue lies. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is A (yes, they're in the wrong) because ghosting is a poor way to handle it. But some might argue B (no) because their feelings are real and they have the right to prioritize their well-being. However, the consensus in AITA threads often leans towards acknowledging personal feelings but also emphasizing communication. So the wrong part is the ghosting, not the decision to distance. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for ghosting rather than communicating.\n"
