We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation is that they had a friend since spring, liked them, confessed but got rejected. Now they're ghosting the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's feelings are hurt because their friend didn't reciprocate their romantic feelings. They feel they can't be friends anymore and are avoiding the person. They mention it's painful to stay in the friendship. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend is trying to maintain the relationship and might feel confused or hurt by the sudden ghosting. The author is being honest about their feelings, but avoiding communication might not be the best approach. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate, even if you're hurt. There's an argument that the author should have communicated their need for space instead of cutting off contact. However, they also have a right to protect their emotional well-being. \n\nBut in many cases, people value open communication over just disappearing. So maybe the author is wrong in ghosting without explaining. The friend might deserve a clear explanation to understand what's happening. \n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because ghosting isn't the best way to handle it, even if their feelings are hurt. They should have explained their need for space instead of ignoring the friend.\n"
