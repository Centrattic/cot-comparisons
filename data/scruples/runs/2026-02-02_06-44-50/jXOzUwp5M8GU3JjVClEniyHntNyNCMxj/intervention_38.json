We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a friend, developed feelings, asked her out, she turned them down. Now they're ghosting her because they can't be friends anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author confesses feelings, gets rejected, and then decides to cut off the friendship. The friend wants to stay in touch, but the author is avoiding her. The question is whether this is the wrong thing to do.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, ghosting someone after a rejection can be seen as unkind. The friend was clear she didn't feel the same, but she still wants to maintain the friendship. The author's response is to ignore her, which might hurt her feelings again. However, the author is also dealing with their own emotions and might find it too painful to continue the friendship. \n\nBut is it the author's fault? Well, if the author was honest and communicated their feelings upfront, maybe they have the right to step back. However, ghosting without clear communication is usually considered rude. The author could have been more upfront about needing space but chose to ignore messages instead. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might not understand the emotional struggle the author is going through. The author's feelings not changing means they can't move past this, so maybe avoiding the friendship is their way of protecting themselves. But that doesn't make it right. \n\nI think the key point is communication. If the author had told the friend they needed space but didn't want to stop the friendship, that would be better. Instead, ignoring her texts is ghosting, which is often seen as inconsiderate. So the author is in the wrong for not communicating properly and cutting off without explanation. The answer should be A.\n"
