      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been friends since spring, had a good connection. The author developed feelings, confessed them, and the friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. Now the author is avoiding the friend, ignoring texts. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author finds it painful and can't see going back to the old dynamic. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about emotional boundaries and how to handle rejection. When someone confesses their feelings and gets rejected, it's natural to feel hurt. The author is choosing to ghost rather than confront the ongoing discomfort. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship, but the author isn't able to move past the rejection.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is the author wrong? Well, they didn't do anything malicious. They're honest about their feelings not changing and are avoiding the friend because it's painful. Ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate, but in this context, maybe it's a self-preservation tactic. The friend initiated the contact, so the author isn't necessarily at fault for not responding. However, some might argue that communication is better than ghosting. But the author's intention is clear: they can't be friends anymore because it's too painful. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend is trying to salvage the friendship, so the author's ghosting might hurt the friend further. But the author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship that's causing them emotional distress. It's a tough spot. The author isn't doing it out of spite; they're trying to protect their own feelings. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think it's a nuanced situation. They didn't act out of malice, but ghosting can be seen as a lack of communication. However, given their emotional state and the fact that the friend is pushing for contact while the author can't handle it, maybe it's understandable. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're acting based on their own emotional needs, even if it's hurtful.\n"
