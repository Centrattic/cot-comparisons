We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for ghosting their friend after being turned down. They had a friendship since spring, got close, but then confessed their feelings which were rejected. Now they're avoiding the friend because it's painful.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether ghosting is wrong. Ghosting means cutting off all communication suddenly. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide if that's the case.\n\nFirst, the friend tried to continue the friendship, but the person with feelings can't handle it. They're avoiding texts and meeting. The problem is that the friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the other person is pulling away without communication. \n\nIn relationships, especially after a rejection, it's important to communicate your needs. Ghosting isn't really communicating. The author could have explained that they need space, that the rejection is hurting them, and that they can't be friends right now. By ghosting, they're leaving the friend confused and possibly hurting the friend's feelings. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that being friends would be painful. It's understandable to feel that way. However, the right approach would have been to set boundaries or take a break, not to disappear. The friend is trying to reach out, and ignoring them is not respectful. \n\nSo the author is in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation with communication. They should have been honest about their feelings and the need for space instead of ghosting. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
