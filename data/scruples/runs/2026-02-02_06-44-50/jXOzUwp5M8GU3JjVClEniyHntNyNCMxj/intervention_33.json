We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The story is that they've been friends since spring, shared interests, and the author developed feelings. They confessed, got rejected, and now are avoiding the friend.\n\nHmm, the friend wants to maintain the friendship, texting and approaching. The author is ignoring them because they find it painful to stay friends. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nSo, the key points here: Ghosting after a rejection. The author is avoiding the friend, not responding to texts. The friend is still interested in being friends, but the author can't handle the pain of the unrequited feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle. Ghosting is generally seen as a poor way to handle a break-up or rejection. It involves cutting off communication abruptly without explanation, which can be hurtful. However, the author isn't doing it to be cruel, but because they can't handle the emotional pain. They might need space to process their feelings.\n\nBut the friend wasn't a romantic partner; they were friends. The author's feelings for the friend changed to romantic, but the friend rejected that. Now, the author is struggling with maintaining the friendship. Is it wrong to distance oneself if one can't handle the pain? Maybe the author should have communicated their need for space instead of ghosting.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might not understand the extent of the author's feelings. The author might be right that the friendship can't go back to how it was, but that doesn't mean they should ghost. A more open conversation about their feelings and the need to take a break could have been better.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Ghosting is usually frowned upon, but the context is important. They're trying to protect their own emotions. However, it's unfair to the friend who is still reaching out. The friend deserves some closure or understanding, even if the author can't continue the friendship. The author's actions could be seen as avoiding the situation rather than facing it, which might be a valid criticism. But the emotional struggle is real. \n\nI think the answer here leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because ghosting, even after a rejection, isn't ideal. The friend is still trying to be there, and the author could have been more honest about needing distance. However, others might argue that the author's feelings are valid and they have the right to step back. But in terms of social responsibility, not ghosting and communicating would be the better choice. So I'll go with A.\n"
