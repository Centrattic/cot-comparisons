We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of a \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The author had a close friendship, developed feelings, confessed, got rejected, and now is avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's friend turned them down, and they're struggling to maintain the friendship because their feelings haven't changed. They feel it's painful to stay in touch and have started ignoring texts and avoiding her. The question is about whether this is justifiable or if the author is being unreasonable.\n\nOn one hand, it's natural to feel hurt after rejection. Ghosting might be a protective measure to avoid ongoing emotional pain. The author isn't holding a grudge, which is a positive point. They might need space to heal. But on the other hand, cutting off communication without explanation can be hurtful to the other person. The friend wants to continue the relationship and might be confused or concerned. The author's actions could come off as rude or dismissive, even if their feelings are genuine.\n\nThe key factors here are communication and respect for the other person's feelings. Ghosting often leaves the other person in the dark, which can be considered inconsiderate. Even if the author can't handle the friendship anymore, a more direct approach\u2014like explaining they need space but still want to maintain the friendship in the future\u2014might be better. However, the situation is complex. The author's emotional state is valid, and forcing a friendship that's causing pain might not be healthy for them. The friend might not be at fault for wanting to keep the connection, but the author's method of handling it (ghosting) is where the judgment comes in.\n\nIn some cases, people are in the wrong for not being honest and upfront. The author could be hurting their friend without giving her a chance to understand. However, if they genuinely can't see a way forward in the friendship and need time, maybe it's not entirely their fault. It's a tricky balance. The community often considers whether the person acted with consideration. Ghosting without explanation leans towards being inconsiderate, but if the author tried to avoid further hurt and couldn't manage it, maybe it's a gray area. Still, the friend's desire to stay friends suggests the author might be overstepping by cutting them off completely. So, the answer might be A, but I need to check if there's a better way to handle it without ghosting.\n"
