We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. The situation is that they had a close friendship, developed feelings, confessed them, and were rejected. Now the friend wants to continue the friendship, but the author is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the situation. The author had feelings for their friend, which is understandable. They must have felt vulnerable opening up, and the friend was kind but didn't reciprocate. The author is struggling with the residual feelings and the idea of maintaining the friendship. They chose to ghost, which means cutting off communication without explanation.\n\nNow, the question is whether this makes them wrong. On one hand, ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. The friend is trying to reach out and maintain a connection, so suddenly disappearing might be hurtful. The author's reasoning is that remaining friends is painful because their feelings haven't changed. But is it fair to expect the friend to just drop the relationship? The friend might value the connection and want to work through it.\n\nHowever, the author is also in a difficult emotional state. They might not be ready to be friends again, especially if being around the person is painful. It's possible that they need time to heal. But instead of cutting off abruptly, maybe a more direct approach would be better, like explaining that they need space. Ghosting without communication could indeed be seen as selfish or rude, even if their intentions are to protect their own feelings.\n\nAnother angle: the friend doesn't owe the author their reciprocation. It's reasonable for the author to feel hurt, but the friend's desire to continue the friendship is valid. The author's decision to ghost might prevent the friend from understanding the situation, leading to resentment or confusion. The right approach might be to be honest about needing time or space, rather than just disappearing.\n\nSo, while the author's feelings are valid, the act of ghosting without explanation is likely the wrong move. They should be in the wrong for not communicating their need for space, which is a more respectful approach. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
