We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The situation is that they had a close friendship, they confessed their feelings, got rejected, and now they're avoiding the friend to avoid the pain of not being able to be friends anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around this. Ghosting usually has a negative connotation because it's about cutting off contact without explanation, which can be hurtful. But the user's reasoning is that they can't handle the emotional pain of continuing the friendship. The friend wants to stay in touch, but the user is struggling with their feelings. \n\nIs it wrong to prioritize their own emotional well-being? On one hand, the friend tried to be understanding and wants to maintain the relationship. On the other, the user is finding it too painful to keep being friends. The user might be in a tough spot where they can't move past their emotions, so ghosting is a way to protect themselves. But is it fair to the friend? Ghosting without any communication can leave the friend confused and feeling rejected again, even if it's just as a friend.\n\nThe key points here are that the user was honest about their feelings, the friend turned them down, and now the user is avoiding contact to avoid the pain. The user isn't being malicious; they just can't handle the situation. However, the friend might need closure or understanding. Ghosting in this case might be seen as selfish, even if the user is hurting. Maybe a better approach would be to explain their need for space, rather than just cutting off. \n\nBut the question is whether they're in the wrong. In many AITA scenarios, ghosting is frowned upon unless there are extenuating circumstances. Since the user's issue is emotional difficulty rather than something like abuse, they might be considered in the wrong for not communicating and ending the friendship properly. However, there's also empathy for their situation because it's hard to deal with rejection and maintain the friendship. \n\nSo the answer might be that they're not in the wrong (B) because they have a valid reason for their feelings, but the right thing to do would be to communicate and set boundaries. But strictly based on whether they are the asshole, maybe B because it's understandable, even if not ideal. Alternatively, some might argue that they should have handled it better, so maybe A. \n\nWait, the user is avoiding the friend after being rejected. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship, but the user is struggling. Ghosting without any explanation can be hurtful, even if the user isn't in a malicious place. The friend might feel like they did something wrong again. The right thing would be to tell the friend that they need space but still value the friendship. So maybe the user is in the wrong for not being honest and just disappearing. But the user's reasoning is that they can't be friends anymore. So is that a valid reason? It's possible, but the method of handling it (ghosting) is the issue. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, they're in the wrong) because of the lack of communication, even if their feelings are genuine.\n"
