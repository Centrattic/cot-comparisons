      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting a friend after being rejected.\n\nSo the person had a friend they liked for a while. They confessed their feelings, got rejected, and now they're ignoring the friend. The friend still wants to stay in touch, but the author can't handle the pain of the friendship continuing. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author had feelings, took a chance, and got rejected. That's tough. The friend was nice and didn't want to end the friendship. But the author is struggling with the pain of being around someone they still have feelings for. Ghosting is generally considered rude, but maybe there's some context here. \n\nIs the author's behavior justified? They might be avoiding pain, which is understandable. But ghosting without communication could hurt the friend. The author says they don't hold the friend's rejection against her, but the friendship is now strained. The friend is reaching out, and the author is avoiding them. \n\nThe key points here are communication and empathy. Ghosting is usually seen as bad because it leaves the other person confused. However, the author's reason is that they can't be friends anymore. Maybe they should have communicated that instead of just ignoring messages. But on the other hand, dealing with unrequited feelings is hard, and sometimes people need space.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often get called out for not communicating their feelings properly. Here, the author did confess their feelings. The problem is after the rejection. The author's choice to ghost might be seen as inconsiderate, even if they're hurting. But they might not be in the wrong because they're protecting their own emotions. \n\nI think the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author was honest about their feelings upfront. But some might argue that ignoring the friend without explanation is wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. However, in AITA discussions, people are usually expected to communicate their decision to distance themselves rather than ghost. So maybe the author is in the wrong (A) because they didn't explain their actions. But if the author can't handle the friendship, maybe it's understandable. \n\nWait, the friend wants to continue the friendship. The author is avoiding them because the friendship is painful. The author might need to cut contact for their own well-being, but doing it without communication is bad. So the right approach would be to explain their need for space. Since they didn't, they might be in the wrong. But the initial confession was honest. \n\nHmm. Maybe the answer is B. Because the author's feelings are valid, and they have the right to protect their emotions. But the method of ghosting is poor. However, in AITA, sometimes people are given some leeway if their actions stem from genuine emotional pain. So maybe B is the answer here.\n"
