We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting a friend after being turned down. The situation is that the author had a friend they liked, confessed their feelings, got rejected, and now is avoiding the friend. The question is whether they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of relationships and friendship. When someone confesses their feelings and gets rejected, it's natural to feel hurt. The author says they still have feelings, so continuing the friendship might be painful for them. But ghosting, which is abruptly cutting off all communication, is generally seen as inconsiderate. \n\nThe friend wants to maintain the relationship, but the author is struggling with the emotional aspect. The key here is whether the author should have communicated their decision more clearly instead of just disappearing. Ghosting can leave the other person confused and hurt, even if the author is the one who was rejected. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be protecting themselves from further pain. But in social interactions, communication is key. If the author couldn't handle being around the friend, they might have needed to have an honest conversation about their feelings and the need for space, rather than ghosting. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't act out of malice, but they didn't handle it respectfully. By ghosting, they didn't give the friend a chance to understand or adjust. The right approach would be to explain their feelings and the need for distance, even if it's uncomfortable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate their boundaries properly and instead chose to disappear, which is disrespectful to the friend.\n"
