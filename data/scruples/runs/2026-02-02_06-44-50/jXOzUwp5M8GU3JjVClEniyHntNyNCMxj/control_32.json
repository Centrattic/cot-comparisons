      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. They had a friend since spring, got along well, had similar interests. Then they developed feelings for her but were too scared to act. They finally confessed, but she didn't reciprocate. Now they're ghosting her because they feel the friendship can't go back to normal and it's painful to stay friends. She wants to keep being friends, texting and approaching, but he's avoiding her.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. The main issue here is whether ghosting is the right move after a rejected romantic confession. The person is avoiding the friend because they can't handle the pain of being in the friendship anymore. They don't hold any grudge, but they just can't go back to how things were. \n\nFirst, is it wrong to ghost someone after they rejected your romantic feelings? Well, ghosting is generally considered inconsiderate because you're cutting off communication without explanation. However, in this case, the author is dealing with emotional pain. They might not be ready to have a conversation about why they can't continue the friendship. But avoiding all communication could be hurtful to the other person. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author is choosing to disappear.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to their feelings and might need space. On the other, the friend is trying to salvage the friendship, and ghosting could leave her confused or feeling rejected again. Maybe the right approach would be to explain that they need some space and can't continue the friendship, even if they respect her decision. That way, the friend isn't left hanging. \n\nSo is the author in the wrong? Well, they aren't being inconsiderate out of malice, but their method of handling it (ghosting) is inconsiderate. They might be right in needing space and not being able to maintain the friendship, but the way they're doing it is wrong. Alternatively, if they can't handle the friendship anymore, they should communicate that clearly instead of ghosting. \n\nI think the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because ghosting is generally seen as poor communication, even if the emotions are valid. The better approach would be to have an honest conversation, even if it's difficult. So the answer might be A. But maybe some would argue that the author is not in the wrong because they can't force themselves to be friends and need to protect their feelings. However, the act of ghosting is still considered inconsiderate regardless of the reason. So I think A is the answer here.\n"
