We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting a friend after being rejected.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author had a friendship, developed feelings, confessed them, got rejected, and now is avoiding the friend. The friend still wants to be friends, but the author can't handle the pain and is ghosting.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for doing this. Let's break it down. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author is cutting them off. However, the author's reasoning is that being friends would be painful since their feelings haven't changed. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to their feelings and need space. But on the other hand, ghosting can be hurtful. The key here is communication. Instead of ignoring texts, maybe having an honest conversation about needing space would be better. The author isn't being malicious; they're just avoiding discomfort. But the friend might feel abandoned. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and impact. The author's intent isn't to be cruel but to protect their own emotions. However, the impact is that the friend is left confused and hurt. The right approach would be to explain the situation rather than ghost. So the author is in the wrong for not communicating properly, even if their feelings are valid. They should address it directly instead of avoiding.\n"
