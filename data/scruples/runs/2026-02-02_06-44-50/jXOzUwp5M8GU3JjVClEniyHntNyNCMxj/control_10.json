      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the letter is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author had a friend they've known since spring, and they shared a lot of common interests. They developed feelings for this friend but were too scared to act. Then they confessed, but the friend turned them down. The author says they don't hold it against her and want to continue being friends, but they can't go back to how things were. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship by texting and approaching, but the author is ignoring her and avoiding her, which is considered ghosting.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Ghosting typically means cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The author is avoiding the friend because they find it painful to remain in the friendship after rejection. They might be struggling with their emotions and not ready to be just friends. \n\nBut is that the friend's fault? The friend was honest about not having feelings and is trying to maintain the friendship. The author's actions are affecting the friend's attempts to stay in touch. On one hand, the author has the right to their emotions and might need space. On the other, ghosting can be hurtful, even if the feelings aren't mutual. The author could be seen as being selfish by not communicating their need for distance, which could make the friend feel confused or rejected again. \n\nHowever, the author isn't forcing the friendship; they're just not responding. If the friend keeps trying, maybe the author should have a conversation to explain that they need time. But the author's choice to ghost might be a way to protect themselves emotionally. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a judgment call. Some might say yes because ghosting is rude and the friend is trying to move past it. Others might say no, as the author is dealing with painful emotions and has the right to prioritize their well-being. The key points are honesty in communication and mutual respect. Ghosting without explanation isn't ideal, but the situation's context (post-rejection pain) complicates it. I think the answer is B (No), because the author is not obligated to maintain the friendship if it's causing them pain, but they should communicate their reasons. However, since they're avoiding and not responding, technically they are ghosting, which is usually frowned upon. Hmm, but maybe in this case, it's more about unrequited feelings and not the friend's fault. The friend is trying to stay in touch, but the author can't handle it. So, the author isn't in the wrong for needing space, but the method (ghosting) might be. But the question is whether they're in the wrong overall. I'm leaning towards B because the author's actions are a personal choice to protect their feelings, though better communication would have been better. So the answer is B.\n"
