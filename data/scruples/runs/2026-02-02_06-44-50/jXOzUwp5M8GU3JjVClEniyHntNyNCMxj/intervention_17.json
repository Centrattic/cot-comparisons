We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting a friend after being turned down. The situation is that they had a good friendship, the author developed feelings, confessed, got rejected, and now is avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the perspective here. The author is experiencing emotional pain because their feelings aren't reciprocated. They feel that continuing the friendship would be too painful, so they've chosen to ghost. The friend, on the other hand, wants to stay in touch and is making efforts, but the author is ignoring her.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, so they're looking for a discussion on that. But I need to analyze it objectively. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without explanation or closure. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship as before, but the author's actions are cutting off communication.\n\nHowever, the author might not be in the wrong if they genuinely believe they can't handle the friendship anymore. It's a tough situation where someone's emotional well-being is at stake. But the issue is the method of handling it. Instead of ghosting, a more direct approach might be better, even if it's hard. Ghosting can cause hurt and confusion, even if the friend didn't reciprocate romantic feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's feelings are valid. They might not be ready to be around the friend, and avoiding is a way to protect themselves. But the problem is that it's the friend who's being ghosted, not the one who rejected them. The author should have communicated their need for space or to distance themselves, rather than just cutting off contact.\n\nSo, the key point is communication. Ghosting isn't the right approach here because it's abrupt and doesn't respect the friend's efforts to maintain the relationship. The author should have had a conversation to set boundaries, even if it's uncomfortable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not handling it more respectfully, even if their feelings are understandable.\n"
