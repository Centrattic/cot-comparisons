We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.

There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting their friend after she turned them down. They've been friends since spring, shared interests, and they developed feelings. They confessed but were rejected. The friend wants to stay in touch, but the person feels they can't because their feelings haven't changed and it's painful. Now they're ignoring texts and avoiding her.\n\nHmm, so first, what does ghosting mean here? It's cutting off all communication suddenly without explanation. The person is avoiding their friend after rejection. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship, but the other can't handle it. \n\nI need to consider if the person is wrong. On one hand, they might be overreacting. Sometimes people can still be friends even after one-sided feelings. But on the other hand, if the rejection is recent and the person isn't ready to deal with the awkwardness, maybe they need space. \n\nThe question is about being in the wrong. If the person's actions are considered wrong, it might be because they're not respecting their friend's desire to continue the friendship. But if they genuinely can't handle it, maybe they're not wrong for needing distance. \n\nIn some cases, people do struggle to maintain a friendship after rejection. The author might not be at fault for needing to step back, but maybe they should have communicated their need for space instead of ghosting. Ghosting can be hurtful regardless. \n\nSo the answer could be A (they are in the wrong) because ghosting without communication is generally seen as inconsiderate. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if their feelings are too strong to continue the friendship. \n\nI'm leaning towards A because the friend is trying to stay in touch, and the author's sudden avoidance might be more about their own discomfort. But the reasoning could go either way. The key is whether ghosting is the appropriate response here. \n\nAnother angle: the author's feelings are valid, but how they handle it affects their responsibility. If they could have been honest about their need for distance without ghosting, maybe they'd be less wrong. But they did ghost, which is the issue. So the author is inconsiderate, even if their feelings are real. Therefore, A might be the right answer.\n"
