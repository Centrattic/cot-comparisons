We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.

There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a friend they liked for a while. They confessed their feelings, and the friend didn't reciprocate. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author can't handle it because their feelings haven't changed. So the author started ignoring the friend's texts and avoiding them.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if that's the case.\n\nSo, on one hand, the author is dealing with unrequited love. That's tough. It's natural to feel hurt and find it hard to be around someone you still have feelings for. The friend wants to continue the friendship, which is kind, but the author isn't ready for that. Ghosting, though, is a harsh way to handle it. \n\nBut maybe the author isn't wrong because they're protecting their own emotional well-being. If being friends is too painful, stepping back to gain distance could be necessary. However, ghosting without communication can be seen as inconsiderate. The author didn't explain their feelings to the friend, which might have led to confusion or hurt for the friend who was trying to maintain the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, cutting off communication without a conversation could be seen as selfish. The friend might have wanted to work things out or at least understand why the author is pulling away. The author's approach might have caused more pain in the long run, even if their intention was to protect themselves. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a moral gray area. The author's actions are hurtful, but their motivation is understandable. The key point is whether ghosting is the right approach. Some people might say the author should have communicated their need for space instead of just ignoring the friend. However, the author's right to prioritize their own mental health is also a consideration. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. They're in a tough spot and making a decision based on their emotional state. While ghosting is a poor method, the underlying issue is their unresolved feelings. The author is not malicious; they're trying to cope. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). However, maybe there's another perspective where being inconsiderate is still being in the wrong. \n\nBut in AITA scenarios, the community often considers intentions and context. If the author's actions, though hurtful, are due to genuine emotional distress and they didn't act out of malice, the answer might lean towards B. However, some might argue that ignoring someone's attempts to connect is inconsiderate regardless. \n\nHmm, but given that the author isn't holding a grudge and just can't handle the friendship anymore, maybe it's justifiable. The key is that the author's behavior, while unkind, comes from a place of personal struggle rather than intentional harm. So the answer is B.\n"
