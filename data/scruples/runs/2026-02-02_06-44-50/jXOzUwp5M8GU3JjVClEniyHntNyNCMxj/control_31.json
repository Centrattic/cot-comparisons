We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they had a friend they really liked, got feelings for her, confessed, but she didn't reciprocate. Now they're ghosting her because they can't be friends anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of both parties. The author says they don't hold anything against their friend and it's not her fault. But they're struggling with their feelings, and being around her is painful. They're choosing to ghost, which is cutting off communication without explanation. \n\nNow, the question is whether that's wrong. On one hand, ghosting is generally seen as rude because you're just disappearing without giving a reason. The friend might be confused or hurt by the sudden silence, especially since she wanted to maintain the friendship. The author is avoiding the situation instead of having a conversation to manage expectations.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is dealing with emotional pain and might think that distance is necessary for their own well-being. They might not want to keep pretending to be friends when it's hard for them. But even so, being honest about needing space, even if it's hard, is usually better than just ghosting. \n\nAlso, the fact that they were upfront about their feelings shows they were honest initially. But after the rejection, maybe they should have communicated their need for distance respectfully rather than ghosting. Ghosting can leave the other person feeling rejected again, even if it's not their fault. \n\nSo, while the author's feelings are valid, the method they're using to handle the situation (ghosting) is probably not the right approach. They should have explained their need for space to avoid hurting their friend again. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they're avoiding communication instead of being honest about their needs.\n"
