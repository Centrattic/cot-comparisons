We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The scenario is that they had a good friendship, developed feelings, confessed, got rejected, and now are avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of friendships and romantic feelings. When someone confesses their feelings and gets rejected, it's natural to feel hurt. The author mentions that they can't go back to how things were, which is a common reaction. The friend wants to continue the friendship, but the author is finding it painful to stay in touch. \n\nGhosting is generally seen as cutting off communication without explanation. The author is ignoring texts and avoiding the friend. The key here is whether this is a reasonable response. On one hand, the author might be protecting their emotions by stepping back. On the other hand, ghosting can be hurtful to the other person, who might not understand why the author is pulling away.\n\nThe friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author isn't able to. The author isn't being intentionally cruel, but they're not communicating their reasons either. In healthy relationships, communication is key. By ghosting, the author isn't giving the friend a chance to understand or adjust. \n\nHowever, sometimes people need space after a rejection. If the author can't handle being friends anymore, it's valid to take a step back. But doing so without explanation might leave the friend confused. The right approach might have been to explain that they need some distance but not necessarily cut off completely. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're not necessarily in the wrong for needing space, but the method of ghosting without explanation is problematic. The friend might feel rejected again, thinking they did something wrong. The author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate, even if their intentions are to protect themselves. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they're avoiding communication, which can hurt the friend. It's important to be honest about needing space but to do so respectfully.\n"
