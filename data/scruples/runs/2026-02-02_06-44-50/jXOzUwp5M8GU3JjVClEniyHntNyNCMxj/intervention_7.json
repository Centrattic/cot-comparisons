We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting a friend after being rejected. The author had feelings for their friend, confessed, got rejected, and now is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. The author wants to avoid the pain of being around someone they still have feelings for. Ghosting is cutting off communication without explanation. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, they did ask for the friend's opinion, so they might feel they have a right to their feelings. But ghosting can be hurtful because the friend is trying to maintain the relationship and doesn't get closure. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they can't see being friends anymore because their feelings haven't changed. But is it fair to ghost? Maybe a better approach would be to explain that they need space, even if it's hard. Ghosting might leave the friend confused or hurt.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is dealing with their own emotions and trying to protect themselves from pain. It's understandable, but communication is usually better than cutting off completely. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not being honest and instead avoiding contact. \n\nBut if the author's actions are to protect their own feelings, is that their fault? It's a bit of a gray area. The friend might feel abandoned without knowing why. So the author is in the wrong for not being upfront. Answer A.\n"
