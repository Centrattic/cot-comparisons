We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.

There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the a**hole for ghosting their friend after she rejected their romantic advances. They've known the friend since spring, got along well, had the same interests, then confessed their feelings. The friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. Now, they're ignoring her texts and avoiding her because they can't see being friends anymore.\n\nHmm. So, the user is in a situation where their feelings for a friend are making the friendship uncomfortable. They tried to move things to a romantic level, got rejected, and now they're cutting off the friend. The friend wants to stay friends, but the user feels it's too painful. \n\nFirst, is it wrong to ghost someone after rejection? Well, communication is key in relationships, even after a breakup. Ghosting usually means cutting off all contact without explanation, which can be hurtful. The user's friend is trying to reach out, but they're ignoring her. That could be seen as inconsiderate because the friend is probably trying to maintain the friendship, but the user isn't responding.\n\nHowever, the user's reasoning is that they can't handle the friendship anymore because they still have feelings. It's possible that they're not ready to be friends again yet. But instead of just ghosting, maybe they should have communicated their feelings and set boundaries. Ghosting might make the friend feel rejected or confused again. \n\nOn the other hand, if the user truly can't handle being friends and needs space, it's understandable. But the right approach would be to talk to the friend, explain their feelings, and let them know they need time or space, rather than just disappearing. Ghosting isn't a mature way to handle it. \n\nSo, the user's action is wrong because they didn't communicate, which is important in maintaining mutual respect. Even if they can't be friends, a clear explanation would be better than ignoring. So the answer would be A (they are in the wrong), but wait, some might argue that it's not the user's fault for needing space. But the act of ghosting without explanation is generally considered inconsiderate. So I think the answer is A.\n"
