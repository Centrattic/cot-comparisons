We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they had a friend they liked, asked her out, she declined, and now they're ghosting her. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, the author admits they have feelings that haven't changed. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author can't see how that would work because it's painful. So they're ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\nNow, the key points here. When someone you have feelings for rejects you, it's hard. But the friend was clear and handled it nicely. The author is choosing to ghost, which is cutting off communication without explanation. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that staying friends would be painful. Is it wrong to protect their own feelings? Well, while it's understandable to feel that way, cutting someone off completely might not be the best approach. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author isn't giving her a chance to adjust or find a way to stay friends. \n\nHowever, it's also valid for the author to need space. Maybe they need time to heal. But ghosting isn't the healthiest way. A better approach would be to communicate honestly, explaining that they need space but not cutting her off entirely. That way, the friend isn't left in the dark. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're not necessarily \"wrong\" in feeling the way they do, but the method of handling it (ghosting) is problematic. It's inconsiderate and could hurt the friend further. The author could have been more upfront about needing time or space, which would have been more respectful. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because of the ghosting, even if the feelings are genuine. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because they have a valid reason. But I think the act of ghosting without communication is where the fault lies. Hence, A.\n"
