We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. The situation is that they had a close friendship since spring, developed feelings, confessed, but the friend didn't reciprocate. Now, the friend wants to stay friends, but the author is ignoring her texts and avoiding her because it's painful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's considered acceptable in such situations. Ghosting generally means cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The author is avoiding the friend and not responding to texts, which is a form of ghosting. But why are they doing it? They're doing it because they can't see how the friendship can continue after confessing their feelings. They're still in love, and the friendship is now painful.\n\nOn one hand, the friend wants to maintain the relationship, which is understandable. Rejection can be tough, but wanting to remain friends is common. However, the author is struggling to move past the emotional pain. They might need space or might not be able to handle the friendship anymore. Is it their fault for not wanting to continue a friendship that's causing them emotional distress?\n\nI think it's important to note that the author's actions are causing hurt to the friend. The friend is trying to reach out, and the author is ignoring them. Even if the author is in pain, cutting off communication without explanation can be harsh. But maybe the author is being honest with their feelings. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nHowever, the key point is that the author has the right to prioritize their emotional well-being. If the friendship is no longer healthy for them, they aren't necessarily wrong for stepping away. But the way they're doing it (ghosting) is problematic. The correct approach would be to communicate their feelings to the friend and explain why they need space, rather than just disappearing. \n\nSo the author might not be in the wrong for wanting to end the friendship due to unrequited feelings, but they are in the wrong for ghosting instead of having an open conversation. The question is whether the act of ghosting is the wrong part. The answer here is likely that the author is in the wrong for not communicating properly, even if their feelings are valid. So the answer should be A.\n"
