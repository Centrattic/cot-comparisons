We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about someone who had a friend they liked, confessed their feelings, got rejected, and then started ghosting their friend. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's perspective: They developed feelings for a friend, confessed, and were rejected. They don't hold it against the friend but feel that the friendship can't go back to how it was. The friend wants to continue the friendship, but the author is avoiding them, leading to ghosting. The author argues that staying friends would be painful and they can't move past their feelings.\n\nNow, considering the friend's side: The friend was rejected but is still trying to maintain the friendship. They might feel confused or hurt by being ghosted because they didn't get a clear response. Ghosting could be seen as inconsiderate since the friend is making an effort to reconnect, but the author isn't responding.\n\nThe key points here are communication and respect. The author might be right in feeling that they can't handle being in a friendship where they still have feelings. However, ghosting is often seen as a lack of communication, which can be hurtful. A better approach might have been to have an open conversation about why they can't continue the friendship and give the friend a chance to understand, even if the author isn't ready to be friends. \n\nGhosting without explanation can leave the other person in the dark, which is unfair. The author is avoiding discomfort, but that doesn't justify not being honest. The friend might appreciate knowing the truth, even if it's hard to hear. So, while the author's feelings are valid, their method of handling it by ghosting could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not communicating clearly and for avoiding the friend without explaining their reasons.\n"
