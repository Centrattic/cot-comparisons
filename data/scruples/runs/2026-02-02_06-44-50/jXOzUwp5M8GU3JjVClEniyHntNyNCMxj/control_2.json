      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully. \n\nThe user is asking for advice about whether they are the asshole (AITA) for ghosting their friend after she rejected them. The context is that they've been friends since spring, shared a lot of common interests, and they developed feelings for her. They confessed their feelings and asked her out, but she turned them down. Now, she wants to stay friends and texts them, but they're ignoring her and avoiding her. The user feels that their feelings haven't changed and being in the friendship would be painful.\n\nFirst, I should consider the norms around relationships and friendships. Ghosting, in general, is often seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure. But the user is in a situation where they can't see how the friendship can continue after the rejection. They might be struggling with unrequited feelings and the emotional pain of continuing the friendship. \n\nThe key points here are: the user was honest about their feelings, the friend was nice but didn't reciprocate, and the user is now avoiding the friend. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the user can't handle it. \n\nI should think about whether the user has a right to step back. If the user is genuinely unable to manage their emotions and maintain a friendship, maybe it's not their fault. They might be protecting themselves. However, ignoring the friend's attempts to communicate could be seen as dismissive. \n\nIn some cases, people need time to adjust after a rejection, and it's okay to take space. But the user is completely ghosting, not explaining their actions. That could hurt the friend, even if the user's intention is to avoid pain. \n\nOn the other hand, if the user is convinced that the friendship is unmanageable, they might not be in the wrong. But it's possible that they could communicate their need for distance instead of ghosting. Maybe the issue here is that ghosting is the problem, not necessarily the desire to avoid the friendship. \n\nSo, the user isn't wrong for feeling hurt or needing space, but the act of ghosting without explanation might be. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they were honest about their feelings and then need to step back, but don't communicate that, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nBut the user might not be in the wrong because they're dealing with their own emotions. Ghosting is usually considered bad, but if the friend was already aware of the user's feelings and the rejection, maybe the user isn't obligated to keep the friendship. However, cutting off all communication without explanation is typically seen as rude. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the user communicated their need for space. Since they didn't, even though their feelings are genuine, they might be in the wrong. But the initial act of confessing and then needing time is understandable. Maybe the right approach is to take time but not ghost. However, the user is avoiding the friend entirely, so they might be in the wrong for not handling it more maturely.\n"
