We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after the friend turned them down. The situation is that they had a good friendship, confessed feelings, got rejected, and now they're avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they had feelings, confessed, were rejected, and now the friendship is hard to maintain because the feelings haven't changed. They find it painful to remain friends and chose to ghost to avoid the pain. On the other hand, the friend wants to continue the friendship, which is a common reaction after a rejection. Ghosting might be seen as immature or inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and can hurt them further.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author is struggling to maintain the friendship, it's more respectful to have an open conversation rather than cutting off suddenly. Ghosting can be harmful and may damage trust. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't communicate their feelings about the friendship anymore. It's understandable to feel hurt, but the right approach is to explain why they need space, even if it's difficult. The fact that the author is okay with the friend and doesn't hold a grudge is a positive, but the method of handling the situation (ghosting) is questionable.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the author isn't in the wrong because dealing with unrequited love is tough, and they might not be ready to handle the friendship. However, the friend deserves a clear explanation to move forward. Ghosting without closure can be seen as selfish. So, the author's actions, while understandable emotionally, are inconsiderate. The answer might lean towards A (in the wrong) because they didn't communicate properly. But some might argue that the author is protecting their own emotions and that the friend didn't reciprocate, so it's B (not in the wrong). I need to balance both perspectives but the key issue is the lack of communication. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
