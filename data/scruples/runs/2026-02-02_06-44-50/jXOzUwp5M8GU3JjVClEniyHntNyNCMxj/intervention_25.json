      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting a friend after she turned them down. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, they had a friend since spring, got along well, shared interests. Then the author developed feelings but was too scared to act. They confessed their feelings and asked the friend out. The friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. The author doesn't hold it against her, but they feel like things can't go back to normal. The friend wants to stay friends and tries to reach out, but the author is ignoring her texts and avoiding her because they still have feelings, and it's painful. The author is ghosting her now.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong by ghosting. Let's think about the dynamics here. The friend was clear in turning them down, but the friend still wants to maintain the friendship. The author is struggling with their emotions and can't see how they can remain friends, leading them to avoid the friend. Ghosting usually refers to cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The author is doing that by ignoring texts and avoiding her.\n\nIs the author being inconsiderate? They might feel hurt and need space, but ghosting isn't the healthiest way to handle it. The friend wants to continue the friendship, but the author is choosing to disappear. That can be hurtful to the other person who is trying to maintain the relationship. However, the author's feelings are real, and they might not be ready to be friends. But instead of ghosting, maybe they should have communicated that they need space or that they can't continue the friendship right now. Ghosting is often seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be dealing with emotional pain and not ready to face the friend. Maybe they feel that staying friends would make things more difficult. But the friend was trying to be understanding and wanted to continue the friendship. The author's actions could be seen as rejecting the friend's attempts to maintain the relationship without giving an explanation. That could be considered wrong because it's a unilateral decision without regard for the friend's feelings. \n\nBut maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're honestly dealing with their emotions and can't handle the friendship anymore. They might need to step back, but they should have communicated that rather than ghosting. So the act of ghosting is what's problematic, not necessarily the desire to distance. If the author had said, \"I need some space right now,\" that would be better. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate their needs and instead chose to ghost. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that the author isn't in the wrong because they're being honest with themselves and prioritizing their emotional well-being. But ghosting is still rude. So the answer might depend on whether the person's action (ghosting) is considered wrong regardless of their intentions. \n\nIn most cases, ghosting is seen as inconsiderate, so the author is in the wrong. Therefore, answer A.\n"
