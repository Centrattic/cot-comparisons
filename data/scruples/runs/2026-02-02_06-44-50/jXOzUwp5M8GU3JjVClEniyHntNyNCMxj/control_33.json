We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.

There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting a friend after being rejected. The author has known this friend since spring, they got along well, and he developed feelings. He confessed, got turned down, and now he's avoiding her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the friendship. The friend wants to continue the friendship, but the author can't handle being around her anymore because his feelings haven't changed. He's ghosting her now by ignoring texts and avoiding her. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, when someone is rejected, it's common to feel hurt and need space. However, ghosting can be seen as immature or inconsiderate. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author is choosing to cut off communication. \n\nOn one hand, the author is dealing with unrequited feelings, which is tough. It's understandable that he might not want to be friends if it's painful. On the other hand, ghosting without explanation can leave the other person confused and hurt. The friend might be trying to be understanding and give space, but the author isn't communicating his needs clearly. \n\nIn healthy relationships, communication is key. If the author can't handle being friends, it would be better to explain that rather than ghost. Ghosting can be seen as disrespectful because it doesn't give the other person a chance to process or adjust. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of his feelings, but his actions of ignoring and avoiding could be considered wrong because it's not handling the situation with empathy.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not communicating his feelings and is cutting off someone who wants to stay friends. But maybe not entirely, since he's dealing with unrequited love. But in AITA scenarios, people often are criticized for ghosting. So leaning towards A.\n"
