      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after she turned them down. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their friend have been close since last spring, sharing similar interests. The author developed feelings but was too scared to act, so they confessed and asked her out. The friend responded nicely but didn't reciprocate the feelings. The author doesn't hold it against her but feels like their friendship can't go back to how it was. The friend is trying to maintain contact, but the author is ignoring her texts and avoiding her, leading to the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) question.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the author's friend is making an effort to stay in touch, which is understandable because rejection doesn't mean the end of the friendship. On the other hand, the author is struggling with the emotional pain of unrequited feelings and doesn't see a way to continue the friendship without discomfort.\n\nIs it fair to say the author is wrong for ghosting? Well, ghosting usually means cutting off all communication without explanation, which can be hurtful. The friend is reaching out, and the author is ignoring her. Even if the author is hurt, communication is key in any relationship. Instead of just disappearing, the author could have been honest about their feelings and the need for space. That way, the friend isn't left wondering why they're being ignored. \n\nHowever, the author is in a tough spot. They might feel that trying to maintain the friendship would be too painful, and they're not trying to be mean, just avoiding the pain. But the issue is that they're not communicating this. If they can't be friends, a better approach would be to have a conversation, maybe ask for some time alone, or explain their feelings to the friend so she knows it's not personal. \n\nGhosting can make people feel rejected and undervalued, even if the friendship wasn't romantic. The friend who turned down the date still wants to keep things friendly, and the author's avoidance might hurt her feelings, even if it's unintentional. So, while the author's feelings are valid, the way they're handling it by ghosting might be unkind. They should take responsibility for their actions and communicate their needs instead of just disappearing. \n\nBut is the author actually in the wrong? If they're being honest with themselves about not being able to handle the friendship anymore, maybe they're not the bad guy. However, the lack of communication is a problem. The right approach would be to talk to the friend and explain their situation, even if it's awkward. That way, both parties can understand each other's positions. Ghosting makes things harder for the other person because it leaves them confused and without closure. \n\nSo, I think the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate their feelings and instead chose to ignore the friend. While it's tough to navigate post-rejection, being upfront is better than ghosting. The answer would be A.\n"
