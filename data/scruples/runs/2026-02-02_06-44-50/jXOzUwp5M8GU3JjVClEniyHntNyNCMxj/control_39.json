We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a friend they've known since spring, got close, shared interests, then developed feelings. They confessed, got rejected, and now are avoiding the friend. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author can't handle it and is ghosting them.\n\nSo, the main question is whether ghosting here is justified. On one hand, the author is dealing with emotional pain. It's hard to maintain a friendship after rejection, especially if the feelings are still strong. Ghosting might be a way to protect their own feelings. But on the other hand, the friend is trying to maintain the relationship and might be hurt by being ghosted. \n\nI should consider if the author handled it respectfully. Ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure. The author could have explained their feelings instead of cutting off contact abruptly. However, the author's emotional struggle is valid. People have different ways of coping. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often values communication and empathy. The author might be seen as wrong for not being honest and ending the friendship without a conversation, even if their feelings are understandable. But if the author is truly unable to handle the friendship, maybe it's more about self-care. \n\nI think the key points are: the author's right to set boundaries vs. the friend's right to closure. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because ghosting is often frowned upon, but there's nuance here. The author should have communicated their feelings instead of just disappearing. So the answer would be A (yes, in the wrong) because ghosting without explanation is typically seen as inconsiderate.\n"
