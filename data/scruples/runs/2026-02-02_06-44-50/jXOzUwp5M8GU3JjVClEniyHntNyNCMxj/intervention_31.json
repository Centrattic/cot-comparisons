We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. I need to figure out if A or B is the right answer.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a friend they liked for a while but didn't act on it. Then they confessed their feelings, got rejected, and now they're ignoring the friend's attempts to stay in touch. The author feels they can't be friends anymore because it's too painful.\n\nSo, why might they be in the wrong (A)? Ghosting is generally considered rude because it's abrupt and doesn't give the other person closure. The friend wanted to stay in touch, but the author is avoiding them. Maybe the author should have communicated their need for space instead of just cutting off contact. Also, the author admits they still have feelings, so maybe they're not handling it maturely by not discussing it.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe they're not in the wrong (B). They have a right to their feelings and need time to heal. If the friendship is causing them pain, they might need to step back. But they should still communicate to be respectful. However, the issue is that they're ignoring texts, which is ghosting. Even if they can't be friends right now, a simple message explaining they need space would be better than just disappearing.\n\nSo, the key point is communication. Ghosting is often seen as inconsiderate. The author could have been honest about their feelings and need for distance. So the answer might be A because they're ghosting instead of communicating properly. But maybe the friend isn't respecting the author's boundaries. Wait, but the friend is trying to reach out, and the author is avoiding it. If the author needs space, they should say so. Ghosting is the problem here. So the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate their needs clearly and instead chose to disappear, which is hurtful even if they have valid reasons.\n"
