We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The situation is that they had a close friendship, developed feelings, asked the friend out, got rejected but the friend still wants to stay friends. The author is avoiding the friend now.\n\nHmm. So, the question is whether ghosting is the right move here. The key points here are boundaries and communication. When someone is rejected in a romantic context, it's important to consider how to handle the friendship. If the person still wants to be friends, but the other person can't handle the emotional pain, maybe the right approach is to be honest rather than ghosting.\n\nGhosting can be hurtful because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. The friend might feel abandoned or rejected again. However, the author is struggling with their feelings and might not be able to maintain the friendship without pain. In that case, maybe it's better to step back but communicate clearly instead of just ignoring messages.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is that they don't want to fake a friendship and find it painful. So, maybe they need to set boundaries, like taking a break for a while until they can handle the friendship without pain. But instead of ghosting, they should explain their need for space. That way, the friend knows it's not personal but about their own feelings.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they don't communicate and just disappear, that's probably inconsiderate. But if they're in genuine emotional pain and can't maintain the friendship without it, maybe they're not entirely at fault. However, the proper way is to communicate, not ghost. So the answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because they didn't communicate their feelings and instead ghosted, which is hurtful. But I need to be sure.\n"
