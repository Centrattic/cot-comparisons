We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a close friend they've known since spring, shared interests, and developed feelings. They confessed their feelings, were rejected but treated kindly. The friend still wants to maintain the friendship, but the author is avoiding them now, leading to ghosting.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. So, why would that be the case? Well, ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because you cut off communication without explanation. The friend is trying to reach out and wants to maintain the relationship, even after the rejection. The author's feelings haven't changed, so they find it painful to continue the friendship. \n\nBut is the author wrong? On one hand, the author has the right to their feelings and need space. If the friendship is causing emotional pain, maybe they need time to heal. However, ignoring someone who is trying to reach out might be hurtful. The author didn't communicate their need for space, which could make the friend feel rejected again. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have needed to explain that they need some time but still value the friendship. By ghosting, they're not giving the friend a chance to understand. The friend might feel confused or hurt, not knowing the reason for the sudden distance. \n\nSo, the wrong here could be the lack of communication. The author's actions are hurtful, but their reasoning is understandable. They are struggling with unrequited feelings. The right approach would have been to set boundaries respectfully. \n\nTherefore, while the author's feelings are valid, their method of handling it (ghosting without explanation) is inconsiderate. Hence, they are in the wrong.\n"
