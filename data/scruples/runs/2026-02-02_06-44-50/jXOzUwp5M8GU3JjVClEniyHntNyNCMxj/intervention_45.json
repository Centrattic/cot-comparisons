We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe user had a friend they knew since spring, shared interests, and got close. Then they developed feelings and confessed, but the friend didn't reciprocate. The author is now avoiding the friend, ignoring texts, and avoiding them. They mention that being friends is painful because their feelings haven't changed. The friend still wants to be friends, but the author can't see how that's possible anymore.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the concept of ghosting. Ghosting usually means cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The author is ignoring texts and avoiding the friend. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship, but the author is not responding. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're dealing with unrequited feelings and find it painful to continue the friendship. They might feel that avoiding the friend is their way to heal and protect their emotions. However, the friend is still reaching out and might be confused or hurt by the sudden silence. \n\nBut is it fair for the author to ghost them? The author asked the friend out, was rejected, and then decided to end the friendship. Maybe the author should have communicated their feelings about the friendship instead of just ghosting. Being upfront about needing space might have been a better approach rather than disappearing. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not feel comfortable around the friend anymore, and trying to maintain the friendship could lead to lingering pain. The friend also needs to know that the author can't continue the friendship in the same way. However, not responding at all could be seen as inconsiderate. The friend might not know why the author is pulling away and could feel rejected again or confused.\n\nSo, the author's actions are hurtful but not necessarily malicious. They didn't express their need for space and instead just stopped responding. That's where the wrong might lie\u2014ghosting without explanation. Even if the friendship can't continue, being honest and respectful in ending it would be better. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't communicate their decision properly.\n"
