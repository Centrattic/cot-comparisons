We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The person had a friend they were close to, developed feelings, confessed, got rejected, and then started ignoring them to avoid pain.\n\nHmm. So the key points here: the author approached the friend, got rejected, and now is avoiding them. They're trying to decide if this is the right move. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the situation. When someone confesses their feelings and is rejected, it's understandable that they might feel hurt. The friend was nice about the rejection and wants to stay friends, but the author can't handle the friendship anymore because of lingering feelings. \n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. The author is avoiding the friend instead of having a conversation. However, the author might be doing this to protect their own emotions. The friend is reaching out, but the author isn't responding.\n\nI should think about communication here. The better approach would be to tell the friend that maintaining the friendship is too painful and that they need space, rather than just ghosting. Ghosting can leave the other person confused and hurt, which is why it's usually seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that they can't go back to how things were before. The Pandora's box idea suggests that their feelings changed the dynamic. The friend is still trying to maintain the friendship, but the author isn't ready. \n\nIs it fair for the author to ghost? Well, maybe not the best approach, but the situation is complicated. The author isn't being malicious; they're trying to protect themselves. However, the friend might feel abandoned or rejected again. \n\nIn AITA situations, people often get called out for not communicating properly. The right move would be to explain their feelings and need for space, even if they can't be friends. So the author is in the wrong for ghosting instead of having an open conversation. They should take responsibility and communicate, even if it's hard.\n"
