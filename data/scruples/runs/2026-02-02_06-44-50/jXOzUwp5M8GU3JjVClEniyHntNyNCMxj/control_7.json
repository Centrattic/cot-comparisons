We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the user had a friend they liked, asked her out, she turned them down, and now they're ghosting her. They feel that being friends anymore is too painful because their feelings haven't changed. The friend wants to continue the friendship, but the user is avoiding her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of ghosting after being rejected. Ghosting usually means cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The user says they're ignoring texts and avoiding her. The question is whether that's wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the user is hurt and finds it painful to maintain the friendship. It's understandable to need space after a rejection. They didn't lash out or say mean things; they're just pulling back. The friend, however, might feel confused or hurt by the sudden silence. But the user isn't actively harming her, just not responding.\n\nIs it wrong to prioritize your own emotional well-being? Maybe not. But is it considerate to ghost without explaining? Probably not. The user could have explained their need for space instead of just disappearing. That might have been kinder. However, the user might not want to face the conversation, which is why they're avoiding it.\n\nThe key here is whether the user is being inconsiderate. If they genuinely can't be friends and need distance, that's their choice. But not communicating about it could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the alternative is to stay in a friendship that's causing pain, which isn't healthy either. So, maybe the user isn't in the wrong, but they could have handled it better by communicating their feelings instead of ghosting.\n\nBut the question is whether they're in the wrong. If \"in the wrong\" means morally or ethically incorrect, then maybe not. People have different ways of handling rejection. Some might need to distance themselves. However, ghosting can be hurtful even if the intention isn't to be. So, there's a balance between self-care and consideration for the other person's feelings. The user's actions are self-protective but might not be the most considerate approach. But is that being in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. I think the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because they're not actively harming her, just choosing to distance themselves for personal reasons. However, they could have handled it better by explaining. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach.\n"
