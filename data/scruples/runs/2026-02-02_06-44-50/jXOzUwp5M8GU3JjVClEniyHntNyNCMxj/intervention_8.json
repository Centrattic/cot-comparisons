We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The author had a friend they liked, confessed their feelings, got rejected but the friend wanted to stay friends. The author is now ignoring them because they can't see being friends anymore.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether ghosting is the right move here. On one hand, the author is struggling with their feelings and might need space. Ghosting can be hurtful, though. The friend is trying to reach out and maintain the friendship. The author might be avoiding the situation because it's painful for them. But by ghosting, they're not communicating their feelings clearly, which can leave the friend confused.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if you're not able to maintain a friendship after a rejection, it's understandable to need space. But instead of ghosting, maybe they should have communicated that they need time or that they can't continue the friendship. Ghosting without explanation can be considered the asshole move because it's inconsiderate. However, if the author truly can't handle the friendship and isn't being selfish but honest about their feelings, maybe it's not their fault. But the act of not responding and avoiding without explanation is where they might be wrong. So the answer might be A, because they're ghosting without giving a clear reason, even though their feelings are valid.\n"
