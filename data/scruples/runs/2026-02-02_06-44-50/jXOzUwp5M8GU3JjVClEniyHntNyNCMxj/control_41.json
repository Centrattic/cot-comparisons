      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. They had a good friendship since spring, shared interests. The author developed feelings but didn't act on them until they confessed. The friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. The author feels that their friendship can't go back to how it was, so they're avoiding her texts and trying to ghost her, even though she wants to stay friends.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nHmm. So, from a general perspective, when someone is rejected, it's common to feel hurt and need space. The author is struggling to maintain the friendship because their feelings haven't changed. Ghosting is usually considered rude, but in this case, the person is emotionally unavailable. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author can't handle it. \n\nBut is ghosting the right approach? Some might say it's better to be honest and set boundaries rather than just stop responding. However, the author might not want to hurt their friend more by being direct. \n\nI think in these situations, communication is key. Even if you can't be friends, explaining your need for space would be better than ghosting. But the author might be doing this to protect their feelings and avoid ongoing pain. \n\nOn one hand, not responding could be seen as inconsiderate because the friend is reaching out. On the other hand, the author is dealing with unrequited feelings and can't move past it. \n\nI'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because they're not intentionally being mean; they're just trying to protect themselves emotionally. But maybe they should have communicated their need for space. However, since they've already taken the step to avoid her, maybe they are in the wrong for not being upfront. \n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the friend is trying to stay friends and the author is ignoring her, that could be seen as the author being a jerk. But the author's reasoning is valid\u2014they can't be friends anymore. So maybe it's a grey area. But in AITA threads, sometimes the person who is emotionally struggling isn't seen as the asshole if they're being honest about their feelings. But ghosting is usually a no-no. \n\nI think the answer is B. They're not in the wrong because their feelings are genuine, but they could have handled it better by communicating. Since they're not being mean but are struggling, they might not be the asshole. So the answer is B.\n"
