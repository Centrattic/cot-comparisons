We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The situation is that the author had a friend they liked, confessed their feelings, got rejected, and now is avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend turned them down, and the author is struggling with their feelings. The friend wants to remain friends, but the author can't handle it and is ghosting. \n\nGhosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. Even if the author is hurt, cutting off communication abruptly might not be the best approach. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author isn't responding. \n\nHowever, the author's feelings haven't changed, and they find it painful to continue the friendship. It's understandable that they're struggling, but how they handle it matters. Maybe a more direct approach, like explaining that they need space, would be better than ghosting. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author's emotional state, the friend's efforts to stay in touch, and the method of handling the situation. Ghosting is usually frowned upon, so the author might be in the wrong here. But maybe there's a middle ground. Still, the act of ignoring texts and avoiding without explanation is likely the issue. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because ghosting isn't respectful, even if they're hurting. They should communicate their need for space instead of disappearing.\n"
