We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe user is asking if they're the a**hole for ghosting a friend after she turned them down. They had a close friendship since spring, shared interests, and then they confessed their feelings. The friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. Now, the user is avoiding her texts and hanging out, because they can't go back to being just friends. They mentioned it's painful to stay in the friendship because their feelings haven't changed.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics of the situation. The user had a friend and developed feelings, which is common. They mustered the courage to ask her out, which takes guts. She declined, which is also common. Now, the user is struggling with moving on and is ghosting her. The question is whether that's wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the user is being honest about their feelings not changing, which is tough. They're not trying to force a friendship that's causing them pain. Ghosting is usually seen as inconsiderate, but sometimes it's a last resort when someone can't handle the emotional burden. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the user feels it's not possible anymore.\n\nOn the other hand, ghosting can be hurtful because it leaves the other person without closure. The friend might be confused or worried if the user stops responding. However, the user is clear that they don't hold the friend's rejection against her, which shows maturity. They might need space to process their feelings, and avoiding the friend is a way to protect their emotional well-being.\n\nI need to think about whether the user is wrong. The key points are: did they handle it respectfully? Ghosting isn't the best approach, but the user's motivation is their own emotional pain. The friend wants to continue the friendship, so ignoring her could be seen as not respecting her wishes. However, the user might not be able to handle the friendship anymore, which is understandable. \n\nIn some cases, it's better to have a conversation about needing space rather than ghosting. But the user might not be ready for that conversation. Still, ghosting can make the other person feel unimportant. So maybe the user is in the wrong for not communicating their need for space, but not necessarily for wanting to avoid the friendship. \n\nI think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the user is dealing with a painful situation and is trying to protect their feelings. However, the method of ghosting is questionable, but the intent is to move on, not to be cruel. The friend's insistence on continuing the friendship might not align with the user's need for distance. So the user isn't wrong for prioritizing their emotional health, even if the approach could be better.\n"
