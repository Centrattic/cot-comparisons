We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.

There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they have a friend they've known since spring, and they developed feelings for her. They finally confessed, but she turned them down. Now, they're ghosting her because they can't be friends anymore, even though she wants to stay friends. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was friends first, then had a crush, confessed, got rejected. The friend was nice about it and wants to keep being friends, but the author is avoiding her. \n\nFrom one perspective, the author is being honest about their feelings. They might feel that being friends after rejection is too painful because their feelings haven't changed. It's their right to set boundaries if being around her is causing emotional distress. But on the other hand, ghosting someone after a rejection might be seen as cutting them off without communication. The friend might feel hurt or rejected again, even though she said she wanted to stay friends.\n\nIs the author obligated to continue the friendship? Not necessarily. After a romantic confession and rejection, the dynamics of the friendship can change. The author might not be able to move on and might need space. However, not responding and avoiding without explaining could be hurtful. Maybe the author should have communicated their need for space instead of ghosting. But the user says they don't hold it against her and it's a Pandora's box situation. \n\nIn some cases, people need time to process and move on. If the author isn't ready to be friends, it's their choice. But ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person confused. The right thing would be to explain that they need time and space, even if they can't continue the friendship. However, the author might not be in the wrong because they're prioritizing their emotional well-being. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (they're not in the wrong) because they're not obligated to force a friendship if it's painful. But the method of ghosting is questionable. Depending on the interpretation, but the question is whether they're in the wrong. The community often says that after a rejection, the person who confessed can't expect the friendship to continue as before, but they should handle it with communication. Ghosting without explanation could be seen as wrong, but if the author is just ending the friendship because they can't handle it, maybe they're not in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No). They're not in the wrong for ending the friendship if it's too painful, but they should have communicated better. However, the question is about being in the wrong. Since the friend didn't reciprocate, the author's decision to step back isn't necessarily wrong. So B.\n"
