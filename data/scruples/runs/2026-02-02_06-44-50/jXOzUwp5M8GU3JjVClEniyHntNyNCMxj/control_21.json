We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. They had a good friendship since spring, they developed feelings, confessed, got turned down nicely, but they can't be friends anymore because they still have feelings and it's painful. They're ignoring texts and avoiding her now.\n\nSo, do they deserve the blame here? Well, when someone is rejected, it's normal to feel hurt and need space. The friend didn't react angrily or badly; she was nice and wants to stay friends. But the author is struggling with the friendship post-rejection. Ghosting isn't ideal because it's abrupt and can leave the other person confused. However, if the friendship is too painful and they can't move on, maybe it's understandable. The key points are the friend's desire to continue and the author's emotional state. While ghosting is impolite, the situation might be a matter of personal feelings. The author isn't being malicious, just avoiding for their own well-being. So, maybe they're not in the wrong, but could have handled it better, like being honest about needing space. The answer might be B (No), but I should check if there's more nuance. Since the author isn't doing it out of spite and has valid emotional reasons, they might not be at fault. But some might argue that they should try to maintain the friendship if the other person wants it. It's a bit of a gray area, but the question is whether they're in the wrong. Ghosting is generally frowned upon, but if the alternative is being in a painful situation, maybe it's not entirely their fault. Hmm. I think the answer is B, not in the wrong, but with a caveat.\n"
