      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person has been friends with someone since spring. They really liked each other's company and shared interests. The author developed feelings for the friend but was too shy to act. Eventually, they confessed, but the friend didn't reciprocate the feelings. The friend was nice about it and wants to stay friends, but the author feels that being in a friendship is now painful because their feelings haven't changed. So the author has started ignoring the friend's texts and avoiding them, which is being called ghosting.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I need to evaluate this.\n\nFirst, let's consider the concept of ghosting. Generally, ghosting is when someone suddenly cuts off all communication without explanation. It's often seen as inconsiderate because the person being ghosted is left confused and without closure. In this case, the author is avoiding the friend and not responding to texts. So technically, this is ghosting.\n\nNow, the author's reasoning is that they can't maintain the friendship after having unrequited feelings. They don't want to be in a painful situation anymore. The friend, on the other hand, wants to continue the friendship and is trying to reach out.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's emotional state, the friend's intention to maintain the friendship, and the method of handling the situation (ghosting).\n\nFrom the friend's perspective, they're trying to be understanding and maintain the friendship. They didn't reject the author harshly; they were nice and want to stay friends. The author, however, is avoiding communication, which can be hurtful. The friend might feel rejected again or confused because they don't know why the author is pulling away.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in emotional pain. Maybe they feel that staying in contact is too difficult. It's possible that the author hasn't had the emotional strength to handle the friendship anymore. They might be trying to protect themselves from further hurt.\n\nBut the issue is whether ghosting is the right approach. In most advice scenarios, experts say it's better to communicate your feelings, even if it's hard. If the author can't be friends anymore, they should explain that to the friend, even if it upsets them. Ghosting leaves the friend in the dark and can cause more hurt.\n\nHowever, the author might not be in a place to have that conversation. If they're emotionally overwhelmed, maybe avoiding is their only coping mechanism. But that's not an excuse for ghosting, which is generally considered poor communication.\n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. They have valid reasons for not wanting to continue the friendship, but the way they're handling it (ghosting) is problematic. They should have communicated their need for space or explained that they can't continue the friendship, even if it's painful for the friend. By not doing so, they're being inconsiderate.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they're not communicating their boundaries and are instead cutting off contact without explanation, which is hurtful and leaves the friend confused. They should have had a conversation, even if it's difficult.\n"
