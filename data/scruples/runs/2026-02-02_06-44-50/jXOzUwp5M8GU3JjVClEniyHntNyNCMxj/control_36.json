We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone who ghosted their friend after being turned down for a date. They've known each other since spring, got along well, and the friend was nice but didn't reciprocate feelings. The author now feels they can't go back to being friends, so they're ignoring texts and avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if ghosting here is justified. The key points are: the friend was understanding and didn't close the door completely, the author's feelings haven't changed, and they're avoiding the friendship to prevent pain. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication abruptly without explanation. However, the author might be struggling with the emotional difficulty of moving on and maintaining a friendship after rejection. \n\nIs the author being fair to their friend? The friend wants to stay in touch, but the author is ghosting. Even if it's hard, being honest about needing space or not being able to continue the friendship is better than ignoring them. Ghosting can leave the friend confused and hurt, not just the author. So, the author might be in the wrong by not handling the situation with more communication and consideration.\n\nBut maybe the author is not in the wrong if they genuinely can't handle the friendship anymore. However, the expectation is to evaluate if they made a mistake. The friend tried to be supportive, but the author's response is to cut them off. That could be seen as selfish or inconsiderate. The right approach would be to explain the situation, even if it's difficult, to avoid leaving the friend in limbo. So, the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because ghosting isn't the best way to handle this, even if the author's feelings are valid.\n"
