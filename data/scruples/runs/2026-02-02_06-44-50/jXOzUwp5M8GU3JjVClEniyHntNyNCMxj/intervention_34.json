We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. The situation is that they had a close friendship, developed feelings, confessed, got rejected, and now are avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the situation. The author liked their friend and asked them out. The friend was kind but didn't reciprocate. The author feels they can't continue the friendship because their feelings haven't changed, so they started ghosting. The friend wants to stay in touch, but the author is avoiding them.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, ghosting is generally considered rude because it's abrupt and leaves the other person confused. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship, but the author isn't responding. Even if the author is hurt, they could have communicated their feelings instead of just cutting off contact. Honesty and setting boundaries are better than ghosting. The author might have valid reasons for not wanting to be friends anymore, but the way they're handling it is problematic. They could have explained they need space without disappearing completely. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're avoiding communication instead of addressing it respectfully.\n"
