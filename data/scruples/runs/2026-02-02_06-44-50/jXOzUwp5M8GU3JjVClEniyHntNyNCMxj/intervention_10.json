We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. The situation is that they had a friend since spring, got close, then confessed feelings and got rejected. Now the friend wants to stay friends, but the author is avoiding her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. When someone is rejected, it's common to feel hurt and maybe want some space. But ghosting\u2014cutting off communication entirely without explanation\u2014can be seen as inconsiderate. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author is ignoring her. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they still have feelings and staying friends would be painful. That makes sense emotionally. But from a social standpoint, not responding to messages and avoiding someone can leave the other person confused and hurt. The friend might not understand why the author is pulling away, especially if they were the one to initiate the relationship.\n\nHowever, the author isn't being malicious. They're dealing with their emotions and trying to protect themselves. But the problem is that ghosting doesn't give the friend a chance to understand or adjust. It might be better to have an honest conversation about needing space, even if the friendship can't continue as before. The author could have said they need time to process and maybe can't be friends anymore, but instead chose to disappear, which is more hurtful.\n\nSo, the key points here are the intention versus the action. The author's intention is to avoid further pain, but the action of ghosting is considered rude. Friends deserve some level of communication, even if it's hard. The author is in a tough spot, but the way they handled it might be inconsiderate. So, the answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
