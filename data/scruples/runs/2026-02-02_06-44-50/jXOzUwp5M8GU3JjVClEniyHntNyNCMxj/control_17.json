We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting a friend after being rejected. The person is asking for an answer A or B, yes or no.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author had a friend they liked since spring. They developed feelings but were too scared to act. Then they confessed, and the friend was kind but didn't reciprocate. The author now feels it's impossible to go back to being friends, so they've been ignoring texts and avoiding her. The author's reasoning is that staying friends would be painful because their feelings haven't changed.\n\nNow, to determine if they're in the wrong. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because it cuts off communication abruptly without explanation. However, the author's reasons are understandable. They might not be ready to handle the friendship anymore. But is that a valid reason to ghost? \n\nOn one hand, the author's feelings are valid. They might need space, and it's hard to be friends with someone you're still in love with. But on the other hand, ghosting can leave the other person confused and hurt, even if they said they wanted to stay friends. The author could have handled it more gracefully, maybe by explaining that they need some time and space, rather than just cutting off contact.\n\nThe key points here are communication and respect. The author's actions lack communication, which is a problem. Even if they can't be friends, a clear message would be kinder. However, their emotional state is understandable. They might be hurting and trying to protect themselves. But the friend might also be trying to maintain the friendship, which the author is avoiding.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, ghosting is usually considered rude regardless of the reason. Even if the reason is emotional pain, the way they're handling it is inconsiderate. The right approach would be to communicate their feelings honestly, even if they can't continue the friendship. Therefore, the answer is A (they are in the wrong) for not communicating properly and ghosting instead of being upfront.\n"
