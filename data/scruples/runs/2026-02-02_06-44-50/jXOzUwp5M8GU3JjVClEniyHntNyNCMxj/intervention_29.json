We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.

There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. \n\nFirst, let me break down the situation. The person had a close friend since spring, shared interests, and then developed feelings. They confessed but were rejected. Now, the friend wants to stay friends, but the person is ignoring her texts and avoiding her. The author says it's too painful to continue the friendship because their feelings haven't changed.\n\nSo the question is: is the author in the wrong? The user thinks they are, but wants my opinion. \n\nHmm. On one hand, the author was honest about their feelings. That's important. When someone has romantic feelings, it's better to communicate that than to let it fester. The friend was nice in rejecting them, but the author is struggling with the shift from a romantic to a platonic relationship. \n\nGhosting, though, is generally seen as cutting off communication without explanation. The author is avoiding the friend after the rejection. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship, but the author is not responding. \n\nBut wait, the author's reasoning is that being friends is now painful. It's understandable to need space after rejection. However, ghosting is abrupt. Maybe the author should have communicated that they need time or space, rather than just disappearing. That way, the friend isn't left confused. \n\nBut the author might not be able to handle the emotional pain of being friends anymore. It's a tough situation. The friend wants to continue the relationship, but the author can't see how to move past the rejection. \n\nIs the author at fault? Ghosting is often frowned upon because it's inconsiderate. The author could have been honest about their feelings and explained that they need time, or even that they can't continue the friendship. Instead, they're ignoring the friend's attempts to connect. That leaves the friend in the dark. \n\nHowever, if the author truly can't handle the friendship anymore, maybe they are protecting themselves. But is it fair to the friend? The friend might be confused or hurt if the author just disappears. The author could have been more open about needing space. \n\nIn AITA posts, the key is often about communication and respect. Even if the author is emotionally struggling, cutting off without explanation might be seen as inconsiderate. The author should have communicated their need for space, even if they eventually can't be friends. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate their feelings properly and instead ghosted. Alternatively, some might argue that the author isn't at fault because they're dealing with their emotions. But I think the consensus would lean towards A, as ghosting is typically seen as a lack of respect for the other person's feelings.\n"
