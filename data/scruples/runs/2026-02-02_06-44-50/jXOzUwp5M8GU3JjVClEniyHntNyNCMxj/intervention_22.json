We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting a friend after being turned down. The situation is that they had a friendship, developed feelings, asked the friend out, and got rejected. Now the friend wants to stay friends, but the author is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around ghosting. Ghosting is generally when you cut off someone suddenly without explanation. The author is avoiding texts and interactions, which is a form of ghosting. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author is pulling away.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's actions (ghosting), the friend's intentions (wants to stay friends), and the author's reasoning (can't be friends due to ongoing feelings). \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend was clear about not wanting to be in a relationship but still wants friendship. The author's choice to ghost could be seen as avoiding the situation rather than communicating. Even if the author can't move on, being upfront might be better than cutting off contact. However, it's also possible that the author is protecting their own feelings, but that doesn't necessarily excuse ghosting. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author can't continue the friendship, they should explain that to the friend, even if it's hard. Ghosting is usually frowned upon because it leaves the other person in the dark. So, the author might be in the wrong for not communicating their decision to step back from the friendship. \n\nBut there's also the aspect that the author might need space. However, the right approach would be to be honest, even if it's painful. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong for ghosting instead of having a conversation.\n"
