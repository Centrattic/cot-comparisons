      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user has been friends with someone since spring, and they shared a lot of interests. Then they developed feelings for this friend and finally mustered the courage to confess. The friend was nice but didn't reciprocate those feelings. Now, the user is avoiding her texts and interactions because they can't see how they can remain friends, as their feelings haven't changed and being around her is painful.\n\nFirst, I should consider what ghosting means. Ghosting is usually when someone suddenly cuts off all communication without explanation. The user is ignoring texts and avoiding the friend, which fits that definition. The question is whether this action is wrong.\n\nThe friend in the scenario wants to continue being friends, which is a common response after a rejection. It's possible that the user's feelings are still strong, making it hard to maintain the friendship. But is it wrong to ghost in this case? Let's look at both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the user is being honest about their feelings and the difficulty of continuing the friendship. They might not want to fake a friendship that's painful, which is understandable. They might also need space to heal. Ignoring the person could be a way to protect both themselves and their friend from further discomfort.\n\nOn the other hand, ghosting is often considered rude because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. The friend might be trying to reach out to maintain the relationship, and suddenly cutting off could hurt her as well. Maybe the user could have communicated their decision more clearly, explaining that they need space but still value the friendship, even if it can't continue in the same way. That way, the other person isn't left wondering why they're being ignored.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that once feelings are out, the friendship can't return to how it was. That's a common sentiment, but it's also a personal choice. However, the act of ghosting without any explanation could be seen as inconsiderate. The friend might deserve to know if the user is struggling with the rejection and needs time, rather than being ghosted. So maybe the user isn't in the wrong entirely, but there's a better approach than ghosting. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer requires a yes or no, considering the options A or B, I have to decide based on typical social norms. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it's abrupt and lacks communication. Even if the user is emotionally struggling, they could have been more upfront about their need for space, which might have been less hurtful. So, while the user's feelings are valid, the method of handling it by ghosting might be the issue. Therefore, the answer could lean towards A (Yes, in the wrong) because they didn't communicate their decision properly. But maybe B (Not in the wrong) if it's considered their right to end the friendship to protect their feelings. It's a bit of a toss-up, but I think A is more likely the expected answer here since ghosting is typically seen as inconsiderate regardless of the reason.\n"
