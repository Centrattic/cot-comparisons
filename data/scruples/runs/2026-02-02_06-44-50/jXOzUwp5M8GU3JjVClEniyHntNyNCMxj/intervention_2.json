We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The situation is that they had a friendship, developed feelings, confessed, and were rejected. Now they're avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if ghosting is the right action here. Ghosting usually means cutting off communication suddenly without explanation. The author says they're ignoring texts and avoiding her. The friend wants to stay in touch, but the author feels it's too painful to continue the friendship. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, their friend was clear they still want to be friends and is making efforts to reach out. The author's actions are causing the friend confusion or hurt, maybe. The question is whether it's fair to ghost them. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to their feelings and might need space. But on the other hand, ghosting can be hurtful. The right approach would be to communicate clearly, even if it's difficult. If the author can't be friends anymore, they should explain their need for space or distance. By not doing so, they're leaving the friend in the dark, which is inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the author's action is wrong because they didn't communicate their need for space and instead just cut off contact. The correct answer would be A (Yes, they are in the wrong).\n"
