We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a friend, developed feelings, confessed, got turned down, and now they're ghosting the friend. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The person confessed their feelings, and the friend declined. Now they're avoiding and ignoring the friend because they can't go back to being just friends. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, ghosting after being rejected could be seen as dismissive. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author feels it's painful. But is it their fault for not being able to handle the friendship anymore? \n\nFrom one angle, the author has a right to their feelings and might genuinely find it hard to be friends. However, ghosting isn't a respectful way to handle it. They should communicate their needs instead of cutting off. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not communicating and just ghosting. \n\nBut if the author truly can't be friends, maybe it's understandable. But the friend is trying to reach out, so the author's response is ghosting. That's not fair to the friend, who might not know why they're being ignored. The author should explain their feelings instead of disappearing. \n\nSo the answer might be A (yes, wrong) because they're not being honest and are avoiding communication. But also, the author isn't the one who initiated the rejection, so maybe they're not wrong. \n\nHmm. The key is whether ghosting is the wrong approach. Most people would say that even if you can't be friends, you should be polite and explain. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not being upfront and just cutting off. So answer A.\n"
