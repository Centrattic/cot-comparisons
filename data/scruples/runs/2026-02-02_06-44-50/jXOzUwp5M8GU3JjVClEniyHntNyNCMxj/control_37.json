      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They had a friendship since spring, shared interests, and then the author developed feelings. They confessed but the friend didn't reciprocate. The friend still wants to stay friends and keeps reaching out, but the author is avoiding her because they can't see being friends anymore and it's painful.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer choices are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The author had a crush, asked the friend out, and was rejected. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship despite the rejection, but the author is finding it hard and is cutting off contact. Ghosting typically means abruptly ceasing all communication without explanation. The author is ignoring texts and avoiding her, which is a form of ghosting.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, treating someone with respect is important. Ghosting can be hurtful, even if the person is trying to be a friend. The author might be feeling that their feelings can't be ignored, but cutting off communication without a clear reason might leave the friend confused or upset. The friend, on the other hand, is trying to be understanding and preserve the friendship. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they can't go back to how things were and that being friends is painful. But is it wrong to avoid that pain by ending the friendship? Maybe not in terms of personal feelings, but the way they're handling it (ghosting) could be the issue. It's possible the friend deserves a proper explanation rather than being ghosted. \n\nHowever, the author might be in a vulnerable state and need space to process. Sometimes people handle rejection by needing distance, which isn't necessarily wrong. The problem is the lack of communication. Ghosting often lacks closure, which can be inconsiderate regardless of the situation. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It could depend on cultural context and individual norms. If the friend really wants to continue the friendship, the author should at least communicate their need for space. Ghosting might be selfish because it doesn't consider the other person's feelings. On the other hand, if the author is truly unable to maintain the friendship and it's causing them distress, they aren't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to step back. The method (ghosting) is where they might be at fault. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author isn't wrong for needing space after a rejection, but they should communicate that. However, the question is about being in the wrong in general. Since they are ghosting without explanation, some might argue they are inconsiderate. But others would say they have the right to prioritize their well-being. So it's a bit of a gray area. But the central issue is the ghosting, which is generally seen as disrespectful. So maybe A (Yes) is the answer. Wait, but the friend is the one who rejected them. The author might feel that the friendship can't continue. \n\nHmm. In relationships, honesty is key. The friend is trying to maintain contact, but the author is avoiding. If the author can't be friends and is in pain, maybe it's better to end the friendship but do it respectfully. Ghosting is usually bad form, but if the author can't handle the friendship, they might not be in the wrong for stepping back. The key is whether they should have communicated their decision. If they didn't, it's wrong. But the question is whether they are in the wrong for ghosting. So, I think the answer is B (No), because the author isn't wrong for not wanting to be friends anymore, but they should have communicated. However, the act of ghosting is what's questionable. Depending on interpretation, some might say it's not their fault for feeling that way, but the way they handled it is wrong. Since the options are A for yes (in the wrong) and B for no, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for their feelings or the decision, but the method is. But the question is if the author is in the wrong overall. Maybe it's a no because they aren't being malicious, just hurt. But others might say yes because ghosting is still a poor choice. I'm leaning towards B here, but I'm not entirely sure. The key is the ghosting, but the reason is rejection. It's possible that the author isn't in the wrong for their feelings but the act is. However, the options don't allow for that nuance. The answer is either A or B. So, if the question is about the action (ghosting), then the answer is A (yes, in the wrong). But the options are about the author's wrongness in the situation. The author's problem is not in the decision to avoid, but in how they're handling it. Since the options are about being in the wrong, and the method is ghosting, which is inconsiderate, the answer might be A. But the author's intention is to prevent pain, not to be cruel. So maybe it's a no. This is tricky. I'm going to go with B (No), because the author's choice to step back isn't inherently wrong, but the ghosting is. However, the options are binary. The correct answer is B.\n"
