We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. First, I need to understand the situation. The author had a friend they liked, asked her out, she said no, and now they're ignoring her texts and avoiding her.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: the friend was kind but rejected them, wants to stay friends, but the author can't handle the pain of continuing the friendship. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because you don't communicate. But the author says they don't want to hold grudges, just can't be friends anymore because of lingering feelings.\n\nWait, the author's reasoning is that staying friends would be painful. So they're prioritizing their own emotional well-being. But is that a valid reason? Ghosting can hurt the other person even if you're the one who's hurt. Maybe the right approach would be to explain that they need space, not just disappear. But the question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often get criticized for not communicating. Even if you decide to end the friendship, being abrupt is usually frowned upon. The friend is trying to reach out, and ignoring her might be seen as harsh. However, if the author can't handle the friendship anymore, they might not be in the wrong for needing to step back. But the method of doing it (ghosting) could be the issue, not the decision itself.\n\nSo maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong for needing to create distance, but they should have communicated. However, the question is about being in the wrong in the situation, not the method. Since they're acting based on their feelings and not being malicious, maybe they're not in the wrong. But some might argue that ghosting is still wrong regardless. This is a bit of a toss-up. \n\nI think in AITA context, people often are called out for ghosting even if they have reasons. So maybe the author is in the wrong. But others might say it's understandable. The answer could go either way. But given that ghosting is typically seen as inconsiderate, the answer might be A. But the user's situation is about personal feelings and not handling it well. Hmm.\n"
