We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a friend they liked, confessed their feelings, got turned down, and now are ghosting the friend. The friend wants to continue the friendship, but the author can't handle it and is ignoring them.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author's actions are justified. When someone confesses feelings and gets rejected, it's natural to feel hurt. The author says they can't go back to being friends because their feelings haven't changed, which makes sense. But is it wrong to ghost someone after that?\n\nGhosting usually means cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The author is ignoring texts and avoiding the friend. However, the friend is trying to reach out and wants to stay friends. The author might think that maintaining the friendship is painful, but maybe they should at least explain their need for space instead of just disappearing. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to their feelings and might not be ready to be around someone they still have feelings for. If they truly can't be friends and it's causing them distress, maybe they need time to process. However, ending the friendship without communication could be seen as inconsiderate, even if it's for their own well-being. \n\nBut the key points here: The author was clear about their feelings, got rejected, and now is struggling. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author can't. The author isn't being mean or cruel, just avoiding. So is this the author's fault? It's a tough spot. Maybe they should have communicated their need for space instead of ghosting. But the friend might not understand and keep trying to reach out, which the author can't handle. \n\nIn these situations, it's often considered better to be honest about needing distance rather than ghosting. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not communicating their feelings and just cutting off. However, the alternative could lead to more hurt if they don't address it. \n\nHmm. So the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they should have communicated their need for space instead of ghosting. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, they might not be in the wrong (B) because they have a valid reason to need distance. \n\nLooking at similar AITA scenarios, usually, if someone is hurt and needs space, it's better to explain that. Ghosting without any explanation is often seen as the asshole move, even if there's a reason. So maybe the answer is A. The author is in the wrong for not being honest about their need for distance and just cutting off communication."
