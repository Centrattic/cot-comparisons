We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a friend since spring, they shared interests, then the author developed feelings but was too scared to act. They confessed, got rejected, and now the friend wants to stay friends but the author is avoiding them. The author feels that remaining friends would be painful because their feelings haven't changed.\n\nSo, the question is whether ghosting is wrong here. Ghosting usually means cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The author says they're ignoring texts and avoiding the friend. The friend, on the other hand, is trying to maintain the friendship. \n\nNow, the author's reasoning is that they can't be friends anymore due to unresolved feelings, which is understandable. However, ghosting is often seen negatively because it's inconsiderate and lacks communication. The author could have been honest with the friend about needing space or that they can't continue the friendship, instead of just ignoring them. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the author's emotional well-being. If staying friends would be too painful, maybe it's justified to step back. However, the way they're doing it (ghosting) might be considered inconsiderate. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author communicated their feelings properly. If they had a conversation explaining that they need time or can't stay friends, it would be more respectful. Since they're just avoiding and ignoring, that's where the fault might lie. So the author is in the wrong because they aren't communicating, even if their feelings are valid. \n\nBut there's a nuance. If the author is too emotionally overwhelmed to communicate, maybe they're not intentionally being cruel. Still, the act of ghosting is still seen as wrong because it's not respectful to the friend. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship and deserves a response, even if it's a difficult one. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A (author is in the wrong) because ghosting without explanation is inconsiderate, even if the feelings are genuine. They should have communicated their needs instead of cutting off contact.\n"
