We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ghosted their friend after being turned down is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend knew them for a while, they had a good relationship, the author developed feelings, confessed, got rejected, and now is avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and communication. When someone expresses interest and gets rejected, it's important to handle the transition back to friendship or moving on. The author is avoiding the friend, which is ghosting. Ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure.\n\nThe friend is trying to maintain the friendship, but the author can't see how they can be friends anymore. The problem is that the author isn't communicating their feelings clearly. Instead of ghosting, a better approach would be to have an honest conversation about why they can't continue the friendship. That way, both parties understand the situation.\n\nGhosting is often considered rude because it's abrupt and doesn't give the other person a chance to respond or adjust. Even though the author is hurt, intentionally cutting off communication without explanation can be seen as putting the onus on the other person to figure out what's wrong, which isn't fair.\n\nHowever, the author's rationale is that being friends is painful. It's valid to feel that way after a rejection, but the method of handling it matters. If the author is being honest with themselves and the friend, maybe they need some time apart. But doing it through ghosting is the issue here.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong for not communicating their feelings and instead choosing to ghost. They should have had a conversation to explain their need for space and why continuing the friendship isn't possible right now. Ghosting doesn't respect the other person's right to know and can cause more hurt."
