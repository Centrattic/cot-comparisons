We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a friend they liked, confessed their feelings, got rejected, and then started ghosting the friend. The question is whether ghosting is the wrong move here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a close friendship, developed feelings, and was rejected. They feel that continuing the friendship is painful because their feelings haven't changed. They chose to ignore the friend's attempts to stay in touch. \n\nGhosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure. However, the author's reasoning is that they can't maintain the friendship without it being painful. They don't hate the friend, just can't handle the emotional strain. \n\nOn one hand, cutting off communication abruptly can be hurtful. The friend might be confused or feel rejected again. On the other hand, the author is dealing with their own emotions and trying to protect their well-being. \n\nBut in relationships, especially friendships, communication is key. Instead of ghosting, the author could have explained their need for space or that they're not ready to continue the friendship. That would be more considerate. Ghosting avoids the conversation and can make the other person feel like they did something wrong, even though they were clear about wanting to stay friends.\n\nThe author's perspective is that they can't go back to how things were, but maybe they could have set boundaries. They might be in the wrong for not communicating their feelings properly. However, it's also understandable that they're struggling with rejection. \n\nI think the key point here is that ghosting isn't the right approach. The author should have had an open conversation about their feelings and needs. So the answer is A, they are in the wrong for ghosting instead of communicating.\n"
