We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author had a close friendship since spring, shared interests, and developed feelings. They confessed, got rejected, and now they're avoiding the friend. The friend wants to stay in touch, but the author feels it's too painful and has been ghosting them.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author is at fault. The key points here are about boundaries, communication, and emotional impact.\n\nWhen someone is rejected, it's natural to feel hurt. The author is choosing to ghost instead of communicating openly. Ghosting can be hurtful because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. The friend is trying to reach out, so ignoring them might be seen as unkind. But the author is also dealing with their own emotions and might not be ready to handle the friendship anymore.\n\nOn one hand, the author isn't in the wrong for having feelings or needing space. It's their right to prioritize their emotional well-being. However, cutting off communication without explanation can make the situation worse. A better approach might be to set boundaries clearly, like saying they need time and space, which could be more respectful than ghosting.\n\nBut is the author actually at fault? Maybe not. They're struggling with their emotions. However, the way they're handling it (ghosting) could be seen as inconsiderate. So the answer might depend on whether you prioritize the author's need for space or the friend's right to closure. Since the author isn't malicious but is acting out of pain, maybe they're not in the wrong, but their method is questionable. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I think the answer leans towards B because the author isn't malicious, but their actions are still hurtful. However, the core question is if they're in the wrong. Since they acted out of emotional difficulty and not malice, maybe they aren't in the wrong. So B. No.\n"
