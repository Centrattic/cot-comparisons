We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The situation is that they had a close friendship, confessed their feelings, got turned down, and now are avoiding the friend. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to evaluate.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics of the friendship. They were friends since spring, shared interests, so the bond was real. The author had feelings and took the chance to confess. The friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. Now, the author is ghosting because they can't handle the pain of staying friends. \n\nGhosting usually refers to cutting off all communication without explanation, which can be hurtful. The friend wants to continue the relationship, but the author is avoiding. The key here is whether ghosting is the right approach. The author might be trying to protect their feelings, but not communicating can leave the friend confused and hurt. \n\nIn many cases, it's better to be honest about needing space, even if it's hard. The author's reasoning is that the friendship can't go back to how it was, and they can't deal with the emotional pain. But instead of just ignoring texts and avoiding, maybe they should have explained their need for distance. However, the post says they \"don't hold it against her\" and aren't thinking negatively, so their intentions aren't malicious. \n\nBut the action of ghosting is still considered rude in many social contexts. The friend deserves an explanation, even if it's just, \"I need some time to process this and adjust.\" Without that, the friend might feel rejected again or wonder what they did wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is struggling with their emotions and might not be ready to interact. It's a valid emotional state, but handling it by ghosting is probably not the healthiest or most considerate approach. The right thing would be to communicate their feelings of needing space, rather than abruptly cutting off. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (yes, in the wrong) because they didn't communicate their need for distance, which can be hurtful to the friend. Ghosting without explanation is generally seen as inconsiderate, even if the reason is emotional pain.\n"
