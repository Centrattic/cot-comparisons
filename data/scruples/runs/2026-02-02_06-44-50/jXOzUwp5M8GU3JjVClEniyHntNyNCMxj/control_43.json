      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person had a close friendship with someone since spring, shared interests, and fell in love with her. They confessed their feelings, she declined but was kind. Now, the author is avoiding her texts and avoiding the friendship because they can't go back to how it was, and being around her is painful.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider different angles. \n\nOn one hand, the friend was clear and kind in rejecting, and wants to stay friends. The author, however, is struggling to move forward and is now ghosting her. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person hanging without closure. The author isn't communicating their feelings anymore, which could be hurtful. The friend might feel confused or rejected again, even though she already turned down the romantic interest. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's feelings haven't changed, and they genuinely can't be friends anymore. They might need space to heal. Sometimes, taking time away to process emotions is necessary. However, ghosting is a poor way to handle it. The author could have communicated that they need space, even if they can't continue the friendship. \n\nThe key here is communication. Ghosting prevents the other person from understanding the situation, leading to potential hurt. The author's intention is to avoid ongoing pain, but cutting off without explanation could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person acted with consideration. Since the author isn't giving a reason for their actions, the friend is left in the dark. So, while the author's feelings are valid, the method of handling it (ghosting) is where they might be in the wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate their feelings and instead chose to ghost, which is considered rude and inconsiderate, even if their reasons are understandable.\n"
