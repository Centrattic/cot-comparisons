We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The situation is that they had a close friendship since spring, shared interests, and then one side developed feelings. They confessed and were turned down nicely. The friend wants to stay friends and keep texting, but the author can't handle the pain of remaining in the friendship and has started ignoring her.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author is wrong for ghosting. First, I need to consider the norms around rejection and friendship. Ghosting is generally seen as cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The user is doing that after being rejected, which might be a tough situation. \n\nOn one hand, the friend was kind and wants to maintain the relationship. Maybe the author should have communicated their discomfort instead of ghosting. People often feel hurt when someone ignores them without a reason. But on the other hand, the author is dealing with unrequited feelings and finds it painful. They might need space to process their emotions. \n\nIs it fair to ghost someone who didn't reject them in a mean way? Maybe not. The author could have said they need time or space instead of just disappearing. However, the situation isn't malicious; it's about emotional pain. So while ghosting isn't ideal, the intent is to protect their own feelings. \n\nBut friendships require mutual respect and communication. By ghosting, the author might be causing hurt to their friend who's trying to be understanding. The right approach might be to be honest about not being able to continue the friendship but in a respectful manner. \n\nSo the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because even though their feelings are valid, ghosting isn't a respectful way to handle it. They should have communicated their need for space instead of ignoring her.\n"
