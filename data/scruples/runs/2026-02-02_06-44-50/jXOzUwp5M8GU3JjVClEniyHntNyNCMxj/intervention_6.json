We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The scenario is that they had a good friendship, developed feelings, confessed, and got rejected. Now they're avoiding the friend, and the friend wants to stay in touch, but the author can't see how they can be friends anymore.\n\nHmm, first, the key issue here is ghosting after a rejection. Ghosting is usually when you cut off communication without explanation, which can be hurtful. The author says they feel their feelings haven't changed, so being friends is painful. But the friend is trying to maintain the relationship. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong because ghosting isn't the healthiest way to handle this. Instead of just ignoring texts and avoiding them, they could have communicated their feelings. Even though they're upset, the friend might appreciate knowing why they're pulling away. However, the author's feelings are valid too. It's hard to be friends after a romantic rejection, and maybe they need space.\n\nBut the problem is that the friend is reaching out and wants to continue the friendship, while the author is not responding. That could make the friend confused or hurt, especially if they don't know the reason. The author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate because they're not giving the friend closure or an explanation. So, while the author's emotional state is understandable, the way they're handling it by ghosting is probably not the best approach. They should have talked to their friend about their feelings instead of just ignoring them. So, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because ghosting is a passive-aggressive way to handle the situation, even if the emotions are real.\n"
