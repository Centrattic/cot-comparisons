      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author of this AITA question is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person has a friend they've known since spring. They got along well, shared interests, and the author started developing feelings. They were too shy to act on it, so they confessed their feelings and asked the friend out. The friend was kind but didn't reciprocate the feelings. Now, the author can't go back to how things were before, and the friend is trying to maintain the friendship by texting and approaching the author. However, the author is ignoring the texts and avoiding her because they still have feelings for her and find it painful to keep being friends. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's considered \"wrong\" here. Ghosting is generally seen as cutting off communication without explanation, which can be hurtful. But the context matters. The author was rejected but still has feelings, making it difficult to continue the friendship. The friend is trying to stay in touch, but the author is avoiding them to avoid pain.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel that maintaining the friendship is causing them emotional distress because they can't move past their feelings. They might not want to pretend to be friends when it's painful. On the other hand, the friend who rejected their advances might feel hurt by being ghosted, especially if they were trying to be understanding and wanted to remain friends. \n\nIn relationships, open communication is usually encouraged. If the author is avoiding the friend because they can't handle the situation, maybe they should have communicated that rather than just ghosting. However, sometimes people struggle with emotional pain and might not know how to handle it. The question is whether the author's actions are justified given their emotional state.\n\nAlso, the friend was \"really nice\" about the rejection and wants to continue the friendship. This suggests the friend is considerate. The author's ghosting could be seen as adding insult to injury, even if the friend didn't reciprocate feelings. The friend might have expected some distance but not complete silence. \n\nBut at the same time, some people might argue that it's natural for the author to feel this way and that they're not in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being by stepping back. However, the right way to handle it would be to explain their need for space rather than just ghosting, which is abrupt and can leave the other person confused or hurt.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author was rejected, is still in love, is struggling to maintain the friendship, and is avoiding communication. The friend is trying to stay in touch. The author's actions are ghosting, which is typically seen as inconsiderate. However, the context of unrequited love and emotional pain might mitigate some blame. \n\nIn many AITA scenarios, ghosting is frowned upon unless there's a valid reason. Here, the reason is emotional pain, but the friend was trying to be accommodating. If the author had communicated their need for distance, maybe it's more understandable. Since they didn't, and just disappeared, that's where the wrong could lie. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong for not communicating their feelings properly and instead ghosting. But maybe there's a middle ground. However, the question is a binary choice between A and B. Given the typical AITA responses, ghosting is usually considered inconsiderate, so the author is in the wrong (A). But I should check if there's a nuance here. Maybe the friend kept reaching out, making it hard for the author, but the author could have set boundaries. So, AITA scenarios often prioritize communication. So the answer is A.\n"
