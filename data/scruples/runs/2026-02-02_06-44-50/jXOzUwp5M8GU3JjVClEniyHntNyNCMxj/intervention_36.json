We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for ghosting their friend after being turned down. They've been friends since spring, had mutual interests, and they developed feelings. They finally confessed, and the friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. Now, the friend wants to stay friends and tries to contact them, but the author is ignoring her to avoid pain.\n\nHmm. So, the core issue here is whether ghosting is justified in this situation. The friend didn't reject them harshly; she was nice and wants to continue the relationship as friends. The author's problem is that they can't go back to how things were because their feelings are still there. But by ghosting, they're making it harder for their friend, who might be trying to maintain the friendship.\n\nI think emotions here are valid. The author is hurting, and it's common to feel like you can't be friends with someone after a rejection. But ghosting without communication can be seen as inconsiderate. The friend is making an effort to reach out, so cutting off contact suddenly might not give her a chance to understand the situation. Maybe the right approach would be to explain that they need space, even if they still have feelings. That way, it's respectful and clear. However, if the author truly can't handle the friendship anymore, it's understandable, but they should communicate that instead of vanishing. So, I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because ghosting isn't the healthiest way to handle this. They should have been honest about their need for distance.\n"
