We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.

There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author had a close friendship with someone since spring, shared interests, and developed feelings. They confessed, got rejected, and now are ignoring the friend's attempts to stay in touch. The friend wants to continue the friendship, but the author can't see how that would work without it being painful. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical or social aspects here. Ghosting usually refers to cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. But the author says they're ignoring texts and avoiding her. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, so the author's actions might be seen as hurtful. However, the author is also dealing with lingering feelings, which can affect their emotional well-being.\n\nIs it wrong to ghost? Well, it depends. If the author is avoiding their friend because they can't handle the emotional pain, that's understandable. People react differently to rejection. Some might need space to heal. But the friend is trying to keep things the same, and the author's avoidance could make the friend feel dismissed or confused. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be protecting themselves. If the friendship is no longer comfortable and being in contact is causing pain, maybe they have a valid reason. But communication is usually key here. Ghosting without explaining your feelings could leave the friend in the dark, making them wonder what they did wrong or why the author is pulling away. \n\nThe friend's perspective is important. If she's trying to stay friends and the author doesn't respond, that could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might have been better off setting boundaries or explaining their need for space. However, if the author truly can't maintain the friendship without it being painful, that's their right. \n\nAnother angle: the author didn't act on their feelings until after the friendship was established. Once they were rejected, they decided to end the friendship. The friend might feel that she handled things well and deserves a respectful response, even if the author can't continue the relationship. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author's actions are justified. If they're unable to be friends without pain, maybe it's a personal struggle, but cutting off communication entirely without explanation could be the wrong approach. A better solution might be to be honest about their feelings and set boundaries, rather than ghosting. Ghosting can be hurtful regardless of the reason, but the author's intention is to protect their own emotions. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is being considerate. If they're leaving the friend hanging without any closure, that's inconsiderate. But if they're trying to protect themselves and the friendship can't continue, maybe they're not entirely in the wrong. However, the socially responsible thing is to communicate, even if it's hard. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not being upfront and instead choosing to ghost.\n"
