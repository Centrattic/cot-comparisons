We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThey had a good friend since spring, shared interests, and they developed feelings. They confessed, the friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. The author now feels that being friends is painful because their feelings haven't changed. The friend wants to stay in touch, but the author is ignoring texts and avoiding her. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. Ghosting is when you cut off communication without explanation. The author is doing that, but their reasoning is that they can't handle the friendship anymore after rejection. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, which the author can't do. \n\nIs it wrong to ghost? Well, ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person confused. But there are exceptions. If someone is in emotional pain and can't continue the relationship, maybe they're not in the wrong. The author isn't being malicious; they're avoiding because of their own feelings. The friend, on the other hand, might feel hurt by the sudden cutoff. \n\nBut the author tried to be upfront about their feelings. The rejection wasn't their fault. Now, they're struggling with the friendship. It's a tough spot. Even though ghosting is usually bad, if the person is genuinely unable to maintain the friendship, maybe they're not in the wrong. They should have probably communicated better, like explaining their need for space instead of just ignoring. But given the circumstances, is it their fault?\n\nI think the key here is intent. The author isn't trying to be hurtful, just protecting their own feelings. So maybe they're not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
