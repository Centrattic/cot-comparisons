      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're at fault for ghosting their friend after being rejected. They had a friendship since spring, got close, then confessed their feelings. The friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. The author now finds it hard to continue the friendship because their feelings haven't changed, so they're ignoring her texts and avoiding her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of ghosting. Ghosting usually means cutting off communication abruptly without explanation, which can be hurtful. However, the context here is important. The author had a crush on their friend and was rejected. They feel that continuing the friendship is painful because they still have feelings. They mention the friend wants to stay friends and tries to reach out, but the author is avoiding contact.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend was clear in her rejection, but still wants to maintain the friendship. The author's response is to ignore her, which could be seen as ghosting. But is this the wrong approach? If the author is struggling with their emotions and can't see how they can be friends without pain, maybe they need space. However, ghosting without any communication is generally frowned upon because it leaves the other person confused and hurt. \n\nBut there's nuance here. The author might be trying to protect themselves from further emotional distress. If they can't handle the friendship anymore, maybe they should have communicated that. However, the friend is trying to reach out, so ignoring her might be unkind. The key point is whether the author considered the friend's feelings in their decision. If they didn't explain, the friend might be left wondering why the connection was lost. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author really can't bear to be friends and might continue to have unrequited feelings, avoiding the friendship could be a self-preservation tactic. It's not necessarily malicious; they're just not ready. But the ethical angle is about respecting the friend's desire to continue the relationship and not making the friend feel like they did something wrong. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they could have communicated their need for space but chose to ghost instead, then yes. But if they're genuinely unable to interact without being emotional and it's the only way to protect their feelings, it's a tough spot. The community often advises that honesty, even if it's uncomfortable, is better than ghosting. But the author's reasoning is that they can't see how the friendship can go back to normal. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author made an effort to communicate their feelings. Since they didn't, and just ignored the friend's attempts, that's probably the issue. But maybe there's a cultural or situational factor I'm missing. In some cases, if the friendship is causing pain, it's understandable to step back. However, the appropriate action is to explain the situation rather than disappear. So, the author is in the wrong for not communicating their decision, even if their feelings are valid. Hence, Answer A.\n"
