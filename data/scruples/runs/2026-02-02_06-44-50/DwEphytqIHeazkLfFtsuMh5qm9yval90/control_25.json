She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a customer at a deli who ends up with overcharged meat and then leaves without saying anything, leaving the employee confused.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee sliced it, and the customer agreed to a little over. But the final price was almost $12 for 1.745lbs at $6.98. The customer points out the discrepancy, the employee says the price has increased but the sign hasn't changed. The customer then points out the weight is over a pound, and the employee starts reweighing but ends up with an even smaller amount. The customer gets frustrated and leaves.\n\nSo, the key points here are whether the employee made a mistake with the price and the weight. The customer is correct in noticing the price discrepancy and the weight being more than requested. The employee's response about the price not being updated is a possible error by the store, which the customer is right to point out.\n\nThe customer's reaction: they were polite initially, then became irritated when the employee didn't address the weight issue properly. The employee seems to be trying to fix it but ends up making it worse. The customer leaves, not wanting to deal with it further. \n\nNow, is the customer in the wrong? Well, the customer's actions were in response to what they perceived as errors by the store. The employee's behavior might have been confusing or unhelpful. The customer's frustration led them to leave without further confrontation. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong: The customer was correct in pointing out the price and weight issues. The employee's mistake was on the store's part. The customer's leaving might be seen as impolite, but the situation escalated quickly. The customer might not be in the wrong because they were trying to correct an error and then couldn't handle the employee's response. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The store made the pricing error and the employee's handling of the situation contributed to the problem. The customer's frustration is justified given the circumstances.\n"
