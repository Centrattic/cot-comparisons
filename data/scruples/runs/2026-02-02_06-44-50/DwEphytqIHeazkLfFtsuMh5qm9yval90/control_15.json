She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter misunderstanding regarding the price and weight of turkey meat.\n\nFirst, let me break down the events. The author went to the deli, asked for 1lb of oven-roasted turkey at $3.98/lb, thinly sliced. The employee gave them 1.745lbs charged at $6.98/lb. The author noticed the mistake, pointed it out, and the employee initially denied it. The employee then tried to fix it by taking out the meat, but the author got frustrated and left without finishing the interaction.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author was polite when pointing out the mistake. The employee made an error, perhaps in pricing or weighing. The employee tried to correct it but maybe in a way that the author found unsatisfactory. The author left in frustration without completing the transaction.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't yell or act aggressively. They tried to point out the mistake politely. The employee's response might have been unhelpful or dismissive. However, the author left without resolving the issue. But the question is whether they're in the wrong for doing that. \n\nIn such situations, customers have the right to question pricing errors. The employee might have been defensive or not helpful, leading to the author's frustration. Walking out might be impolite, but if the employee wasn't addressing the issue correctly, maybe the author had no patience left. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should have tried to speak to a manager. But the author says they didn't want to be \"that guy\" causing a scene. So, they chose to leave instead. \n\nSo, considering the situation, the employee made a mistake, the author tried to correct it, and when the employee didn't handle it properly, the author left. The author's actions might be seen as justified due to the employee's mishandling. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
