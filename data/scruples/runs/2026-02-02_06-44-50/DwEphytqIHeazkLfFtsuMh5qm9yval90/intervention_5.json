She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter interaction where the customer left without resolving a pricing and weight discrepancy.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb, but the deli girl gave 1.745 lbs at $6.98/lb. The customer points out the mistake, the employee says the price sign wasn't updated, then the customer notices the weight is over a pound and more expensive. The employee tries to fix it by putting 2 slices and tearing another, resulting in a different weight, but the customer gets upset and walks out without speaking to a manager or addressing the error further.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the customer had a right to question the incorrect pricing and weight. The employee made a mistake, which is unfortunate, but the customer's reaction was to walk out. Was it reasonable to expect the customer to handle this calmly? The customer was polite initially, but after the employee's response, they became irritated. Then, when the employee tried to fix it, they put the basket down and left. \n\nThe customer might argue that they were stressed or had a low tolerance for the situation, leading to a loss of patience. The employee, on the other hand, might have been trying to correct the mistake, but the customer's abrupt exit could be seen as uncooperative. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the customer made a valid point about the weight and price being wrong. However, the way they responded\u2014walking out without further communication\u2014could be considered rude. The employee was in the process of correcting the mistake when the customer left. The customer could have said they wanted to return another day or left it on the counter for the employee to handle. Instead, they walked out without a word, which might leave the employee confused or unsure of the next steps. \n\nBut the customer also had the right to be frustrated. The employee didn't initially check the price, just assumed the sign was correct. Then, after the customer pointed out the weight was over a pound, the employee had to take time to repackage. The customer might have felt it was an unnecessary hassle and chose to leave. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about the proportionality of the reaction. The customer's action was to walk out, which is a bit harsh but perhaps not entirely wrong. However, not saying a word might be seen as inconsiderate. The employee might have been trying to fix the issue, so the customer's silence and exit could be seen as uncooperative. \n\nOn the other hand, if the customer was just done with the interaction and didn't want to escalate it by talking to a manager, their choice to leave might be understandable, even if abrupt. The key here is whether the customer's actions were a reasonable response to an ongoing mishandling situation. \n\nThe main question is whether the customer was wrong to leave the meat and not communicate. The original story says they left the basket on the ground and walked out. Leaving the meat might not be ideal for the employee, but the customer might have felt that continuing the conversation would have been too much. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on cultural norms and expectations. In some contexts, leaving without a word is considered rude. But given the circumstances, maybe the customer's frustration is justified. However, the fact that they ignored the employee after she corrected the weight could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nThe final judgment is whether the customer's reaction was disproportionate. The employee made a mistake, but the customer's abrupt exit without explanation might be the asshole move. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
