She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this situation. So the user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused after a pricing and weight issue.\n\nFirst, the story: The author goes to the deli and asks for 1lb of oven-roasted turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gives them 1.745 lbs, but charged at $6.98/lb. The author points out the mistake, the employee says the price increased but didn't change the sign. Then the author argues about the weight. The employee rebags it by taking out meat, but the author gets so annoyed they just leave without saying anything.\n\nSo, the main points here are the pricing error and the weight discrepancy. The employee might have made a mistake in pricing, charging more than the sign indicated. Then there's the weight being over a pound, which the employee had asked if that was okay. The customer agreed to \"a little over,\" but maybe the weight was more than expected. The employee then tried to correct it by removing some meat, but the customer was frustrated and left.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they did point out the mistake politely and tried to resolve it. When the employee tried to correct it, maybe the process was inefficient or frustrating. The customer might have felt that the employee was not helpful, or maybe the customer felt disrespected. But walking out without saying a word might be rude. However, maybe the customer was just done with the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the employee might have been confused when the customer left, but the customer's frustration is understandable given the pricing error and the back-and-forth. The customer had the right to correct the mistake and leave if they weren't satisfied with the resolution. \n\nIn terms of responsibility: The store is at fault for the pricing error. The customer is not in the wrong for pointing it out. The employee might not have handled the situation well, but the customer's action of leaving was their choice. The customer didn't escalate it to a manager, which some might see as not trying to resolve it fully, but others might say they just wanted to end the stressful encounter.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The customer had a legitimate issue, handled it politely, and chose to leave after the employee's confusing attempts to fix it. It's a stressful situation, and the customer's frustration is valid. They're not the asshole here.\n"
