She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter misunderstanding.\n\nFirst, the author went to the deli, asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745lbs but charged at $6.98/lb, which is more expensive. The author noticed the mistake, pointed it out, and the employee tried to correct it by taking out meat, but the author got frustrated and left without saying anything.\n\nSo, the key points here: The employee made a pricing error. The author pointed it out politely. The employee then tried to fix it but maybe not in the best way\u2014putting 2 slices, tearing another, etc. The author then left without paying, which could be seen as theft if they didn't pay for the meat they took. But wait, did they actually take the meat? They left it with the employee. The story says they put their basket down and walked out. The employee was holding the pile of meat, so maybe the author didn't take the meat but just left without resolving the issue.\n\nIs the author wrong for leaving without resolving? Well, the correct action would be to either pay for the meat (if they wanted to buy it) or return it and leave. If they left without paying, that's theft. But in the scenario, the employee had taken the meat back, rebagged it, and was trying to correct the weight. The author then walked out. If the author didn't take the bag and left, maybe they just left the meat with the employee, so no theft. But the confusion is whether the author took the meat without paying. Since they left the basket and walked out, perhaps they didn't take the meat. However, if they had the bag and left, that would be different.\n\nThe employee might have been in the process of correcting the issue, but the author's frustration led them to leave. Is that the right move? The author could have said \"I don't want to deal with this, I'll come back another time\" or asked to speak to a manager. Instead, they left without a word, which could be seen as rude or inconsiderate. But if they didn't take the item, maybe there's no legal wrong. However, the ethical aspect is whether they should have handled it differently.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not resolving the situation politely. The employee made a mistake, the author was polite, but when the employee tried to fix it, the author left. Not necessarily stealing, but maybe not handling it properly. However, the employee had the meat, so maybe the author didn't take anything. The main issue is the manner of leaving without a word. In terms of the store's policy, the author was being treated to an overcharge, then the employee corrected it but perhaps not to the author's satisfaction. The author's frustration is understandable, but walking out without resolving it might be the asshole move. Alternatively, if the author didn't take the meat, maybe they aren't in the wrong. The answer depends on whether leaving without paying is considered wrong. Since the employee had the meat back, maybe the author didn't take it. So, the author isn't in the wrong for leaving, but maybe for not handling it more politely. However, the question is about being in the wrong. The answer might be B, not in the wrong, because they didn't take the meat. But if they left without paying for the meat they had initially, that's different. Wait, the author initially had the meat, then the employee took it back. The author didn't pay anything. So if they left without paying for the meat they had, that's theft. But in the story, the employee was trying to correct the weight and charge less. The author might have been overcharged initially, then the employee was trying to fix it. If the author left the meat with the employee, they didn't take it. So maybe no theft. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. But the social aspect is about handling the situation. The employee was trying to correct the issue, the author could have said they don't want the meat and left. Instead, they left without a word. That's rude but not necessarily wrong. So answer B.\n"
