She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter interaction where the customer left in frustration.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The deli employee gave them 1.745 lbs but charged $6.98/lb. The customer pointed out the mistake, the employee said the price had increased but didn't update the sign. Then the customer was told that they were okay with it being a little over. But the weight was way over. The employee then tried to fix it by taking out slices, but the customer got frustrated and left without saying a word.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the employee made a pricing error, the customer tried to correct it, and the employee was dismissive. The customer then left, which the employee finds confusing.\n\nThe customer's actions: they politely pointed out the mistake, the employee was uncooperative. The customer then left without further confrontation. The question is whether this is justified.\n\nLegally, the store might be charging the wrong price, so the customer is justified in pointing that out. The employee's behavior seems unprofessional, not correcting the mistake properly. The customer's frustration is understandable. Walking out could be seen as a reasonable reaction after the employee's dismissive attitude. The customer might have escalated the issue by talking to a manager, but they chose not to. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's not polite to just leave without a word, given the employee's actions, the customer might have felt it was unnecessary to continue the interaction. The customer's main goal was to buy groceries, and the store's mistake disrupted that. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The employee made errors, and the customer had the right to leave. The answer should be B."
