She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about a deli counter interaction where the customer ends up leaving without resolving the issue, which seems to have escalated due to the employee's handling.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sequence of events. The customer ordered 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb, but the employee charged $6.98/lb and gave almost 1.75 lbs. The customer pointed out the discrepancy, the employee initially denied the mistake, then tried to repackage the meat. The author got irritated, left without saying anything, and is now asking if they're the asshole.\n\nThe key points here are the employee's actions and the customer's response. The employee made a mistake in pricing, perhaps by not updating the sign, and then tried to correct it by repackaging. However, the way she handled it\u2014arguing the weight, tearing slices, and not clearly communicating\u2014probably frustrated the customer. The customer, already stressed, lost patience and left.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, they did try to point out the mistake politely. The employee's behavior might have been unprofessional or unhelpful, leading to the customer's irritation. The customer didn't escalate to a manager, which is a valid option, but walking out without a word could be seen as abrupt. However, the employee's actions might have prompted that response. \n\nIn this context, the employee's mistake and poor customer service likely contributed to the customer's frustration. The customer's actions, while perhaps abrupt, might be a reaction to the employee's handling. So, the customer isn't entirely at fault. The answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
