She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused with a pile of meat without saying a word.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author went to the deli, asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee sliced it and said it might be a bit over. The author agreed. But when the author checked, the weight was 1.745 lbs at $6.98/lb, which is way more expensive. The author politely pointed out the mistake, and the employee corrected the price but then seems to have messed up the weight, giving only a few slices. The author then left without speaking further.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author's reaction was justified. The employee made a pricing error initially, then tried to correct it by taking back the meat and repackaging it. The author found the employee's actions confusing or possibly incorrect again (the weight being too little), leading to frustration and leaving without resolution.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for not dealing with a confusing situation and just walking away. The user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong but wants to know the community's take.\n\nPossible angles to consider: \n\n1. **Employee's Responsibility**: The employee was supposed to handle the pricing and weight correctly. When the author pointed out the price discrepancy, the employee corrected the price. Then, when the weight was over a pound, the employee tried to repackage it. However, the employee might have made a mistake again by not giving the correct weight, leading to the author's frustration.\n\n2. **Author's Response**: The author tried to remain polite, pointed out the mistake, and when the employee tried to correct, the author might have felt the correction was inadequate (only a few slices). The author then left, not wanting to escalate to a manager. The user's question is whether this action was wrong.\n\n3. **Communication Issues**: The employee might have been confused or made errors, but the author's abrupt exit could have left the employee without feedback on where they went wrong. However, the author might have felt that dealing with the employee further was not worth their time and stress.\n\n4. **Right vs. Wrong**: The author's goal was to buy groceries correctly. The employee's errors led to frustration. The author's decision to leave could be seen as a reasonable response to poor service, or as a failure to address the issue properly, which could be considered inconsiderate.\n\nIn the AITA context, people often consider if the author took the high road. The author did try to resolve it politely but ultimately walked away. Walking away without a resolution might be seen as not following up, which could leave the problem unresolved. However, the author might have felt that the employee was uncooperative or making things worse, leading to a justified exit.\n\nThe key points here are whether the author handled the situation appropriately. The employee made mistakes, but the author's final action was to leave without further communication. Depending on perspective, the author might be in the wrong for not ensuring the issue was resolved, or not in the wrong because they were dealing with a confusing and possibly rude employee.\n\nGiven that the author tried to correct the initial error but the employee's subsequent actions (repackaging with too little meat) might not have resolved the issue, the author's frustration is understandable. However, leaving without explanation might not be the best approach. The answer might hinge on whether the author's exit was justified given the employee's actions or if they should have pushed further.\n"
