She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused with a pile of meat without saying a word. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author went to the deli, asked for 1lb of turkey meat at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745lbs priced at $6.98/lb. The author pointed out the discrepancy, and after some back and forth, the employee tried to fix it, but the author got fed up and left without paying.\n\nSo, the key points here are the pricing mistake and the author's reaction. The employee initially charged the wrong price and weight. The author noticed and tried to correct it, but the employee was confused or not helpful. The author then left without paying, which could be seen as abandoning the purchase or even stealing if they didn't pay for the meat they took.\n\nThe employee might have made a mistake, but the author's action of leaving without paying could be problematic. Even if the employee was at fault, not paying for the items you took is still wrong. The author could have either paid the correct amount, asked for a refund or adjustment, or left without the meat but not with the meat. Taking the meat and leaving without paying is theft, regardless of the employee's error. So the author is in the wrong here.\n"
