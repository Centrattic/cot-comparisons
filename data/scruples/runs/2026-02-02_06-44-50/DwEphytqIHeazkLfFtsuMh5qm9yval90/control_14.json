She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused and without speaking after a pricing issue. \n\nFirst, the author went to the deli, asked for 1lb of turkey meat at $3.98/lb. The deli employee sliced it, mentioned it might be a bit over, and the author agreed. But when the author saw the total, it was $12.18 for 1.745lbs at $6.98. The employee said the price sign wasn't updated. The author points out the weight, the employee then starts rebagging, taking only two slices and half of another. The author leaves without resolving it.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author act inappropriately? The employee made an error in pricing and weight. The author tried to point out the mistake but got an unhelpful response. The employee then started to adjust the amount, but the author walked out. \n\nThe author's actions seem to stem from frustration. The employee's behavior was confusing and possibly incorrect in handling the situation. The author didn't escalate to a manager but left the store. In terms of responsibility, the employee is supposed to handle such issues, but the author's irritation led them to walk out. However, the author is the customer, and while they have the right to leave, maybe they should have at least tried to resolve it. But given the employee's unclear actions, the author's patience was tested. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The employee was the one who made the mistake and perhaps mishandled the correction. The author's response was to leave, which might be impulsive, but considering the confusion and lack of clear communication from the employee, maybe it's understandable. So, the answer might be B (No), because the employee was at fault in the pricing and weight discrepancy, and the author's frustration is justified. However, the author didn't say anything to the employee after walking out, which might be seen as not being polite. But the employee was the one who needed to correct the mistake, so the author's immediate exit could be a reasonable reaction to the stress and confusion.\n"
