She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused. \n\nFirst, the situation: The customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave 1.745lbs at $6.98/lb. The customer points out the mistake, the employee says the price was updated but the sign wasn't. The customer is upset about the weight and price discrepancy. The employee then tries to fix it by taking meat out, but the customer walks out without saying anything.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the customer (the author) was wrong to leave abruptly. Let's break it down.\n\nThe customer was polite initially, pointing out the mistake. The employee made an error in pricing and weight. The employee tried to correct it, but the customer got fed up and left. The key here is the customer's reaction. \n\nThe customer might have felt frustrated because the employee didn't seem to understand or address the issue properly. Maybe the employee was confusing or not helpful, leading to the customer's irritation. However, the customer could have escalated the issue by asking to speak to a manager or at least asked for a refund. Instead, they left without resolving it, leaving the employee confused.\n\nBut was that wrong? The customer might have had enough and didn't want to argue. The employee's actions might have been slow or unhelpful, contributing to the customer's frustration. However, the customer's abrupt exit without resolution could be seen as rude, especially if the employee was genuinely trying to fix the problem. The customer might have been justified in their frustration but could have handled it more professionally. \n\nOn the other hand, the employee made a mistake, and the customer was correct to point it out. The employee's response about the price change not being updated on the sign might be true, but the weight was over 1.7lbs, which the customer was right to question. The customer's main issue was the overcharge and excessive weight. If the employee was trying to correct it, the customer leaving might have made the employee lose track of the correct amount. \n\nSo, the customer had a valid reason to be upset about the price and weight. The employee's handling of the situation was poor. However, the customer's reaction of just walking out without resolving it might be seen as inconsiderate. The customer could have at least left a message or ensured the employee knew to correct it. \n\nBut the question is whether the customer is in the wrong. If the customer was right about the mistake and the employee was being unhelpful, maybe the customer isn't in the wrong for leaving. Alternatively, the customer could have handled it better. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate because they left the employee confused. The employee was trying to fix the issue, and the customer's abrupt exit might leave her unsure of what to do next. However, the customer's frustration is understandable given the situation. \n\nIn the end, the customer's main fault is not resolving the issue and leaving the employee in a difficult spot. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate their intention to leave properly and left the employee confused. Even though the employee had a problem, the customer's abrupt exit was rude. However, the customer's frustration is valid. But according to the story, the customer left without explanation, which is considered inconsiderate. So, the answer is A.\n"
