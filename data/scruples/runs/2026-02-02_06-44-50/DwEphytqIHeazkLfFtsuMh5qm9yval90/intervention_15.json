She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person went to the deli, asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98 per pound, but was given 1.745lbs priced at $6.98 per pound. The employee said the price had gone up but the sign wasn't changed, and then the author tried to point out the weight discrepancy. The employee then took the meat back, rebagged it by tearing slices in half to get the weight down, and then the author just left without saying anything.\n\nFirst, the employee made a mistake with the price and the weight. The author pointed out the error politely. The employee tried to correct it by reducing the weight, but maybe the method was off-putting. She took out the meat, tore slices in half, which might have been unappetizing or just seemed like a bad way to handle the product. The author got really frustrated and left, not speaking the employee again. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the employee made a mistake, and the author was trying to correct it. But when the employee tried to fix it, maybe the method was not good, and the author's reaction was to walk out. The author might be in the wrong if they left without trying to resolve the issue, like talking to a manager. But the employee's actions might have been unprofessional, making the author lose patience. \n\nThe author was polite initially but got irritated when the employee didn't seem to take responsibility, especially when the employee asked where the 1.745 was written. The employee's response might have been dismissive, leading the author to feel disrespected. However, leaving without saying anything might be seen as not handling the situation properly. \n\nIn some cases, if the employee was being uncooperative, the author's frustration is understandable. But the author could have tried to escalate the issue to a manager instead of leaving. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't attempt to resolve the issue, even if the employee was at fault. Alternatively, if the employee's behavior was clearly wrong and the author couldn't handle the situation, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nI think the key here is that the author had the right to point out the mistake, but walking out without trying to resolve it further could be seen as the wrong move. The correct action would be to speak to a manager or seek a refund. The author's frustration is valid, but the way they handled it might be problematic. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't try to resolve the issue properly. But maybe some would say the employee's actions made the author's reaction justified, so answer B. Hmm. It's a bit tricky. The employee was incorrect, but the author left without trying to fix it. So I think A is correct, but I'm not 100% sure.\n"
