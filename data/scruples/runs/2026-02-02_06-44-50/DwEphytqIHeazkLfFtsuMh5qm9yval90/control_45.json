She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a deli counter where the customer ends up with a much more expensive product than intended.\n\nFirst, the customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The deli employee gave them 1.745lbs at $6.98/lb. The customer noticed the error and pointed it out calmly. The employee first denied the mistake, then tried to fix it by reducing the amount, but the customer became frustrated and left without saying a word.\n\nSo, the key points here are: The employee made a pricing error, the customer pointed it out politely, the employee was uncooperative, and the customer left in frustration. \n\nThe main question is whether the customer (the author) was wrong for leaving without resolving the issue. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the customer had the right to question the incorrect charge. The employee's behavior was unhelpful, maybe even deceptive if they intentionally used the wrong price. The customer's frustration seems justified given the employee's attitude. However, walking out without trying to resolve it could be seen as not following up properly, like not asking to speak to a manager. \n\nBut considering the employee's response, maybe the customer felt that escalation wouldn't help, and their stress level was high. The customer's actions, while abrupt, might be understandable under the circumstances. \n\nThe employee was at fault for the pricing error and the poor customer service. The customer's main wrongdoing is not attempting to resolve the issue further, but given the employee's behavior, it's debatable. The customer's frustration is valid, so maybe they aren't in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the customer's actions were a reaction to poor service and an error. They tried to address it but lost patience, which is understandable. The employee was the one who made the mistake and didn't handle it well. So the customer isn't in the wrong.\n"
