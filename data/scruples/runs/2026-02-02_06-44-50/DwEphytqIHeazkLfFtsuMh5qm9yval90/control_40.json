She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation involves a deli employee making a pricing error and the customer's reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The customer asked for 1 lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee ended up giving them 1.745 lbs but charged at $6.98/lb, which is a higher price. The customer pointed out the mistake, and the employee tried to justify it by saying the price increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then, the customer was told it's \"a little over\" in weight, but the actual weight was more than double. The employee then tried to fix it by taking out the meat, but instead of properly measuring 1 lb, she took a few slices and rebagged it, which the customer found unsatisfactory.\n\nThe customer then left without saying a word, not speaking to a manager. The question is whether the customer is in the wrong for leaving without addressing the issue further.\n\nSo, from a consumer rights perspective, the customer is being overcharged. The employee made a mistake in both weight and price. The customer pointed out the mistake, and the employee tried to correct it but maybe not adequately. The customer's frustration is understandable given that they were being overcharged. However, leaving without attempting to resolve the issue further (like talking to a manager) could be seen as avoiding the problem. But on the other hand, the customer might have felt that the employee was not handling the situation correctly, leading to their loss of patience.\n\nThe key points are the employee's error and the customer's response. The customer did try to address the issue but was not satisfied with the resolution. The employee's actions (not updating the sign, incorrect weighing) could be seen as the store's fault. The customer's reaction of leaving might be impulsive, but the store is responsible for their employee's mistakes. So, the customer might not be in the wrong here because they were a victim of the error. However, not following up with a manager might be a missed opportunity for resolution. But given the frustration level, maybe it's understandable.\n\nIn conclusion, the main issue is the store's fault. The customer's reaction, while abrupt, is a result of being overcharged and not getting a satisfactory resolution. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
