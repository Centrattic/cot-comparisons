She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused without saying a word. The situation is about a price discrepancy and the customer's reaction.\n\nFirst, the customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee charged 1.745lbs at $6.98/lb, which is way more expensive. The customer pointed out the mistake, and the employee responds that the price has increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then the customer is confused about why it's over a pound when they only asked for one. The employee takes it back, rebags it with just a few slices and some torn pieces, and the customer, frustrated, walks out.\n\nSo, the main points here are whether the customer acted appropriately. The employee made an error in pricing and quantity. The customer tried to correct it politely, but the employee was uncooperative, maybe even a bit defensive. The customer then left in frustration without completing the transaction. \n\nThe options are A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). I need to determine which one makes more sense. The customer's irritation is understandable because they were overcharged. The employee's response about the price sign not being updated might be a problem, especially if the sign was outdated and the customer was misinformed. The customer tried to address the weight issue, but the employee didn't seem to take it seriously. The customer's action of walking out could be seen as avoiding conflict, but maybe the employee was at fault for not handling the situation properly. \n\nIn similar situations, if a merchant makes a mistake, the customer has a right to question it. If the employee is unhelpful, the customer is within their rights to leave. The author didn't argue or cause a scene, just walked out. So, I think the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the employee made the error and didn't handle it correctly, leading the customer to lose patience. The customer's actions are a reasonable response to being overcharged and not getting a satisfactory explanation.\n"
