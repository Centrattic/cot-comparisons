She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter interaction where the customer got charged a higher price than expected and then left without resolving it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee priced it at $6.98/lb for 1.75lbs. The customer pointed out the discrepancy in price and weight. The employee said the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then, when the customer noted the weight was over a pound, the employee started rebagging, taking a few slices, tearing one in half, and weighing it again. The author then left without saying a word, leaving the employee confused.\n\nNow, considering the rights and wrongs here. The employee made a mistake in pricing, maybe due to the sign not being updated. The customer tried to point it out. The employee then tried to correct the weight. But the customer walked out instead of completing the transaction or asking to speak to a manager.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the customer was trying to get a correct price and weight. The employee was being uncooperative, not acknowledging the price discrepancy initially, then trying to adjust the weight. The customer's frustration is understandable, especially since the situation was confusing and possibly overpriced. Walking out might be seen as not being polite, but if the customer felt the employee wasn't resolving it, maybe it's justified. Alternatively, the customer should have tried to resolve it through proper channels, like a manager.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key points are usually about the customer's actions and whether they were reasonable. The author was polite, pointed out the mistake, but when the employee was uncooperative, left. Some might say the author should have persisted to get the correct charge. Others might say the employee was not helpful, so the customer's frustration is valid, and they were just done with the hassle.\n\nSo, the answer is a bit nuanced. But since the question is AITA, the author's action of walking out might be seen as wrong because they didn't resolve it, but the employee was also at fault. However, the main question is if the author is in the wrong. Given that the customer was trying to get the correct price and the employee was being confusing, the customer's frustration is justified. However, not addressing the issue by leaving without a word could be seen as rude. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't try to resolve it further. But I'm not entirely sure. The options are A or B. I think A (author is in the wrong) because they could have asked for a manager instead of leaving the employee in a difficult position. They were the customer, so they have the right to correct the pricing, but leaving abruptly might be considered rude.\n"
