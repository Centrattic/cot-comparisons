She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The person went to the deli, asked for 1 lb of turkey at $3.98 per pound. The employee said the price has gone up to $6.98 but hadn't updated the sign. The customer noticed the weight was 1.745 lbs and pointed it out. The employee tried to fix it by removing meat but ended up giving them an even smaller amount, which made the customer walk out.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving without saying anything. Let me break it down. \n\nFirst, the employee made a mistake in pricing and weight. The customer was right to notice the discrepancy. The employee tried to correct it by taking out meat, but ended up giving less than 1 lb, which is even worse. The customer was clearly frustrated, and the employee's actions probably contributed to that. \n\nThe customer could have tried to escalate the issue to a manager, but they chose not to. However, given the employee's confusion and incorrect handling, maybe the customer felt it was a lost cause. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author didn't steal anything; they just left the problematic meat. The employee was at fault for not only the pricing error but also miscalculating the weight. The customer's frustration is understandable. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for walking out after being mistreated by the employee who couldn't handle the situation properly. \n\nBut maybe the customer should have tried to speak to a manager or at least left a note. However, the author mentions they didn't want to be \"that guy\" and just wanted to buy groceries. It's possible the author felt it was a small amount and not worth the hassle, especially after the employee's handling made things worse. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The employee was the one making mistakes, and the customer's reaction, while abrupt, is a result of being treated poorly.\n"
