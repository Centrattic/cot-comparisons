She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter interaction where the customer ended up paying more than expected.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee sliced the meat, asked if it's okay if it's a bit over, and then charged $6.98/lb for 1.745lbs. The author noticed the discrepancy, pointed it out, and got into a conversation where the employee said the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. The employee then tried to rebag the meat, but the author walked out, leaving the employee confused.\n\nSo, the main points: the employee made an error in pricing, the author noticed and tried to correct it, but became frustrated. The employee tried to fix it but the author left without speaking to a manager.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let me think. The employee did make a mistake, and the author was polite initially. The employee's explanation about the price sign not being updated might have been confusing. The author's frustration is understandable because they were overcharged. However, leaving abruptly without resolving the issue might be seen as uncivil. The employee was trying to handle it, even if their method was clumsy. The author could have waited until the correct amount was given or at least said something to the manager. But the employee's actions\u2014like tearing up the meat and being dismissive\u2014might have contributed to the author's loss of patience.\n\nOn one hand, the author had a right to correct the pricing error. On the other, walking out without finishing the transaction could be considered rude. The employee was in the process of correcting the mistake. The author might have felt justified in leaving if they didn't want to deal with the confusion further, but not communicating that clearly left the employee in a lurch. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the store made the pricing error, so the employee was trying to rectify it. The author's reaction is a personal choice in a stressful moment. Whether it's the author's fault depends on whether they should have handled it more politely. The question is if the author is \"in the wrong,\" which implies if their actions were unreasonable. The employee was at fault for the pricing, but the author's abrupt exit might be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author wasn't necessarily wrong in walking out if they felt the situation was too much. \n\nHmm. I think the employee made the initial mistake, and the author was within their rights to challenge the incorrect charge. However, the author left without completing the transaction or communicating clearly. While the employee's actions were unprofessional, the author's response could be seen as impulsive. The correct approach would be to either wait for the corrected amount or leave politely, perhaps even speaking to a manager. Walking out in frustration without explanation could be considered inconsiderate, even if the employee was at fault. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong for not handling it more respectfully.\n"
