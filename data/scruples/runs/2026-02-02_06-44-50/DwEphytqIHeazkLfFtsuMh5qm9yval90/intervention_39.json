She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter where the customer ends up with a much more expensive and heavier meat than they asked for. The employee made a mistake in pricing, and when the customer pointed it out, the employee was unhelpful and even more so when the customer tried to address the weight issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the customer's actions. The customer initially asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745lbs priced at $6.98/lb. The customer noticed the error and politely mentioned it. The employee claimed the price had gone up but didn't check the weight. The customer then became irritated when the employee took the meat back, re-sliced it, but only put a few slices back, making it less than a pound. The customer then left without saying a word, abandoning the meat.\n\nNow, was the customer in the wrong? Well, the employee made a mistake in both price and weight. The customer tried to correct the price first, which the employee contested. Then the customer pointed out the weight was over 1.7lbs when they only asked for 1lb. The employee then tried to fix it by re-slicing, but the customer was clearly frustrated. The employee's behavior here is unprofessional and confusing. The customer's decision to leave might be seen as a reaction to the employee's incompetence. However, walking out without addressing the issue might be seen as not following up properly, like speaking to a manager. \n\nBut was the customer wrong? They were trying to get a simple purchase done. The employee's actions were causing unnecessary stress, and the customer might have felt it wasn't worth the hassle. The alternative is to get further into a conflict, which the customer didn't want. So maybe the customer isn't in the wrong because they were dealing with a confusing and incorrect transaction, and they chose to leave to avoid a confrontation. The employee's behavior was part of the problem. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
