She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is at a deli where the customer ends up leaving confused and upset. Let me break down what happened.\n\nFirst, the customer asked for 1lb of oven-roasted turkey at $3.98 per pound, thinly sliced. The employee sliced it, then asked if it was okay if it was a bit over. The customer agreed. Then the employee priced it at $12.18 for 1.745 lbs at $6.98 per pound. The customer pointed out the discrepancy in price and weight.\n\nThe employee said the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. The customer was concerned about the weight being over a pound. The employee then took the meat back, reweighed it by putting two slices and a half of another, resulting in a new weight and price. The customer left without saying anything else.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, the employee made a mistake in pricing. The sign was old, so the customer was charged the higher price without being informed. That's on the store. The customer noticed the weight was more than a pound, which the employee initially didn't address properly. The employee then tried to fix it by reducing the amount, which might have been a way to correct the weight but not the price. The customer was clearly frustrated and left without further interaction.\n\nFrom the customer's perspective, they were being overcharged due to a sign error and got more product than they asked for. The employee's response was dismissive, leading to the customer's irritation. The customer didn't confront the manager, which might have been a better approach, but they were just trying to get groceries.\n\nThe author's actions: they left without saying anything, which might come off as rude, but given the situation, they were trying to avoid a confrontation. The employee was unhelpful, and the store had the error. So the customer's frustration is justified. However, leaving without any communication could be seen as inconsiderate, but maybe not in the wrong. The real fault lies with the store for the pricing error and the employee's poor handling of the situation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
