She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for leaving the deli without resolving the pricing issue.\n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. The customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98 per pound. The employee gave them 1.745lbs but charged $6.98 per pound, which is almost triple the expected price. The customer points out the mistake, the employee says the price has increased but didn't update the sign. The customer is confused because they were told it was a bit over a pound but ended up with almost double the weight. The employee then starts rebagging, taking only a few slices and cutting one in half to make it weigh less. The customer, frustrated, leaves without paying the corrected amount.\n\nThe key points here are: the employee made a pricing error, possibly due to not updating the sign. The customer was initially polite, noticed the discrepancy, and tried to correct it. The employee's response was dismissive and then attempted to fix it by reducing the weight, which seems to be a way to charge the higher price for less product. The customer, overwhelmed by the employee's behavior and the confusion, left without resolving it.\n\nLegally, the customer is entitled to the correct price. The employee's error could be due to human mistake or negligence, but the customer's responsibility is to point it out. However, the customer in this case did point it out but felt the employee wasn't addressing it properly. The customer's reaction was to leave, which could be seen as abandoning the transaction. However, given the confusion and possible employee error, the customer might have a legitimate reason to be frustrated. \n\nIs the customer in the wrong? Well, by leaving without paying the correct amount, they might be avoiding the responsibility. But considering the employee's actions (changing the weight and price in a confusing manner), maybe the customer is just trying to get the right deal. The question is whether the customer's action of leaving is the asshole move. \n\nAlternatively, the employee is at fault for the pricing error and the way they handled the correction. The customer's impatience might be justified if the employee was being uncooperative. In some cases, leaving a problematic transaction isn't the worst thing, especially if the employee is not following procedures correctly. The customer might have the right to walk away if they feel they're not getting accurate service.\n\nSo, considering all that, the customer might not be in the wrong. The employee made the mistake and handled it poorly. The customer's frustration is understandable, and walking out could be a reasonable reaction to the confusing and possibly incorrect handling of the transaction. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
