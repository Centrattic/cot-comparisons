She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the story is about someone going to the deli and getting charged the wrong price for turkey meat. Let me break down the events step by step.\n\nFirst, the person asked for 1 pound of oven-roasted turkey at $3.98 per pound, thinly sliced. The deli worker made a mistake and charged them $6.98/lb for 1.745 pounds, totaling $12.18. The customer pointed this out politely, and the worker initially denied the mistake, claiming the price had gone up but the sign wasn't updated. Then, the worker asked if the weight being over was okay, which the customer agreed to. But the customer was actually confused because the weight was almost double what they asked for. The worker then tried to fix the issue by slicing the meat again, but the customer got frustrated and left without further discussion.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the actions of both parties. The deli worker made an error in pricing, which is understandable, but their response was problematic. They first denied the mistake, then tried to justify it by saying the price had changed. When the customer pointed out the weight issue, the worker didn't immediately correct it but instead tried to take the meat back and repackage it. The customer, already frustrated, left after the worker's actions seemed inefficient or possibly dismissive.\n\nFrom the customer's perspective, they tried to be polite and address the mistake. However, when the worker didn't resolve the issue satisfactorily, they left. The worker's behavior might have been unprofessional, not apologizing, and not immediately correcting the error. The customer's frustration is understandable given the situation. They didn't escalate it to a manager, which might have been another option, but leaving without paying could be seen as a problem. However, in some places, refusing to pay for an incorrect charge is a right, so the customer might have been within their rights to walk out if the store wouldn't correct the mistake.\n\nBut wait, did the customer actually not pay? The story says they left the basket on the ground and walked out. If they left without paying, that's theft. But the original post says they were holding a pile of meat without saying a word. Wait, the title says \"leaving a very confused deli girl holding a pile of meat without saying a word.\" So the customer took the meat and left, not paying? If that's the case, then the customer is in the wrong because they didn't pay for the item. But in the story, the customer was trying to resolve the pricing issue. The confusion comes from whether the customer paid or not. The post says they left the basket on the ground and walked out. If they left the basket, maybe that was a way to avoid confrontation but still didn't pay. If they didn't pay, then they are in the wrong. However, if they had already resolved the payment issue and just left the basket, then it's a different story. The key here is whether the customer paid for the correct amount or not. The original transaction was supposed to be for the correct price, but the worker charged more. The customer pointed it out, but the worker tried to repackage it. If the customer left before the correct payment was made, then they might be in the wrong. But if they were in the process of resolving it and left because the worker was being uncooperative, then maybe not. The line between standing up for oneself and being an asshole is thin here. The deli worker's behavior was unprofessional, but the customer's reaction was to walk out instead of escalating the issue. However, if the customer left without paying the correct amount, that's theft and they are in the wrong. The story says they left the basket on the ground and walked out. So if they didn't pay at all, that's theft. But the initial interaction suggests they were trying to correct the charge. The confusion is whether the customer took the meat without paying. If they did, that's their fault. But if they were in the process of resolving the issue and left because the worker was being difficult, maybe the worker is at fault. However, the correct procedure would be to either pay the correct amount or not take the item. So if the customer left without paying, even if the worker was wrong, they are in the wrong. The answer likely is A, the author is in the wrong because they left without properly resolving the payment issue.\n"
