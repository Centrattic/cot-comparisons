She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves a deli employee making a mistake with the pricing and weight of the meat, and the author's reaction to it.\n\nFirst, the author went to the deli and asked for 1 lb of turkey meat at $3.98/lb, thinly sliced. The employee sliced it, asked if it was okay if it was a bit over, and the author agreed. However, the employee then priced it at $6.98/lb for 1.745 lbs, totaling $12.18. The author pointed out the discrepancy, and the employee explained the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. The author then noted the weight was over 1.7 lbs, which the employee didn't seem to acknowledge. The employee started rebagging by taking out slices and cutting them to reduce the weight and price. The author became irritated, put down their basket, and left without resolving the issue.\n\nNow, the key points here are the employee's actions and the author's reaction. The employee admitted the price was higher but didn't correct the weight issue. The author is correct in pointing out the weight discrepancy. The employee then tried to rebag by removing slices and cutting them, which might be a way to reduce the total weight. However, the author's response was to walk out, not pay, and not address the issue with a manager.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The employee made mistakes, but the author left without resolving the problem. The author could have either paid the correct price if they accepted the new price and weight or asked for the correct amount at the original price. By walking out, the author didn't follow through with the transaction, possibly leaving the employee confused or responsible for the item. The author's frustration is understandable, but leaving without resolving the issue might be seen as inconsiderate. However, the employee's initial mistake and refusal to acknowledge the weight issue might justify the author's actions. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the employee was at fault for the pricing and weight error. The author's immediate reaction might be impulsive, but the employee's response (rebagging by cutting slices) could be a way to correct the weight. If the author left without paying, they might be leaving the employee stuck with the meat. However, the author might have felt that the employee wasn't handling the situation properly and wanted to avoid further conflict. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's action, while impulsive, might be a justified reaction to poor customer service. The employee's mistakes led to the situation, so the author isn't entirely in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
