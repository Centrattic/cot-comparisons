She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for leaving the deli counter situation without resolving it. The story is from a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole?\" post.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author asked for 1lb of oven roasted turkey meat at $3.98 per lb, thinly sliced. The deli employee gave them 1.745 lbs at the higher price of $6.98. The author noticed the discrepancy, politely pointed it out, but the employee insisted there was no mistake, even after the author mentioned the weight. The employee then tried to rebag the meat by cutting it down, but the author left without saying a word, not wanting to escalate by talking to a manager.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. The question is whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong. The answer is either A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nSo, considering the facts: The author is a customer who was overcharged. They tried to address the issue politely, but the employee was dismissive and incorrect about the price. The employee then attempted to fix the weight by cutting up slices, which might not be accurate. The author, frustrated, left without further confrontation. \n\nIn such scenarios, the usual advice is to escalate when necessary. But the author chose to leave. The key points are the employee's mistake in pricing and weight, and the author's reaction. The employee's behavior was unprofessional; they should have known the correct price and handled the situation better. The author's right to question the overcharge is valid. However, leaving without resolving it might be seen as not standing up for oneself, but the author wasn't being confrontational. They just couldn't deal with the employee's attitude. \n\nIn terms of morality, the author isn't in the wrong because the employee made an error. The author's frustration is understandable. They tried to correct it politely, and when that failed, they walked out. The employee's responsibility is to correct the mistake, not to guilt-trip the customer. The author's action, while abrupt, is not unethical. They're not obligated to stay and argue if they feel it's a lost cause. The real issue is the employee's poor customer service and pricing error. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
