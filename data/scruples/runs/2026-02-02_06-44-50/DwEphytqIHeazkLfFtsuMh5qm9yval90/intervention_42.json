She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter interaction where the customer left without resolving the pricing issue.\n\nFirst, the customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98 per pound. The employee provided 1.745 lbs priced at $6.98 per pound. The customer points out the mistake, the employee corrects the weight but charges the higher price. The customer then leaves without saying a word, leaving the employee confused.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know the opinion. I need to determine if the author's actions were appropriate.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the customer handle the situation correctly? The customer noticed the error, tried to correct it, and when the employee was unhelpful, they left. Is that reasonable?\n\nThe employee might have made a mistake in pricing or weight. The customer tried to resolve it but became frustrated. Walking out might be seen as impolite, but maybe justified if the employee wasn't cooperating. However, the customer could have tried to speak to a manager or left a note. Just walking out might be considered inconsiderate, but given the employee's confusion, maybe the customer was right to not engage further.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the customer wasn't in the wrong for noticing the error. The employee's mistake is on them. However, the customer's reaction of leaving abruptly could be seen as inconsiderate. The question is whether the customer's response was unreasonable. If the author left without addressing the issue, maybe they could have handled it better, but the employee's mistake was the root cause. The author's frustration is understandable, but walking out might be seen as not trying to resolve it properly. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not attempting to resolve it, like speaking to a manager. Alternatively, the employee's confusion might have been genuine, so the author's action was a reasonable response to a stressful situation. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They tried to address the issue, but when the employee didn't cooperate, they left. The mistake was the deli's, and the author's frustration is valid. The employee's confusion might have been real, and the author didn't owe it to the store to deal with their error. So the author isn't the asshole.\n"
