She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter interaction where the customer left without resolving a pricing discrepancy.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745lbs but charged $6.98/lb. The customer noticed the mistake, pointed it out, and the employee tried to adjust by taking out meat and weighing it again. The customer then left without paying the correct amount.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the customer was wrong for leaving without resolving the overcharge. The employee made a mistake in pricing and quantity, but the customer, after a tense exchange, walked out. Legally, the customer paid what they thought was the correct amount, but the store overcharged them. If the customer left without addressing it, they might be avoiding the overcharge, which could be seen as unethical or dishonest, even if the employee was at fault. However, the customer was clearly frustrated and felt wronged, so their impatience might be understandable. But ethically, isn't the customer still responsible to pay the correct amount once they're made aware? The employee admitted the price had increased but didn't adjust the quantity. The customer had the option to pay the correct price or challenge it further. By leaving without clarification, the customer might be considered in the wrong because they didn't resolve the issue properly. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
