She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is the asshole (AITA) for leaving the deli girl confused with a pile of meat. The key points here are the interaction at the deli, the price discrepancy, and the author's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author ordered 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The deli employee gave them 1.745lbs priced at $6.98/lb. The author noticed the mistake, pointed it out, and the employee claimed the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then, when the author pointed out the weight was over a pound, the employee became defensive, took the meat back, and tried to repackage it by taking out slices and tearing them to reduce the weight. The author then left without saying anything else.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know the community's opinion. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong).\n\nSo, who's at fault here? The employee made a pricing mistake, then handled the situation poorly. The author tried to correct the mistake but got an unhelpful response. The employee then tried to fix it by altering the product, which seems inappropriate. The author's frustration is understandable, but walking out without resolving the issue or escalating to a manager might be seen as avoiding responsibility or being rude.\n\nHowever, the employee's behavior was unprofessional. She didn't acknowledge the mistake properly and tried to manipulate the product in front of the customer. The author's patience was lost, which is a common reaction in stressful situations. The question is whether the author had the right to leave without addressing it further.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the employee was in the wrong for the initial mistake and poor handling. The author's reaction was a result of the employee's actions. The author could have asked to speak to a manager, but they chose to leave. Depending on cultural norms, some might say the author should have stayed and resolved it, while others might empathize with the frustration.\n\nSince the author didn't engage in an argument or cause a scene but left in frustration, the question is whether that's acceptable. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because the employee's behavior was unprofessional, and the author's reaction was a result of that. So, answer B (not in the wrong).\n"
