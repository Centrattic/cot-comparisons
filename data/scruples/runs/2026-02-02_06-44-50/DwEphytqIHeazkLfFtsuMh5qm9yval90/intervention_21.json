She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl without saying a word after a confusing interaction. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author asked for 1 lb of turkey at $3.98/lb, but was given 1.745 lbs priced at $6.98/lb. The employee initially said the price had increased but hadn't updated the sign. The author pointed out the weight discrepancy, and the employee took the meat, re-measured it, and ended up giving a much smaller portion. The author then left without speaking further.\n\nSo, the key points here. The employee made a mistake in the price and the weight. The author noticed and tried to correct it. The employee then tried to fix it by giving a smaller portion, but the author walked out. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author's main argument is that they lost patience and didn't want to escalate by talking to a manager. They just wanted to buy groceries and left in frustration.\n\nFrom the employee's perspective, she made errors\u2014first in price, then in weight. She tried to correct it by giving a smaller amount, maybe thinking it would be closer to 1 lb. But the way she handled it (tearing slices, etc.) might have been unprofessional or confusing. The author's reaction was to leave, not to confront her further.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong: The author was a customer who noticed a mistake and tried to address it. The employee was at fault for the errors. The author's frustration is understandable. However, the author walked out without resolving the issue, which could be seen as not giving the employee a chance to fix it properly. But considering the employee was already confused and making mistakes, maybe the author felt it was futile.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Maybe not necessarily. They were in a situation where they were being overcharged and given more than the requested amount. When corrected, the employee tried to adjust but didn't seem to handle it well. The author might have felt it was a losing battle and just wanted to leave. While walking out without further discussion isn't the most constructive response, the employee's errors and the chaotic handling of the situation might justify the author's actions. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong).\n"
