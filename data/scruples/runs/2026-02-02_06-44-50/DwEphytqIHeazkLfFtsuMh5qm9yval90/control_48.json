She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the story (AITA) is in the wrong for leaving the deli without resolving the pricing issue.\n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The person went to the deli, ordered a specific amount of meat at a certain price. The employee made a mistake in pricing, charging them nearly double. The customer pointed out the error, but the employee was dismissive or confused. The customer then left without resolving it, not even mentioning the weight discrepancy again.\n\nSo, the main points are: the employee's mistake, the customer's reaction, and the decision to leave. \n\nThe employee first said the price went up but didn't update the sign. Then, when the customer pointed out the weight was over a pound, the employee didn't acknowledge the weight issue, just took the meat back and rebagged it with only a few slices. The customer got frustrated and left.\n\nNow, is the customer the asshole? Well, the employee made a pricing error. The customer correctly noticed it and tried to point it out. The employee's response was to question the customer's observation, which is unprofessional. The customer then tries to explain but eventually gives up. \n\nLeaving without resolving the issue might be seen as not trying to fix the problem. However, the customer was polite, tried to address it, and the employee was uncooperative. The customer might have felt that escalating the issue (like talking to a manager) was too much effort. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the employee was at fault for the error and not properly addressing it. The customer tried to resolve it but gave up when the employee wasn't helpful. So the customer isn't in the wrong. They had a valid reason to be upset. The answer should be B (No).\n"
