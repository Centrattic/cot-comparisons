She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused after an interaction. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author goes to the deli, asks for 1lb of turkey at $3.98 per pound. The employee gives them 1.745 lbs, but charged at $6.98 per pound. The author points out the discrepancy, the employee claims the price increased but didn't update the sign. The author is upset because the weight is more than they asked for, and the price is way higher. The employee then takes back the meat, starts rebagging it by putting in 2 slices, tearing another in half, etc. The author then leaves without saying anything, feeling they lost patience.\n\nFirst, the employee made an error in pricing and weight. The author is correct in pointing out the mistake. The employee tried to explain that the price increased but didn't adjust the sign, but the author was confused because they were quoted $3.98. The weight being almost two pounds when they asked for one is another issue. The employee then attempts to fix it, but in a way that seems haphazard\u2014just taking slices and tearing them. The author is frustrated and leaves.\n\nNow, the author's actions: they didn't confront the manager, didn't explain further, just left. Is this wrong? Well, in such situations, the expected norm is to either resolve the issue (like getting a correct price and amount) or, if you can't, to at least inform the employee or manager. The author left the employee confused with the meat, which could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the employee's behavior was unprofessional\u2014overcharging and not properly addressing the issue. The author's frustration is understandable. \n\nBut by leaving without resolving or communicating, the author might be seen as not upholding their part in trying to resolve the conflict. However, the employee's actions were the initial problem. The author had the right to point out the mistake and then, if they're not happy with the resolution, leave. However, leaving the employee with the meat without any explanation could be seen as poor customer service etiquette, but given the employee's errors, maybe it's justified. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether their reaction is proportionate. The employee made a mistake and tried to fix it in a way that didn't satisfy the author. The author's decision to leave might be seen as not taking the proper steps (like talking to a manager), but given the irritation and the employee's behavior, maybe it's understandable. The key here is that the author was correct in pointing out the error, and the employee was at fault. The author's leaving might not be the worst thing, especially if they felt it was a lost cause. So, probably the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
