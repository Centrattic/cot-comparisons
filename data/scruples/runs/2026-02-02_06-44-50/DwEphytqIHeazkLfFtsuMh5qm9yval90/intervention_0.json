She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is the asshole for leaving the deli girl confused after a pricing discrepancy.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author went to the deli, asked for 1lb of turkey meat at $3.98/lb. The employee sliced it, said it's a bit over, got permission, then priced it at $6.98/lb for 1.745lbs totaling $12.18. The author noticed the price was higher and the weight was over a pound, so they politely pointed it out. The employee corrected that the price increased but didn't update the sign, then the author explains the weight is over. The employee then takes the meat, starts rebagging it by weighing slices, which the author found irritating. The author walks out without speaking to a manager or escalating the issue.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the employee made a pricing error and a weight error. The author tried to point out the weight issue first, and the employee was trying to fix it by rebagging. The author's irritation seems to stem from the employee's method of handling the correction (tearing meat, etc.). They left without further communication.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious. From a customer service perspective, when there's a mistake, it's important for the employee to correct it. The author was trying to get the correct price and weight. The employee's actions of rebagging might have been causing the author to lose patience. The author didn't escalate, which could be seen as avoiding conflict, but maybe they did the right thing by not engaging further with an inefficient employee. However, the act of leaving the employee holding the meat without a word might be considered rude. The employee is doing their job, albeit poorly, and the author could have waited or asked for help in a better way. \n\nBut also, the employee might be overwhelmed or inexperienced. The author's frustration is understandable because the price was double what they expected. However, walking out without a word could be seen as abandoning the employee, who might be confused or need to know where the customer went. The author could have at least said they were leaving or asked for a manager, but they chose not to. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not handling it more politely. \n\nAlternatively, the author might have felt that the employee wasn't helpful and just wanted to get out of the situation. The line \"looked right through her dead eyes\" suggests the author was frustrated. In that case, the author's actions were a result of the employee's mistakes and the situation being too stressful. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's reaction is justified. The employee was trying to correct the mistake, but maybe in a clumsy way. The author could have been more patient, but if the employee was inexperienced and the process was taking too long, maybe the author's reaction isn't entirely wrong. However, the act of just walking out without any communication is probably unkind. So the author might be in the wrong for how they left the situation without giving the employee a chance to resolve it properly. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n"
