She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is they went to a deli, asked for 1lb of turkey meat at $3.98 per pound, but the deli girl gave them 1.745lbs priced at $6.98. The author points out the mistake, the deli girl says the price increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then the author gets more upset when the weight is over a pound, the girl takes it back, cuts it down, and the author leaves without saying anything.\n\nFirst, the deli girl made an error in the price. The author correctly noticed that the price per pound was higher than expected. The girl's response that the price increased but the sign wasn't changed is a bit of an excuse. However, maybe the author is overreacting? They mention the slices are half as thick as a DVD case, which might not be a standard measure, but maybe the thickness is part of the issue. The deli girl then starts to rebag, taking out the meat and putting 2 slices and half another, which seems like she's trying to reduce the weight to match the 1lb the customer asked for. The author walks out, not dealing with the situation further.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the deli girl was in the process of correcting the mistake. The author didn't wait for the correction and left without resolving the issue. The author was polite initially, but when the deli girl tried to fix it, maybe they were a bit abrupt. However, the deli girl might have been the one at fault for not explaining properly. The author's frustration is understandable because they were overcharged. But instead of letting the deli girl fix it, they left. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't allow the deli girl to correct the mistake, even if the staff was confused. The correct action might have been to let her finish adjusting the price and then proceed. Alternatively, if the deli girl was trying to shortchange the customer by cutting the meat, that's another issue. But the author left before the correction was made. So, maybe the author is not in the wrong because the initial mistake was the store's fault, and the deli girl was trying to correct it in a way that could be confusing. The author just wanted to get the correct amount and price, and maybe the interaction became too stressful. It's a bit of a toss-up, but I think the author acted out of frustration, which is common. However, leaving without resolving it might not be the best approach. The deli girl was trying to fix the problem, so the author could have waited. Therefore, the answer might be A, but I'm not sure. Wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the deli girl was trying to correct her mistake and the author walked out, maybe the author is in the wrong for not giving her a chance to fix it properly. Alternatively, the deli girl's actions were causing confusion, and the author just couldn't handle it anymore. In that case, the answer would be B. I need to weigh the responsibility here. The store made an error, the deli girl was trying to fix it, but the author left. The author's actions might prevent the deli girl from fixing the mistake, so they might be in the wrong. On the other hand, the deli girl's method of correcting by tearing meat could be unsanitary or not what the customer wanted. The author might have a right to leave if they don't want to accept that method. Maybe it's a no-calls situation. The sign was incorrect, but the actual price was higher, so the deli girl was trying to adjust the weight. Maybe the author should have waited for the correct amount and price. But if the deli girl was trying to cut the weight down by tearing meat, perhaps that's not appropriate. The author might have been justified in leaving because the deli girl wasn't providing a clear solution. Hmm. This is tricky. I think the key points are: the customer was correct to point out the price discrepancy, the deli girl made a mistake, and then tried to correct it. The customer left before the correction was completed. The deli girl might have been trying to do her job, but the customer's frustration is valid. The author probably isn't the asshole here because the store was at fault, and the customer had the right to leave if they couldn't handle the situation. So answer B: No.\n"
