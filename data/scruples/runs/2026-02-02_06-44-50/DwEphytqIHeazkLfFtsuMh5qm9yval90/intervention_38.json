She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter interaction where the customer ends up with an overpriced and overweighed product, and then leaves without saying anything.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb, but the employee gave them 1.745lbs at $6.98/lb. The customer pointed out the mistake, the employee initially denied it, then tried to fix it by reducing the amount, but the customer left in frustration without speaking further.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the employee make a mistake? Yes, it seems like the price was higher than the sign indicated. The customer noticed the error and tried to correct it. The employee then took the product back and tried to fix it by reducing the amount. The customer left without finishing the interaction.\n\nNow, the question is whether the customer is in the wrong. The customer didn't confront the manager or make a formal complaint, which might be seen as not addressing the issue properly. But the customer was also visibly irritated and left without clarification. \n\nOn one hand, the customer could be seen as not following up to ensure the problem was resolved. By leaving, they might have abandoned the situation without getting a proper resolution, which could be seen as uncaring or not using the proper channels. \n\nOn the other hand, the customer was trying to be polite initially. The employee's behavior (denying the mistake, then trying to fix it by cutting slices) might have been confusing or frustrating. The customer might have felt that continuing the interaction was pointless or that they didn't want to escalate the situation further. \n\nAlso, the fact that the employee didn't correct the price but instead corrected the weight (which might not resolve the issue if the higher price is still applied) could be a problem. If the price was wrong, the correct fix would be to charge the lower rate, not just reduce the weight. The customer might have realized that even after reducing the weight, the employee was still charging the higher price, leading to frustration.\n\nSo, the customer's actions could be seen as a reaction to the employee's incorrect handling of the mistake. They might have felt that continuing the interaction was futile, especially if the employee was not following proper procedures. However, by not addressing the issue with a manager or seeking a resolution, they might be missing an opportunity to correct the problem.\n\nIn the end, whether the customer is in the wrong depends on if they had a duty to follow up. Since the store made a pricing error, the customer is entitled to the correct price. By leaving without ensuring that the issue was resolved, they might be in the wrong for not taking steps to correct the mistake. Alternatively, if the employee was the one at fault for multiple errors, the customer might feel justified in leaving after a point.\n\nBut given that the customer pointed out the mistake, the employee tried to fix it but didn't resolve the core issue (the price), and the customer left without a resolution, the customer might be in the wrong for not pushing the issue further. However, it's also possible that the customer is not in the wrong because the employee was being uncooperative, and the customer didn't want to escalate it. \n\nI think the main issue is that the customer didn't complete the interaction to ensure the problem was fixed. Even if they were frustrated, leaving without addressing the issue might leave the problem unsolved. So the answer might be A (Yes, the customer is in the wrong). But I'm a bit conflicted because the employee's behavior was also problematic.\n"
