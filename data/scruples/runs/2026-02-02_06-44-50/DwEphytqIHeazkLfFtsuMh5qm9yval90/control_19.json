She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused without saying a word.\n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The author went to a deli, asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98 per pound, thinly sliced. The employee gave them 1.745lbs at $6.98, which is a significant price difference. The author pointed out the mistake, and the employee claimed the price had increased but hadn't updated the sign. The author was frustrated because the weight was over a pound, and the employee took out the meat to repackage. The author then left without saying a word, feeling that the employee was inconsiderate.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the employee made a pricing error, the author noticed and tried to correct it, there was a misunderstanding about the weight and price, and the employee's response was to repackage the meat in a way the author found unsatisfactory. The author then left in frustration.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The employee was the one who made the mistake in pricing and then tried to correct it, but perhaps not in a way that satisfied the author. The author tried to point out the error politely and then left when the situation escalated. The author didn't confront the manager but decided to walk out. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the employee had a responsibility to provide accurate pricing. The author was a customer trying to get the correct product. The author's frustration is understandable given the discrepancy. However, walking out without attempting to resolve it further (like talking to the manager) might be seen as a lack of follow-through. But considering the interaction, the author did try to address the issue. The employee's actions (tearing meat, etc.) might have been unprofessional, leading the author to lose patience.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's debatable. They didn't act aggressively, just left. The employee was the one who made the error and perhaps mishandled the correction. The author's frustration is valid, and their choice to leave rather than escalate further is a personal decision. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), as the author isn't in the wrong for reacting to a problematic interaction.\n"
