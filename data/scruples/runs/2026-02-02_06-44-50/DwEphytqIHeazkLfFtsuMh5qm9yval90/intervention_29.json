She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused and without saying a word. The situation involves a price discrepancy and a weight issue.\n\nFirst, the author asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The deli employee gave them 1.745lbs priced at $6.98/lb. The author pointed out the mistake, the employee said the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then the author noticed the weight was more than a pound, and the employee had asked if it's okay if it's a little over. \n\nWait, the employee initially said it's a little over, but then the weight was 1.745lbs. The author is confused because they were expecting maybe a bit over 1lb but not almost double. The employee tried to correct it by putting 2 slices and tearing another, making the weight less. The author then left without speaking to a manager.\n\nSo, the author's actions were to confront the employee, noticed the weight issue, and when the employee tried to fix it by reducing the amount, the author left. The key points are whether the author was justified in leaving abruptly. \n\nThe employee made a mistake in both price and weight. The author tried to address it, but the employee was uncooperative, maybe defensive. The author felt that going to the manager would be too much, so they left. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, employees can make mistakes, but the employee's response was dismissive. The author's frustration is understandable. However, by leaving without resolving it, maybe they didn't handle it properly. But considering the employee's behavior, maybe the author had reason to walk out. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions might be seen as impulsive, but the situation was stressful. The employee wasn't helpful, so the author's decision to leave could be excusable. However, not speaking to a manager might mean the issue wasn't resolved, but the author didn't want to escalate. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. I think the main fault lies with the employee for the error and not handling the situation well. The author did point out the mistake and was polite. When the employee tried to correct it by reducing the amount, the author left. So, the author might not be in the wrong because they tried to address it, but maybe they could have handled it better. However, the situation was tense, so leaving might be understandable. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
