She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli employee who made a pricing mistake and the author left without saying anything.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author asked for 1lb of oven roasted turkey meat at $3.98 per lb. The employee sliced it thinly, said it's okay if it's a little over, and then charged $12.18 for 1.745 lbs at $6.98. The author noticed the error and pointed it out, the employee acknowledged the price was higher and hadn't updated the sign. The dispute was about the weight, but the employee took the meat, reweighed with two slices and half of another, then handed it back. The author then left without confronting further.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to leave the employee confused. Let's think about the key points. The employee made a mistake, possibly overcharged for the meat and the weight. The author tried to point out the error, and the employee corrected it, but maybe the author could have handled it more politely. \n\nThe author says they were \"audibly irritated\" when pointing out the weight. Then when the employee tried to correct it by taking it back, the author left without saying anything else. The employee might have been confused because the author didn't even take the corrected amount or pay the right price. The author walked out leaving the employee with the meat and basket.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the main issue is whether the author should have dealt with the situation in a more respectful way. While the employee made a mistake, the author's reaction of leaving without resolution could be seen as inconsiderate. The employee might have been overcharged for the meat, or maybe the weight was incorrect. The author had a valid reason to question the price and weight, but leaving without clarifying or returning later might be seen as not being the asshole (ITA) because they caught the error and the employee corrected it. However, the author's immediate reaction could have been more polite. \n\nBut the employee did correct the mistake after the author pointed it out. The author might have been frustrated and didn't want to escalate the situation with the manager. However, leaving without saying anything after the employee tried to fix it could be seen as not being helpful. The employee might have been left unsure if the problem was resolved. \n\nOn the other hand, if the employee corrected the mistake, the author would have paid the correct price and left. The author walked out when the employee tried to correct the weight by giving less meat. The employee might have been trying to resolve the issue, but the author didn't accept the corrected amount. Maybe the author wanted the 1lb as ordered and the employee was giving less, so the author left to avoid being undercharged. \n\nWait, the original request was for 1lb. The price tag was 1.745lbs at $6.98. The employee took the meat, then put 2 slices and a half of another, which is less. But the author left the basket and the corrected amount there. So the employee might have ended up with a bag of meat they tried to correct but the author didn't take it. The employee could be left with the meat, and the author didn't even pay for the corrected amount. So the author didn't actually take the meat but left. \n\nIn that case, the author didn't pay for anything, just left the employee confused. The employee made a mistake, the author pointed it out, the employee tried to fix it by giving less, but the author didn't take it and walked out. So the author's action might be seen as not bad because they were right to question the mistake. However, the way they left might have been abrupt and left the employee in a worse position. \n\nBut the employee's behavior was confusing. They first said the price had gone up but the sign wasn't updated. Then they corrected the weight by reducing the amount, but the author left. The author might have felt that the price was still wrong (from $3.98 to $6.98) or that the weight was not as ordered. \n\nThe author could have been in the right to point out the error and then refused the overcharged product. If the employee corrected it by giving less meat, the author could have taken that or asked to get the correct amount and price. But they didn't. They just left. \n\nSo the author's action of leaving might not be the asshole, as they were trying to get the correct price and amount. However, the way they did it (audibly irritated, leaving the basket, and not communicating) could be seen as inconsiderate. The employee was doing their job and making a mistake, which is understandable. The author's frustration is valid, but the response of just walking out might be seen as harsh. \n\nThe key is whether the author was wrong to not handle it more professionally. The employee was trying to correct the mistake, but the author didn't accept the corrected amount and left. The author could have said, \"Thanks for correcting it, but I still want the correct price for 1lb as per the original sign,\" and then walked out. But instead, they left after the employee tried to adjust the weight, which might have been the correct action if the weight was still wrong. \n\nWait, the employee initially gave 1.745lbs, but the author wanted 1lb. Then the employee took back the meat and gave 2.5 slices (assuming 5-6 slices before, then 2 and a half). If the original sign said $3.98 per lb, and the price was changed to $6.98 but the sign wasn't updated, the author was right to question it. The employee's correction to the weight (1.745 to whatever the new weight was after removing slices) might not have addressed the price issue. The author might have wanted the meat at the original price or the correct price. \n\nBut if the employee corrected the weight to 1lb (if the original request was 1lb), then the author could have taken it. However, the employee might have been overcompensating by reducing the amount. The author's frustration was about the price and the weight. \n\nIn the end, the author left the employee with the meat and basket, not paying for the corrected amount. So the employee might have to deal with the error, but the author didn't escalate to the manager. The author's action of leaving could be seen as not the asshole because they were right to challenge the mistake, but the manner of leaving might have been inconsiderate. \n\nAlternatively, the employee's mistake was in the pricing, not the weight. The author was correct in pointing out that the sign was wrong. The employee said the price went up, but maybe the author could have asked for the 1lb at the higher price. But the employee charged for 1.745lbs at $6.98, which is more than the original $3.98 per lb. So the author was right to question both the price and the weight. \n\nThe employee's response of \"where does it say that?\" when the author mentions the weight might have been dismissive. The author was irritated, which is understandable. Then the employee tried to fix the weight by giving less meat, but the author left. \n\nIf the employee corrected the mistake by giving the correct amount and the correct price (maybe 1lb at $6.98), then the author left without taking it. But the author might have felt that the price was still incorrect. However, the employee had already acknowledged the price was higher, just the sign wasn't updated. So maybe the correct price is $6.98 per lb, and the weight was still 1lb. The original request was 1lb at $3.98, but the real price is now $6.98. The author might have wanted to buy the meat at the old price or not take it because the price was higher. \n\nIn that case, the author's action of leaving after the employee corrected the weight but not the price might be justified. However, the author's frustration and the abrupt exit could be seen as unkind. \n\nBut since the employee was at fault for the mistake (price and weight), the author's reaction might be more about being fed up and not wanting to deal with the hassle. The author didn't escalate to the manager, which could be a more appropriate action. \n\nSo, the author's main issue was the employee's mistake. The employee corrected the weight, but maybe not the price. The author left, which might be seen as not the asshole. However, the way they handled it (audibly irritated, leaving the basket) might be considered inconsiderate, but not necessarily in the wrong. Because the root of the problem was the employee's error. The author's action of pointing it out and leaving might be justified. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
