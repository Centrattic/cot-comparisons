She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is at a deli where the customer got overcharged and then walked out without saying anything to the employee.\n\nFirst, the customer ordered 1lb of turkey at $3.98 per pound. The employee gave them 1.745 lbs but charged $6.98 per pound, which is way over the original price. The customer pointed out the mistake, but the employee was dismissive, took the meat back, and tried to fix it by putting in fewer slices. The customer got frustrated, left the basket, and walked out.\n\nSo, the main points here: the employee made a pricing error, didn't correct it when the customer pointed it out, and then tried to adjust the amount instead of the price. The customer, after being polite, lost patience and left. The question is whether the customer is in the wrong for not speaking to a manager or just leaving.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The customer did approach the situation politely first, pointed out the mistake, and the employee didn't handle it properly. The customer might have felt that the employee was not being honest, especially after the price was mentioned as $6.98, which was higher than the sign. The customer might have been concerned about being overcharged intentionally. \n\nWalking out without resolving the issue could be seen as rude, especially if there was a misunderstanding. But in this case, the employee didn't seem to be in the right. The customer was trying to correct the error but was met with defensiveness. The customer might have felt that escalating to a manager would be necessary, but maybe they didn't want to make a scene. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the employee's actions (incorrect pricing, not acknowledging the mistake, and then trying to adjust the weight instead of the price) might have justified the customer's frustration. The customer didn't yell or be aggressive; they just left. So maybe the customer isn't in the wrong because they tried to address it politely and then left when it wasn't resolved. The employee could be at fault for not handling the customer's concern properly. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of not following through. The customer didn't resolve the issue, didn't get a refund, and left the employee with the problem. However, the customer might have felt that the employee wasn't being honest, so they preferred to leave rather than be overcharged. \n\nI think the key point is that the customer tried to resolve it politely, and when that failed, they left. The employee's actions were the main issue here. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
