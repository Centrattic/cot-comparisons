She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter where the customer ended up with the wrong price and weight of meat and then left without saying a word.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the sequence of events. The customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The deli employee sliced it, checked if it's okay if it's a bit over, and then charged $6.98/lb for 1.745 lbs, totaling $12.18. The customer pointed out the mistake, the employee insisted the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then the customer said the weight was over a pound, and the employee questioned where that was stated. The customer got more irritated, the employee tried to fix it by putting fewer slices, but the customer left.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the question is whether that's accurate. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the employee made a pricing error. The customer correctly noticed the discrepancy. The employee was uncooperative, maybe even dishonest (changing the amount without fixing the price). The customer, frustrated, walked out. \n\nNow, the main question is whether the customer was in the wrong for leaving without a word or escalating the issue. \n\nOn one hand, the customer had a right to be concerned about being overcharged. The employee's behavior (arguing, not being clear, changing the amount in a confusing way) could be unprofessional. The customer might have felt that escalating to a manager wouldn't help or that it was a lost cause. \n\nOn the other hand, the customer didn't communicate their issue further, didn't return to resolve it, and just left. This could be seen as not trying to resolve the matter properly. However, the customer also might have felt that the employee wasn't addressing the problem correctly, and maybe the customer's frustration was justified. \n\nBut according to AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, the customer might be expected to at least attempt to resolve the issue, even if they were frustrated. Walking out without a word could be seen as abandoning the problem instead of addressing it. However, if the employee was being uncooperative, the customer might have felt it was a lost cause. \n\nIn some AITA cases, walking out without trying to resolve it is seen as not taking responsibility or trying to fix the situation. The customer could have at least asked to speak to a manager or left the item there. But since the customer left the deli, maybe they intended to not return, but they might still be in the wrong for not following up. \n\nAlternatively, the employee made a mistake and then handled it poorly, so the customer's frustration is understandable. However, the customer's action of just leaving without a word might be the asshole move because they didn't try to correct the error. \n\nSo, the answer could be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't try to resolve it. But some might argue B (no) because the employee was uncooperative. But AITA usually sides with the idea that you should at least make an effort to resolve the issue, even if you're frustrated. \n\nI think the answer is A. The customer didn't follow through to fix the problem, even if the employee was at fault. The customer's action of leaving without a word or trying to get a resolution is the asshole part.\n"
