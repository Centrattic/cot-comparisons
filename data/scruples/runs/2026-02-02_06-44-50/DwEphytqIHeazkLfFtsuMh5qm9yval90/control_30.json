She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused after a pricing and weight issue.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author ordered 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The deli employee gave them 1.745lbs priced at $6.98/lb. The customer pointed out the discrepancy, the employee said the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. The customer then mentioned the weight being over a pound. The employee questioned where that was stated, then tried to rebag it by cutting slices. The author left without finishing the interaction.\n\nSo, the key points here: The customer is paying for the product, and there's a clear mistake in price and weight. The employee seems to have made an error, possibly in pricing or weighing. The customer tried to point this out politely but became frustrated. The employee's response was confusing and possibly incorrect. The customer left without resolving it, which might be seen as rude, but considering the employee's actions, maybe it's understandable.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the employee made a mistake. The customer tried to address it, but the employee was dismissive. The customer's reaction was to leave, which is a personal choice. While not completing the transaction or speaking to a manager might be seen as not following up, the situation was frustrating. The author didn't yell or\u8fb1\u9a82, just left. So, probably not the wrong. The employee was at fault for the mistake and the confusing response. The customer's frustration is valid. So answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
