She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for leaving a confused deli worker with a pile of meat without talking. The situation is a bit of a mix-up.\n\nFirst, the user asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98, but the deli girl charged $6.98 per pound. The user noticed the price was wrong and pointed it out. The deli girl explained the price had gone up but didn't update the sign. Then the user mentioned the weight was over 1.7 pounds, and the girl tried to adjust by cutting slices. The user got frustrated and walked out.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? The user did point out the mistake politely. The deli worker might have made an error in pricing or was confused. When the user said the weight was almost two pounds, the worker took it from them and tried to fix it, but maybe she miscalculated. The user then left the meat, possibly leaving her in a tough spot. But the user was trying to correct the weight and price. The worker's job is to handle these transactions correctly. The user's frustration might be justified if the worker wasn't resolving the issue properly. However, leaving the meat without saying anything could be seen as abandoning their responsibility. They might need to inform her that they can't take the product at that price and weight. Alternatively, maybe the user should have waited for her to correct it. The key points are whether the user acted politely and whether the worker was at fault for the mistake. The user's actions led to a resolution attempt, but walking out might not be the best approach. So, the answer might be A (the user is in the wrong) because they left the situation unresolved and the worker was trying to fix it. But others might argue the worker was not handling it well, so the user's reaction is understandable. Hmm.\n"
