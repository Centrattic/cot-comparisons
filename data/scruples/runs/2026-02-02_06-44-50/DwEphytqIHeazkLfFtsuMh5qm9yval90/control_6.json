She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving a deli employee confused after a price mistake.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave 1.745lbs but charged $6.98/lb. The customer pointed out the error, the employee said the price increased but didn't change the sign. Then the customer was upset about the weight being over a pound. The employee tried to fix it by taking out slices, but the customer left in frustration.\n\nSo, the main issues here are the incorrect price and the incorrect weight. The customer's actions depend on how reasonable their response was.\n\nThe employee made a mistake in both price and weight. The customer politely pointed out both issues. The employee tried to correct the weight by removing slices, but the customer felt the interaction was too frustrating and left. \n\nThe key here is whether the customer overreacted. The customer didn't confront the manager, which might be expected in some cases. However, leaving without resolving the issue could be seen as not giving the employee a chance to fix it properly. But considering the employee admitted the price was wrong and was adjusting the weight, the customer might feel that the situation was getting resolved, so walking out could be seen as unnecessary. \n\nBut the customer's frustration is understandable given the confusion and the employee's initial mistakes. The customer might have felt that the employee wasn't handling it correctly and didn't want to escalate. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the employee was at fault for the mistakes, but the customer's response was to leave without further action. However, the customer didn't act aggressively, just left. So, the question is whether leaving was unreasonable. Some might say the customer should have asked to speak to a manager to ensure the issue was resolved, while others might empathize with the customer's frustration and say it's okay to walk away if the situation is too stressful. \n\nOverall, the customer isn't in the wrong because the employee made errors, and the frustration is justified. The customer's approach was non-confrontational but decisive. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
