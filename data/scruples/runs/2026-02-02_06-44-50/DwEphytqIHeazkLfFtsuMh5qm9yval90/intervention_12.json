She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nThe author went to a deli and asked for 1 lb of oven-roasted turkey at $3.98 per pound. The employee gave them 1.745 lbs, but charged $6.98 per pound, totaling $12.18. The author pointed out the discrepancy, and the employee claimed the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then, the employee asked if it was okay if it was a little over, so the author agreed. \n\nWait, the employee initially asked if it was okay if it was a little over, and the author said yes. But then the employee overcharged them by applying the higher price and giving more weight than requested. The author tried to correct the price, but the employee then questioned the weight. The employee then took the meat, cut down the amount to get the weight to 1.745 lbs, which is still more than the 1 lb the author asked for. The author became frustrated and left without paying, leaving the employee with the meat.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the author was overcharged, the employee made a mistake in pricing and weight, and the author reacted by leaving the items. Legally, taking goods without paying is theft, regardless of the situation. The author didn't try to resolve it by speaking to a manager or paying the correct amount. Even if the employee was wrong, the author's action of walking out without paying is not appropriate. The author should have either paid the correct amount if they agreed to the new price or sought to correct the error through proper channels. Leaving the goods and not paying is the wrong move. So, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
