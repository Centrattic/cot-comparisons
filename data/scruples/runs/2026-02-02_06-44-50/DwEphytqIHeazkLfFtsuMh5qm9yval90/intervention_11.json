She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a deli transaction where the customer thought they were charged more than the listed price. The customer got angry and left without saying anything.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The customer ordered 1 lb of turkey at $3.98 per pound. The deli employee gave them 1.745 lbs but charged $6.98 per pound, which is three times more. The employee said the price had gone up but the sign wasn't updated. The customer pointed out the weight was over a pound, and the employee tried to fix it by taking out slices and reweighing. The customer got frustrated, left the meat with the employee, and walked out.\n\nNow, who's at fault here? The employee made a pricing error. The listed price was $3.98, but she charged $6.98. The customer noticed this and tried to correct it. The employee tried to adjust but maybe not correctly. The customer, frustrated by the situation and the employee's handling of it, left in anger.\n\nThe author's action was to walk out without paying. That's the key point. Did the customer have the right to do that? Well, the customer was being charged incorrectly. The employee tried to adjust but didn't resolve the issue. The customer didn't confront the manager, didn't escalate, just walked away. But the customer did point out the mistake and then the employee tried to fix it, but maybe not to the customer's satisfaction. The customer might have felt cheated and couldn't handle the situation anymore.\n\nBut legally, the customer is responsible for paying for what they took. Even if there was a mistake, the customer can't just leave the goods. However, the employee also made a mistake. The question is whether the customer is in the wrong for walking out. The customer might have been justified in trying to get the correct price but leaving the meat was probably wrong because they didn't pay at all.\n\nSo the answer is A (the author is in the wrong). The customer should have either paid the correct amount if the new price was correct, or argued for the original price and then paid, or spoken to a manager. Leaving without paying is theft, regardless of the situation.\n"
