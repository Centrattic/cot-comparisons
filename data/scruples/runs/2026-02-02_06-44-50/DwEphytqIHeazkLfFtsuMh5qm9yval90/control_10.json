She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The story is from AITA (Am I the Asshole), which is a subreddit where people post scenarios and others vote on whether they're the asshole.\n\nThe situation is about a deli counter interaction. The author went to buy a pound of turkey that's supposed to be $3.98 per pound. The employee charges them $6.98 per pound for 1.745 pounds. The author points out the discrepancy, and the employee says they had a price increase but didn't update the sign. The employee then tries to adjust the amount by taking out meat, but the author gets frustrated and leaves without saying anything.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out who's at fault here. The employee might have made a pricing error, but the author is upset about being overcharged. The employee's response seems dismissive and possibly incorrect. The author's reaction is to leave abruptly, which could be seen as rude, but maybe justified due to frustration. \n\nThe key points are: Did the author have the right to leave without trying to resolve the issue? Is the employee at fault for the pricing error and poor customer service? The author's main issue is the overcharge and the employee's handling of the situation. The employee didn't correct the price tag, which caused confusion. The author tried to point it out but was ignored, leading to frustration. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, if the employee was incorrect about the price and the author tried to correct them but the employee dismissed their concerns, the employee might be at fault. However, the author walked out without trying to escalate to a manager, which could be seen as not following through. But the author might have felt that the employee wasn't taking the issue seriously. \n\nIn such cases, the store is usually responsible for pricing errors. If the employee made a mistake, the store should correct it. The author's frustration is understandable because they were overcharged. The employee's behavior of taking out meat in a haphazard way (tearing slices) might have been unprofessional, adding to the author's irritation. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving. In AITA scenarios, being abrupt or not attempting to resolve the issue can make someone the asshole, but if the other party was at fault, it might mitigate that. Since the employee was incorrect and unhelpful, the author's exit might be justified. \n\nSo, probably the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the employee made the mistake and didn't handle it well, leading to the author's understandable frustration. The author's decision to leave, while abrupt, might be within their rights given the situation.\n"
