She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a deli employee who overcharged the customer by using the wrong price. The customer noticed the mistake, pointed it out, and then the employee tried to fix it by removing meat. But the customer walked out without saying anything else. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave 1.745lbs but charged $6.98/lb, which is a significant overcharge. The customer pointed out the mistake, the employee acknowledged the price increase but didn't update the sign. The customer was told it was \"a little over,\" but it ended up being almost double the weight. The employee then tried to fix it by taking out slices, but the customer walked out.\n\nNow, the key points here. The customer was right to notice the overcharge. The employee made an error, and the customer brought it up politely. The employee's response was to try to fix it by reducing the amount of meat, but maybe not accurately. The customer, frustrated, left without resolving the issue. \n\nSo, was the customer wrong? Well, they did point out the mistake, which is the right thing to do. The employee might have been in the wrong for overcharging. But when the employee tried to correct it, the customer walked out. The customer could have asked to speak to a manager, but they didn't want to be the \"problem\" customer. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the customer was in the right to point out the error. However, walking out without trying to resolve it might be seen as inconsiderate. But the employee's behavior (like tearing up a slice) might have been unprofessional, leading to the customer's frustration. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The customer could have handled it better by staying and calmly resolving it, but the employee's actions also contributed to the customer's irritation. The customer didn't confront the employee aggressively, just walked out. So while the customer could have been more patient, the employee made the mistake. \n\nI think the main issue is whether the customer's reaction was excessive. Given the situation, the customer had a right to be upset. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's any misstep in the customer's actions. Since the customer was polite, pointed out the error, and the employee was unhelpful, the customer's walking out might be justified. So the answer is B.\n"
