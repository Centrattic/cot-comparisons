She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused and without speaking to her after a pricing dispute.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author asked for 1lb of oven roasted turkey at $3.98/lb, thinly sliced. The deli employee gave 1.745lbs at $6.98/lb, which the author noticed was overpriced. The employee admitted the sign hadn't been updated, then tried to fix it by taking out the meat, putting 2 slices and half another on the scale, resulting in a lower weight. The author, frustrated, left the basket and walked out.\n\nSo, the main points here are:\n\n1. The deli girl made a mistake in pricing, giving more weight but charging a higher rate by accident. The author points out the discrepancy.\n2. The employee tries to correct it but does so in a way that might be confusing or incorrect (taking out slices to reduce weight but not necessarily the exact amount).\n3. The author becomes irritated and leaves without further communication, not speaking to a manager.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but others might have different views. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn the author's side: They were correct to notice the pricing error. The deli girl was at fault for not updating the sign. The author tried to address it politely but became frustrated when the employee seemed to be trying to fix it in a way that left the author feeling it was still wrong. The author's action of leaving without speaking to a manager might be seen as not addressing the issue properly, but they also mention they didn't want to be confrontational.\n\nOn the deli girl's side: She was confused and perhaps made mistakes in her correction. She might have been new or overwhelmed, leading to the error. The author's decision to leave without resolving it could be seen as not giving her another chance to correct it, maybe even leaving her in a worse situation.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is the asshole. The employee was in the wrong first by mispricing, but the author's reaction is to walk out without trying to resolve the issue, even though they were right to point out the mistake. If the author had said they were still overcharged or asked for a manager, maybe that's better. However, the employee tried to correct it, but maybe the correction was insufficient. The author's frustration is understandable, but leaving the basket and exiting without communication could be seen as abrupt. \n\nIn some perspectives, the author is within their right to correct the pricing but should have followed through to ensure the issue was resolved properly. By not doing so, they might have caused the deli girl to be in a bind. But others might argue that the employee wasn't handling the situation well, so the author's decision to leave was justified. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were a reasonable response given the employee's mistake and incoherent correction. If the author felt that the employee was not adequately addressing the problem, perhaps walking out wasn't the best approach, but it's also a matter of personal tolerance and stress levels. \n\nI think the author is not entirely in the wrong because the employee made the initial error. However, the author's reaction could be seen as not being patient enough. The answer hinges on whether the author's response was proportionate. Since they did point out the mistake and the employee tried to correct it, maybe the author should have at least given her a chance to properly fix it rather than abandoning the situation. But the employee's confusion might have justified the author's exit. \n\nHmm. So in terms of the options, A is yes (author is in the wrong), B is no. Considering the situation, the employee had the initial mistake, and the author was correct to notice it. The employee's correction attempt was flawed, and the author's frustration led to walking out. The question is whether the author's reaction is the asshole part. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the employee was the one who erred, and the author was right to point it out. The confusion and incoherent correction from the employee might have pushed the author over the edge, and while leaving could be seen as harsh, the author's primary duty was to address the overcharge. If the employee wasn't handling it, maybe the author should have left and dealt with it another time. However, some might argue that proper resolution would require speaking to a manager. But the author did address the issue, and the employee was at fault. So, probably B.\n"
