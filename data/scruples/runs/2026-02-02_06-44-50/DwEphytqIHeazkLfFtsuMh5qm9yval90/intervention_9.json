She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is at a deli counter. The person ordered 1lb of turkey meat, which is supposed to be $3.98 per pound. The deli employee gave them 1.745 lbs but charged them at $6.98 per pound instead. The person points out the mistake, the employee says the price went up but the sign wasn't changed. Then there's a back and forth about the weight.\n\nFirst, the author asked for a pound, but got more than that. The employee agreed to give a little over, but then charged the higher price. The author noticed the price discrepancy and pointed it out. The employee tried to correct it by taking out the meat and rebagging it, but the author got angry and left without saying a word.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author is clearly frustrated because they were overcharged, and the employee seemed to make a mistake in pricing. The author tried to address it, but the employee was dismissive or unclear. The author's reaction was to leave abruptly without speaking to a manager or trying to resolve the issue further.\n\nOn one hand, the employee's mistake might be in charging the higher price without updating the sign, which could be a store policy issue. The author's right to question the price is valid. However, the author's response was to walk out without resolving the issue, which might be seen as not being a responsible customer. The employee was trying to fix the problem by rebagging the meat and adjusting the weight, but the author refused to engage further.\n\nBut the employee's actions also seem problematic. She took out the meat and started rebagging it, but the way she did it (using 2 slices, tearing another in half) makes the author look through her eyes and walk out, which is understandable frustration. The employee's handling of the situation might have escalated the problem.\n\nIn terms of responsibility: the store made a pricing error, and the employee might not have known how to correct it. The author had the right to question the price but left without addressing it properly. However, in some cases, if the employee is not able to resolve the issue, the author might be within their right to leave, though not ideal.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not following up or trying to resolve the issue, but the employee's handling of the situation also contributed. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they left without resolving it, maybe A is the answer. But some might argue that the author's frustration is justified given the employee's confusion and incorrect handling.\n"
