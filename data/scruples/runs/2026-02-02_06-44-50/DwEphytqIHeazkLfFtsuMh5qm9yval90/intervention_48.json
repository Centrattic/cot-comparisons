She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is at a deli. The author asked for 1 lb of turkey meat at $3.98 per pound. The employee gave them 1.745 lbs but charged them at $6.98 per pound. The author pointed out the mistake, the employee initially denied it, then tried to correct it by taking out meat, but the interaction got heated and the author left without saying anything.\n\nFirst, the employee made a pricing error. The sign said $3.98, but the actual price was $6.98. The author noticed and tried to correct it. The employee then had to adjust the weight to match the original request. But when the employee tried to give the correct amount (which was much less), the author was frustrated and walked out.\n\nThe key points here are about the employee's mistake and the author's reaction. The employee was in the wrong for mischarging, but the author's response might have been too harsh. The author left the employee confused and without a resolution. However, considering the stress of the situation, maybe the author was justified in their frustration. The employee's behavior (denying the mistake first, then trying to fix it) could have been confusing and time-consuming. The author just wanted to get their correct purchase without hassle. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They didn't confront the employee further, didn't escalate, but just left. The employee might have been overwhelmed, but the author's main goal was to get the right item. It's a bit of a gray area. The employee made the mistake, but the author's reaction could be seen as impolite. However, the author might not be at fault for walking out after being treated poorly. The answer depends on whether the author's actions were reasonable given the employee's errors and the stressful interaction.\n"
