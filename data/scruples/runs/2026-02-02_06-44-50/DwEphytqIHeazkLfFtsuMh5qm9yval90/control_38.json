She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person in the story is in the wrong. So, they went to the deli, asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98 per pound. The employee sliced it, asked if it was okay if it was a little over, and then the customer was given a bag that was 1.745 lbs at $6.98 per pound, totaling around $12.18.\n\nFirst, the employee made a pricing error. The sign was outdated, so they charged the higher price. The customer pointed out the discrepancy in weight and price. The employee then tried to rebag by taking out slices, but maybe that wasn't done correctly. The customer got frustrated and left without saying anything else.\n\nThe question is whether the customer was wrong to leave abruptly. The employee was confused and perhaps not handling the situation well. The customer was polite initially but got irritated. The customer might have felt that the employee wasn't resolving the issue and was being inattentive. Leaving without further confrontation could be seen as a way to avoid arguing, but did they have a right to walk out without resolving the issue?\n\nOn one hand, the customer didn't pay the incorrect amount and left the situation. On the other hand, they didn't follow up to correct the mistake or talk to a manager. However, the employee was at fault for the pricing error and handling the situation poorly. The customer's frustration is understandable, but maybe they should have tried to resolve it further rather than leaving the employee confused.\n\nSo, considering the employee's mistake and the customer's valid concern about overpayment, the customer isn't entirely at fault. The answer is probably B (Not in the wrong).\n"
