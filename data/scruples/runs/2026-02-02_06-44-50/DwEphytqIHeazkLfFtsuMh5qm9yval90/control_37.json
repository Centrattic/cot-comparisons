She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter where the customer got overcharged and then left without saying anything.\n\nFirst, the customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98 per pound. The employee gave them 1.745 lbs but charged at $6.98 per pound. The customer pointed out the mistake, and the employee said the price had increased but didn't change the sign. Then the employee took the meat back, tried to repackage it with fewer slices, but the customer got frustrated and left.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the employee made an error in pricing and quantity, the customer noticed and brought it up, the employee was uncooperative and tried to correct it in a way that still left the customer overcharged. The customer then left without finishing the interaction.\n\nI need to determine if the customer was wrong to leave. The customer was polite initially but became irritated. When the employee tried to fix it by taking out slices, maybe the customer felt they were being shortchanged again? Or maybe the process was too slow and the customer didn't have time or patience.\n\nIs the customer's action of leaving justified? Well, if the employee was being unhelpful or not resolving the issue properly, the customer might have felt they couldn't deal with it anymore. However, the proper thing to do might have been to ask for a manager or clarify the situation further. But the customer didn't want to be a hassle and just left, which could be seen as not standing up for themselves or their rights. Alternatively, they might have had enough and didn't want to escalate it.\n\nIn terms of who's at fault: the store made the pricing error, the employee was unresponsive. The customer tried to address it but got frustrated. The customer leaving without a resolution might not make them the asshole, but maybe they could have handled it better. However, the employee's actions (like tearing the meat) might have been unprofessional, leading to the customer's loss of patience.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the customer isn't in the wrong) because the store made the mistake and the employee was unhelpful. The customer's frustration is understandable, and walking out after being corrected is a reaction to the employee's behavior. The customer isn't the one who made the pricing error, so they aren't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
