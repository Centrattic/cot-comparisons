She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for leaving the deli counter without buying any meat after a pricing issue.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author asked for 1lb of oven roasted turkey at $3.98/lb. The deli employee gave them 1.745lbs priced at $6.98/lb. The author pointed out the discrepancy, the employee claimed the price sign was outdated. Then the author got more meat, the employee tried to adjust by taking out some meat, but the author left without completing the purchase.\n\nNow, considering the facts. The employee initially overcharged the author. The author politely pointed out the mistake. The employee then tried to correct it by removing some meat, but the author was annoyed and left. The question is if the author is in the wrong for their reaction.\n\nFrom a customer perspective, being overcharged is a problem. The author checked the weight and price, which is reasonable. The employee's job is to provide the correct amount and price. The author's irritation is understandable, but walking out might have been a hasty response. However, the employee's actions in adjusting the meat by tearing it in half could be seen as an attempt to fix the issue, but maybe the author felt it was too slow or unprofessional.\n\nThe key points are: Did the author have a right to get upset? The employee made an error, and the author is within their rights to dispute incorrect charges. But leaving without paying\u2014wait, no, the author didn't pay for the meat they were holding. The employee was in the process of correcting the amount and price, so the author didn't take the item without paying. They left the meat at the counter and walked out. So the author didn't steal; they just walked away from the transaction.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, the author's reaction (dead eyes, walking out) might be seen as rude, but the employee was also making mistakes. The author's actions might be justified given the confusion and the desire to avoid a conflict. The employee's behavior in adjusting the meat by tearing it might have been unhygienic or not up to standard, which could add to the author's frustration.\n\nSo, the author is not necessarily in the wrong. They had a valid reason to be upset about being overcharged and the employee's errors. The walkout was perhaps abrupt, but it's a personal reaction to a situation they found unacceptable. The employee likely bears responsibility for the pricing error and the way she handled the correction.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
