She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a deli counter where the customer is upset over a pricing and weight mistake. The customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb, but got charged $12.18 for 1.745 lbs at $6.98. The employee made a mistake, and when the customer pointed it out, the employee was dismissive and tried to fix it by taking out some meat. The customer then left without saying a word, leaving the employee confused.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The customer was clearly frustrated. The employee made an error in pricing and weight. The customer tried to point it out politely, but the employee was unhelpful. The customer then left without completing the transaction. The user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nSo, is the customer (author) in the wrong? Let's break it down. The employee made mistakes, which is on the store. The customer was within their right to point out the error. However, the customer's reaction was to just walk out, leaving the employee with the meat and the situation unresolved. \n\nThe author claims they didn't want to escalate by talking to a manager. But maybe they could have handled it more politely. The employee was trying to fix it, but the customer left abruptly. The customer might have at least said something like, \"I can't deal with this right now; I'll come back\" or left a note. Instead, they walked out without explanation, which could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nHowever, the employee was also not helpful and possibly defensive. The customer was under stress and couldn't handle the situation. Maybe the author isn't the asshole for losing patience. But leaving the employee confused without any communication could be rude. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the person who leaves a situation without proper closure might be seen as in the wrong. The customer had a legitimate issue, but the way they handled it could be problematic. Alternatively, the employee's behavior also contributed to the customer's frustration. \n\nSo, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because the employee made the mistake and was unhelpful, leading the customer to lose patience. The customer had a right to be upset, and leaving might have been an overreaction, but the employee's actions also contributed. However, the customer could have communicated better. But in the end, the author's actions might be seen as justified given the employee's behavior. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the customer should have handled it differently, even if the employee was wrong. So maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate properly and left the employee in a difficult situation. But I'm a bit split. Need to decide.\n"
