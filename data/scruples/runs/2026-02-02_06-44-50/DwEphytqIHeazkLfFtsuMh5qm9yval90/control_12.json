She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter interaction where there was a pricing discrepancy. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author went to the deli, asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee sliced it, asked if a little over was okay, and then priced it at $6.98/lb for 1.745lbs totaling $12.18. The author pointed out the mistake, the employee said the price had increased but hadn't updated the sign. The author was confused because they were charged more than double the listed price. The employee then tried to adjust the weight by taking out the meat and rebagging it with fewer slices, but the author left without finishing the interaction.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. The key points here are the employee's actions and the author's response. The employee made a pricing error, perhaps due to a sign not being updated. The author tried to correct it politely, but the employee didn't acknowledge the initial price but instead adjusted the weight to match the higher price. This seems like the employee was trying to charge the higher price without confirming with the customer, which is misleading.\n\nThe author, after multiple back-and-forths, became frustrated and left. The employee's behavior\u2014arguing about the weight and not addressing the price discrepancy\u2014probably contributed to the author's frustration. The author didn't escalate the issue to a manager, which might be a standard step, but walking out might be seen as abrupt. However, given the employee's confusing and possibly incorrect actions, the author's decision to leave could be justified as they didn't want to deal with the hassle. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the employee likely made a mistake in pricing and didn't handle it smoothly. The author tried to resolve it but lost patience. Depending on perspective, the author might be seen as inconsiderate for leaving without trying to resolve it further, but the employee's actions could have been the root cause. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because the employee's behavior was confusing and possibly at fault. However, there's a nuance. The employee might have been following store policy, but the story suggests the employee was incorrect. The author's irritation is understandable given the situation. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
