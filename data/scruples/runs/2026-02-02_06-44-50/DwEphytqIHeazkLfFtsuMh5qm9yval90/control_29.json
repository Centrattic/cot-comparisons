She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The situation is about a customer at a deli counter who feels they were overcharged. The customer asked for a pound of turkey meat at $3.98 per pound. The employee ended up charging $6.98 per pound and gave almost two pounds worth of meat, which the customer says was sliced way too thick.\n\nFirst, the customer points out the mistake in price and weight. The employee claims the price has increased but hasn't updated the sign, which seems like a possible error. Then the employee questions where it says it's 1.745 pounds, showing maybe she didn't check the scale properly. The customer is clearly frustrated when the employee starts rebagging the meat by cutting slices, which might be a slow or incorrect process. The customer then leaves without saying more.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? The customer tried to point out the mistake politely. The employee's response seems dismissive, not acknowledging the customer's concerns. The customer's frustration builds up, leading to them walking out. The key here is whether the customer acted unreasonably. They didn't yell or cause a scene; they just left. In such situations, customers have the right to expect accurate pricing and weight. If the employee was uncooperative, the customer isn't obligated to stay and argue. So the answer is probably B, the customer isn't in the wrong.\n"
