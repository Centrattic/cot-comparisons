She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is at a deli where there was a pricing discrepancy. The author went to buy a pound of turkey meat, but the deli employee gave them 1.745 lbs at a higher price per pound than what was advertised.\n\nFirst, the employee made a mistake with the price tag. The customer pointed out the mistake, and the employee admitted the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then, the customer noticed the weight was over a pound, and the employee tried to fix it by cutting slices and rebagging. The customer got frustrated and left without saying anything.\n\nSo, the author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for leaving abruptly. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to determine if the customer acted wrongly.\n\nThe key points here are the employee's mistake in pricing and weight, the customer's reaction. The employee initially admitted the price was higher but didn't update the sign. Then, when the customer pointed out the weight issue, the employee tried to adjust it but perhaps not correctly. The customer lost patience and left. \n\nThe customer's frustration is understandable because they were being overcharged due to the employee's mistake. However, the customer didn't complete the transaction and left without resolving the issue. The employee might have been trying to correct the mistake, but the customer walked out. \n\nIn such situations, it's generally expected to either resolve the issue by speaking to a manager or returning later. However, the customer's frustration is valid because they were being overcharged. The employee's actions might have been incorrect in adjusting the weight (using 2 slices and tearing another), which could have led to an incorrect final weight. \n\nThe customer's decision to leave might be seen as a way to avoid an uncomfortable situation, but not necessarily wrong. The employee was at fault for the initial mistake. The customer's right to be upset and leave without further confrontation might be justified. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (no), the author is not in the wrong. They were dealing with a mistake that cost them money, and their frustration led them to leave, which is a reasonable reaction given the circumstances.\n"
