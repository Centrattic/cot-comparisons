She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a customer at a deli who gets charged way more than expected for sliced turkey meat. The author goes to the deli, asks for 1lb of turkey at $3.98 per pound, thinly sliced. The employee slices it, asks if it's okay if it's a little over, and then the author gets a package that's 1.745 lbs but priced at $6.98 per pound. The total comes out to $12.18 instead of around $4. So the author points out the mistake, the employee says the price increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then the author gets more upset when the weight is over a pound, and the employee starts reweighing it, which is done in a way that the author finds ridiculous. Finally, the author just leaves without saying anything. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The employee made a mistake in pricing, which is on the store's side. The author is a customer who's facing an unexpected charge, so they have a right to question the discrepancy. However, the employee's response that the price increased but the sign wasn't updated could be a common issue in retail, where signs aren't immediately updated after a price change. The author is right to check the weight since they asked for exactly 1lb, and the weight being over that is another point of contention. The employee then tries to reweigh the meat, which the author finds unsatisfactory.\n\nNow, the author's actions: they leave the deli without completing the transaction, leaving the employee with the meat. The key here is whether the author handled the situation appropriately. Typically, when a customer encounters a pricing error, the correct course of action is to bring it to the attention of a manager or at least try to resolve it with the employee. The author, however, decided to walk out instead of following up, possibly to avoid confrontation. The question is whether this is acceptable.\n\nOn one hand, the author was in a situation where they felt disrespected or wronged, and their frustration is understandable. Retail interactions can be stressful, especially when there's a clear error. Walking out might be a way to remove themselves from an uncomfortable situation. On the other hand, leaving without resolving the issue might leave the employee in a difficult spot, especially if the employee is already stressed or if the author is leaving them with the meat. The employee might be left to deal with the meat, which could go to waste or require a manager to step in.\n\nBut the employee was the one who made the mistake, so the responsibility here is on the store. The author's right to question the price is valid. However, by leaving, the author might be contributing to the employee's stress, even if the employee is at fault. The author could have either calmly asked for a manager or walked out after stating their issue, but leaving the meat behind might be seen as inconsiderate, even if the employee is at fault.\n\nIn terms of social norms, when you walk away from a situation without resolving it, even if you have a valid reason, you might be seen as avoiding responsibility or conflict. However, the alternative is to escalate the situation, which the author didn't want to do. So, it's a balance between standing up for oneself and being respectful in the process. The author's frustration is justified, but the method of walking out without further communication might be seen as abrupt. However, considering the employee's behavior (taking out the meat, reweighing in a way the author found unacceptable), the author might have felt it's not worth engaging further.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author had a duty to at least inform the employee or a manager of the issue. Since the author didn't say a word and just left, that's where the potential issue lies. They could have left a note or at least communicated their concern to someone else. But the employee might be left in the dark about what happened. However, the store is responsible for the pricing error, so the author might not have an obligation to resolve it on their own. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on whether leaving the situation without explanation is considered rude or inconsiderate, even if the initial issue is the store's fault.\n"
