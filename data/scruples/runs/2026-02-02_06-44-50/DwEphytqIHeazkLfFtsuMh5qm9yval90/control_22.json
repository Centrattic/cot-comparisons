She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter interaction where a customer ends up leaving without resolving a pricing mistake.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The customer asked for 1lb of turkey meat at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745lbs but charged $6.98/lb, which is over double the price. The customer pointed out the mistake, the employee tried to explain the price increase, then the customer noticed the weight was more than a pound. The employee then tried to repackage it, but the customer left in frustration.\n\nNow, considering the actions of both parties. The employee made a pricing error and didn't initially correct it. The customer tried to point out the mistake politely. The employee then became defensive, asked for the weight to be checked, and then attempted to repackage it. The customer lost patience and left.\n\nThe question is about whether the author (customer) is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe customer didn't act aggressively, just left after trying to resolve it. The employee's behavior seems unprofessional\u2014charging the wrong price, not addressing the weight issue effectively. The customer's frustration is understandable given the situation. The employee's actions might have been the main issue here. The customer's departure without resolving it might be seen as impolite, but in the context of being mistreated, it's debatable.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (no), because the customer was trying to correct a mistake and left due to the employee's unhelpful behavior. The customer isn't in the wrong here.\n"
