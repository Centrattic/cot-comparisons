She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter interaction where there was a pricing and weight discrepancy. The author left without saying anything after getting upset.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745lbs but charged $6.98/lb, which is more expensive. The customer pointed out the mistake, the employee said the price had increased but hadn't updated the sign. Then when the customer mentioned the weight being over a pound, the employee seemed confused and started rebagging by taking out slices and weighing parts. The customer got frustrated and left without finishing the interaction.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? The customer noticed the price discrepancy and tried to correct it. The employee might have made a mistake in pricing or weight. The customer's reaction was to leave without resolving it, which could be seen as rude. But was the customer in the wrong?\n\nThe key points are: the customer pointed out the error, the employee was unhelpful or confused, leading to the customer's frustration. The customer didn't escalate to a manager but left instead. \n\nPossible angles: The customer had a right to question the pricing. The employee's confusion or incorrect handling of the situation could be the store's responsibility. However, leaving without addressing it could be seen as not standing up for oneself, but maybe the customer was just done with the poor service. \n\nIs the author wrong for leaving? If the main issue is the customer not following up, maybe they could have handled it better. But the employee's behavior (like tearing a slice and putting it on the scale) might have been unprofessional, leading to the customer's loss of patience. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the expectation is to resolve the issue politely. The customer did try to point out the mistake but got fed up. Leaving without a word might be impolite, but the employee's actions might have contributed. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because the employee's response was confusing and possibly incorrect. However, not resolving the issue by speaking to a manager could be seen as a misstep. But the immediate reaction to leave might be understandable given the frustration. The answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the employee was at fault for the pricing mistake and unhelpful behavior, and the customer's reaction, while abrupt, was a result of poor service.\n"
