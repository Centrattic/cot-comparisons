She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The situation is about the person at the deli counter and the customer who left in frustration.\n\nFirst, the customer ordered 1 lb of turkey meat at $3.98 per pound. The deli employee gave them 1.745 lbs priced at $6.98 per pound. The customer noticed the discrepancy in weight and price. The employee initially said the price had gone up but didn't change the sign, which is a bit odd. Then when the customer pointed out the weight was over a pound more, the employee had to check, which made the customer more irritated. Then the employee tried to fix it by taking the meat back, cutting slices, and re-bagging it. The customer left without saying anything.\n\nSo, the key points here: the employee made a mistake in pricing and weight. The customer was polite but got more frustrated as the interaction went on. The employee's actions of taking the meat back and adjusting it might have been confusing or made the customer feel disrespected, especially since the customer was already annoyed. The customer left without resolving the issue, which might be seen as rude because they didn't address the problem, possibly leaving the employee in the lurch.\n\nBut wait, the customer's main issue was the incorrect pricing and weight. The employee was trying to fix it, but maybe in a confusing way. The customer might have felt that the employee was not being transparent or was trying to charge more. However, the customer could have just walked out if they were frustrated, but not saying anything could be seen as abandoning the employee. On the other hand, the customer was in their right to leave if the interaction was too stressful and didn't want to deal with the manager. \n\nIs the customer in the wrong? Well, they didn't pay the correct amount. If they left without resolving the issue, the store might end up losing money. But the customer might not have known the correct price until after the fact. The employee's mistake was to apply the higher price without updating the sign, which is the employee's error. The customer was a victim of the mistake. However, the way the employee handled the correction (tearing meat, etc.) might have been unprofessional, adding to the customer's irritation. \n\nThe customer left without explanation, which might be considered rude. But the question is if the customer is in the wrong. The employee made a mistake, but the customer didn't confront the manager or address the issue. They just left the employee with the meat. That could be seen as not taking responsibility. Alternatively, the customer was justified in being frustrated and walked out to avoid conflict. \n\nI think the customer made a mistake by not resolving the issue, but maybe not in the wrong entirely. However, the main question is whether they are the asshole. Since they left the employee with the meat and didn't say anything, it's possible they are in the wrong because they didn't handle it properly. Alternatively, the employee's behavior was unprofessional, so the customer might have been right to leave. \n\nHmm. I'm a bit torn. The customer's actions were abrupt, but the employee was at fault. However, not saying anything and leaving the employee in the middle of the situation could be considered inconsiderate. So maybe the answer is A (the customer is in the wrong) because they didn't address the issue properly and left the employee with the problem. But if the customer felt that the employee was being uncooperative, maybe they were justified. I'm still leaning towards A because the customer didn't take the proper steps to resolve the issue and left the employee in a tough spot.\n"
