She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli counter in frustration. Let me start by understanding the scenario.\n\nThe author went to the deli, asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98 per pound. The employee sliced the meat, asked if it was okay if it was a bit over, which the author agreed to. Then, the author noticed the price was $12.18 for 1.745 lbs at $6.98 per pound. They pointed out the mistake, and the employee said the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then the author pointed out the weight was over a pound, and the employee took the meat back. She started measuring slices, putting 2 slices on the scale, tearing another in half, and rebagging. The author then left without saying anything.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the price discrepancy, the weight being more than requested, and the employee's handling of the situation. The author tried to correct the mistake politely, but the employee's response was confusing. The employee didn't immediately acknowledge the mistake and instead tried to measure the meat in a way that might not resolve the issue. The author, frustrated, left without further confrontation.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The employee made an error in pricing and weight. The author pointed out the mistake and tried to resolve it. The employee's response was unhelpful, leading to the author's frustration. The author didn't yell or cause a scene but left when they couldn't tolerate the situation anymore. The question is about whether the author's actions were wrong.\n\nPossible angles: \n1. The author had a right to correct the error and was being reasonable.\n2. The employee's job is to ensure correct pricing and weight, so the error was on their part.\n3. The author left without resolving the issue, but the employee's behavior might have contributed to the author's decision to leave.\n4. The author didn't escalate to a manager, but maybe that's their prerogative.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the employee made the mistake. The author tried to address it. The employee's response was confusing and possibly incorrect in how they handled the rebagging. The author might have felt that further confrontation would be unproductive. Walking out might be seen as a personal choice, not necessarily wrong, especially if the employee wasn't helpful. However, leaving without resolving could be seen as impolite, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not if they should have done something else. \n\nConsidering these points, the author isn't necessarily at fault. The error was the store's, and the author's frustration is understandable. The answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
