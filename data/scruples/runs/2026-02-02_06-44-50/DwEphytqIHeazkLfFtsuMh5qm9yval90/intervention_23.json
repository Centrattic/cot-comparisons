She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a deli counter interaction. The person went to buy turkey meat, got overcharged, and then walked out without saying anything. They're asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The deli girl gave them 1.745lbs but charged $6.98/lb. The author pointed out the mistake, the employee said the price went up but the sign wasn't changed. Then the author pointed out the weight was over a pound, and the employee had to rebag it. The author got frustrated and left without finishing the interaction.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Was the author's reaction appropriate? Did they have a right to be upset? The employee made a pricing and weighing error. The author tried to correct it politely but then became irritated. The employee's response was dismissive initially, then she tried to fix it but in a way that the author found unsatisfactory (taking out the meat, cutting slices, etc.). The author left in frustration.\n\nNow, considering the options. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. The employee made a mistake, which is on the store, not the customer. The customer tried to point it out but the employee was unhelpful. The author's frustration is understandable. However, walking out without resolving the issue might be seen as not handling it properly. The author could have asked to speak to a manager, but they chose not to. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is that the store overcharged and gave more weight than requested. The customer's main fault is losing patience and not following up. But the store is at fault for the mistake. The author's actions, while abrupt, might be justifiable given the employee's unhelpful behavior. However, not resolving the issue could be seen as the customer's problem if they didn't take steps to fix it. \n\nIn terms of social norms, walking out might be seen as rude, but the situation was frustrating. The employee's actions (like cutting the meat in a way that seems haphazard) might have contributed to the customer's decision to leave. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the store made the mistake. However, leaving without addressing it could be seen as not taking responsibility to resolve the issue. But the employee's behavior might have justified the author's reaction. \n\nThe answer might be a bit of a toss-up. But given that the customer tried to correct the error and the employee was uncooperative, the customer's frustration is valid. However, leaving without resolution might be seen as the customer's fault in terms of not following up. \n\nBut the options are A for yes (author wrong) and B for no. Considering the situation, the author's main wrongdoing is not the mistake but leaving without resolving it. However, the store was at fault for the error. The customer's frustration is understandable. \n\nI think the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because the store made the error and the employee's response was poor. The author's reaction, while abrupt, was a result of the employee's unhelpful behavior. The customer isn't obligated to handle the situation politely if the employee is being dismissive. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
