She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter interaction.\n\nFirst, the author went to buy deli meat. The employee made a pricing mistake, charging the higher price of $6.98 instead of the displayed $3.98. The author pointed out the mistake, and there was some back and forth. The employee initially denied the mistake, then tried to fix the weight by taking out meat. The author got frustrated and left without finishing the interaction.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? The employee made an error in pricing, which is on the store. The author called out the mistake, which is reasonable. The employee's response was poor\u2014denying the error and then trying to adjust the weight in a way that seemed haphazard. The author, after multiple attempts to resolve it, left. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for leaving without finishing the transaction? Probably not. The store made the mistake, and the employee was unhelpful. The author's frustration is understandable. They didn't yell or cause a scene; they just left. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
