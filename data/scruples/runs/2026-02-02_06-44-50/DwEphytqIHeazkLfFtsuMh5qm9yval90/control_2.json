She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter interaction. \n\nFirst, the customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The deli employee gave them 1.745lbs priced at $6.98/lb. The customer pointed out the discrepancy, and the employee said the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. The customer gets irritated when the employee questions the weight and then the employee starts re-slicing the meat. The customer leaves without saying anything.\n\nSo, the main points are: the employee made a pricing error, the customer was frustrated, and the employee was possibly dismissive or slow to resolve the issue. The customer left abruptly without resolving it, which might be seen as rude.\n\nIs the customer in the wrong? Well, the employee did make a mistake, but the customer's reaction was to just walk out. While the employee's behavior was unprofessional, the customer could have asked to speak to a manager instead of leaving. However, the customer was dealing with a mistake in their favor (more meat at a higher price), but they were still charged more than the original price. The customer was right to point out the weight discrepancy. The employee's handling of the situation was poor, but the customer leaving without resolving it could be seen as not giving the employee a chance to fix the problem. However, the customer's frustration is understandable given the employee's tone and actions. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the customer left without addressing the issue. While the employee was at fault for the pricing error, the customer could have handled it more politely. However, the customer's right to leave if they're dissatisfied is also valid. It's a bit of a gray area, but the customer's actions, while abrupt, might not be the sole wrong because the employee was also at fault. The customer didn't escalate it further, which could be seen as a positive. But not saying anything and leaving might be considered rude. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the situation was already messed up, and the customer had the right to leave, even if it was abrupt. The employee's behavior contributed to the conflict.\n"
