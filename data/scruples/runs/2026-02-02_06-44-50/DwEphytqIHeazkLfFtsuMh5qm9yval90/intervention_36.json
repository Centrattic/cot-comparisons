She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused after a pricing and weight discrepancy. \n\nFirst, the situation: The person asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee mistakenly charged $6.98/lb and gave 1.745 lbs. The customer pointed out the mistake, was told the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. The customer was told it's okay if it's a bit over, but the weight was significantly over. The employee then tried to fix it by removing some meat, but the customer got frustrated and left without saying a word.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: Did the customer handle the situation appropriately? The customer was polite initially, pointed out the mistake, but became irritated when the employee didn't immediately resolve it. The employee's actions might have been confusing or dismissive, leading to the customer's frustration. \n\nThe customer could have escalated the issue to a manager, but chose not to. They left without finishing the transaction. The question is whether the customer is in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the customer was correct in pointing out the error and the overcharge. The employee made a mistake, and the customer had the right to question it. However, the customer's response\u2014leaving without resolving the issue and leaving the employee confused\u2014might be seen as abrupt or inconsiderate. \n\nBut the employee's handling of the situation might have contributed. If the employee was defensive or didn't acknowledge the mistake, the customer's frustration is understandable. However, leaving the store without finishing the transaction could be seen as abandoning the employee in the middle of a problem. \n\nIn retail, employees are expected to handle mistakes, but customers also have a responsibility to communicate clearly. The customer's irritation is justified due to being overcharged, but the exit without a resolution might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the customer's actions were reasonable given the employee's response. If the employee was unhelpful or dismissive, the customer's frustration is valid, but leaving without a resolution could still be seen as inconsiderate. Alternatively, the customer could have escalated instead of walking out. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to decide based on the scenario. The customer did point out the mistake, was initially polite, and the employee's actions were confusing. The final act of walking out without a word might be seen as inconsiderate, but the customer was wronged. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because the employee made a mistake and didn't handle it well. The customer had the right to leave if they felt the situation wasn't being resolved properly. So the answer is B."
