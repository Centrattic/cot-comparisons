She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter interaction where the customer ends up leaving without resolving a pricing discrepancy.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745lbs but charged $6.98/lb, which is more expensive. The customer pointed out the mistake, and the employee initially said the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then, when the customer pointed out the weight was over a pound, the employee denied it and started rebagging, putting in only a few slices. The customer then left without paying or speaking further.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are: Did the customer have a right to be upset? Was the employee wrong in overcharging? The customer was correct in pointing out the price discrepancy and the incorrect weight. The employee's response seems to be trying to correct the issue by giving less product, which might be a mistake. The customer, frustrated, left without completing the transaction. \n\nIs the customer at fault for walking out? Well, the employee was trying to correct the issue, but maybe the customer could have just waited or asked for a manager. However, the employee's actions might not be entirely in the customer's favor. By rebagging and giving less product, maybe the employee was trying to charge the higher price without the correct amount. The customer might have felt that the employee was not resolving the issue correctly. \n\nThe customer's actions: they didn't pay for the meat they initially received, but after the employee rebagged it, they didn't take it either. So, did they take any product without paying? The original meat was over a pound and overcharged, but after the rebagging, it was a smaller amount. The customer left without paying for either, which could be considered theft. However, the employee might have still been processing the transaction. \n\nBut in the US, you're supposed to pay for items once they're given. If the customer took the product and left without paying after the employee tried to correct the mistake, that could be an issue. However, the customer might have been trying to avoid being overcharged, so they left to not engage further. \n\nThe question is about whether the customer is at fault for their reaction. The employee made a mistake in pricing and then tried to adjust by giving less product. The customer's frustration is understandable, but leaving without resolving the issue could be seen as not following up properly. However, the employee might not have given a correct solution. \n\nSo, is the customer in the wrong? They didn't confront the employee further, but they also didn't take the product they were offered after the correction. It's a bit of a grey area. If the customer left the deli without paying for any product, that's not right. But if they were still in the process of the transaction, maybe they were just exiting the store. \n\nAlternatively, the customer could have said they don't want the product anymore and walked out, which is their right. However, the employee might have already given them a corrected amount, so not taking it and leaving could be seen as abandoning the purchase, but not necessarily stealing. \n\nConsidering the facts, the employee was at fault for the initial mistake. The customer pointed it out, and the employee tried to correct it. The customer's frustration led them to leave, which might be seen as a loss of patience, but not necessarily wrong. However, the customer didn't actually take any product without paying; they left the basket and walked out. So maybe they didn't take anything, but the act of leaving without completing the transaction could be seen as not following proper protocol. \n\nIn conclusion, the employee made the mistake, the customer was within their rights to question it, but the customer could have handled it more calmly. However, the customer not completing the transaction by walking out might not be entirely their fault, especially if they were trying to avoid being overcharged. The answer might be B (No, not in the wrong) because the employee was at fault, and the customer's reaction, while abrupt, was in response to being overcharged.\n"
