She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused and without speaking to anyone else about the issue.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author went to the deli, asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98 per pound. The employee made a mistake, charging at $6.98 per pound for almost 1.75 lbs. The author points out the mistake politely, but the employee is defensive and tries to fix it by giving much less meat. The author then leaves without saying a word, causing the employee to be left with the problem.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author handle the situation appropriately? The employee made an error, and the author tried to correct it. The employee then tried to adjust the amount but gave an insufficient amount. The author, now frustrated, leaves without resolving the issue.\n\nNow, considering the options: A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nThe author's actions: They tried to point out the mistake, but when the employee didn't resolve it properly, they left. They didn't escalate to a manager or return later. The question is whether leaving was wrong. The author could have spoken to a manager, but they chose not to. However, they were visibly irritated and couldn't handle the interaction. Was that the right call?\n\nOn one hand, the author did try to address the issue and then left, not causing further disruption. On the other, leaving the employee in the lurch might be inconsiderate. But the employee was the one who made the error. The author's frustration is understandable given the situation. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the store is responsible for the pricing error. The author's right to get the correct price is valid. The employee's incorrect handling of the situation led to the conflict. The author's exit might have been abrupt, but they might have felt it was a lost cause. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a judgment call. The employee's behavior wasn't great, but the author's response might have been impulsive. However, since the store is responsible, maybe the author isn't the one at fault here. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author tried to address it but walked away when it wasn't resolved properly. They didn't escalate, but they were in a valid position. The employee's actions were the main issue. So, B.\n"
