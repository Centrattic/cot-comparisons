She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is at a deli counter where there's a pricing discrepancy and some confusion.\n\nFirst, the customer asked for 1 lb of turkey meat at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745 lbs but charged $6.98/lb, which is more expensive. The customer pointed out the mistake, the employee tried to justify it by saying the price had gone up but the sign wasn't changed. Then the employee took back the meat, tried to repackage it, but the customer left without finishing the interaction.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the customer have a right to question the overcharge? The employee made a mistake in pricing, so the customer was correct in pointing that out. The employee's response was dismissive and confusing, which added to the customer's frustration. \n\nThe customer did ask for a pound, got almost twice the weight but at a higher price. The employee's actions of taking the meat back and trying to repackage it in a way that might not be fair also contributed to the conflict. The customer's reaction was to leave without further discussion. \n\nNow, was the customer wrong? The customer wasn't aggressive; they were polite but eventually couldn't handle the employee's behavior. The employee's mistake led to the problem, and the customer was trying to resolve it. However, walking out without resolving it could be seen as not trying to fix the issue. But considering the employee's uncooperative attitude, maybe it's understandable. \n\nThe question is whether the customer is in the wrong. The employee was at fault for the pricing error and the way she handled it. The customer was correct in pointing it out. The customer's frustration is justified given the employee's response. The customer didn't yell or be rude, just left. So the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The employee made the mistake and handled it poorly, so the customer's actions are justified.\n"
