She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a customer at a deli who ends up with a much more expensive and heavier amount of meat than they asked for. The customer confronts the employee, and after some back and forth, the customer leaves without saying anything else.\n\nFirst, the customer asked for 1 pound of turkey at $3.98 per pound. The employee initially says it might be a little over, which the customer agrees to. But then the customer is charged $6.98 per pound for 1.745 pounds, which is way over the original price. The customer points this out, and the employee claims the price has gone up but the sign wasn't updated. Then the employee seems to misread the weight, not realizing it's over a pound. The author is frustrated, the employee tries to fix it by taking out slices and re-weighing, but the customer just leaves.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving without saying anything else. Let's break down the key points.\n\n1. **Customer's Intent**: The customer wanted to buy 1 pound at a specific price. The employee made a mistake in pricing and weight. The customer politely pointed out the error but was then treated dismissively by the employee. The employee didn't seem to take the customer's concerns seriously, even when the weight was clearly over 1 pound.\n\n2. **Employee's Actions**: The employee first agreed to the original price but then charged the higher rate, which the customer didn't agree to. Then, when the customer noticed the weight was wrong, the employee didn't acknowledge the error but instead tried to re-weigh the product in a way that might not have been accurate (using only a few slices). The employee's response was dismissive and confusing.\n\n3. **Customer's Reaction**: The customer tried to correct the mistake politely. When the employee didn't resolve the issue, the customer became irritated and left. The customer didn't escalate the situation by asking for a manager or causing a scene, which is often a consideration in these kinds of situations.\n\n4. **Ethical Considerations**: The customer is not in the wrong for not paying for a product they didn't agree to buy. The store made an error in pricing and weight. The customer's frustration is understandable given the employee's unhelpful and possibly incorrect actions. Walking out, while perhaps abrupt, is a personal choice to avoid conflict, especially if the customer felt the situation wasn't being resolved properly.\n\n5. **Possible Misunderstandings**: The employee might have been under stress or made a mistake. However, the key point is that the customer was not at fault for the error. The employee's behavior, including not listening and trying to repackage without a clear explanation, contributed to the customer's decision to leave.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the store is responsible for accurate pricing and weight. The customer is within their rights to point out the mistake and seek a correction. The customer's frustration led them to leave, which is their prerogative, especially if they felt the employee wasn't addressing the issue properly. The customer isn't in the wrong for not wanting to escalate the situation, as the store is responsible for the error. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
