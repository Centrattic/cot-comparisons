She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a deli girl who messed up the price and the weight of the meat. The author left without saying anything, which is the main point of contention.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author asked for 1lb of turkey meat at $3.98 per pound, but the deli girl gave them 1.745lbs and charged $6.98 per pound. The author noticed the mistake and tried to address it politely. The deli girl first said the price had gone up but the sign wasn't updated. Then, when the author pointed out the weight was over a pound, she took the meat back and tried to adjust it by cutting slices. The author got frustrated and left without resolving the issue.\n\nNow, the key points are: Did the author act unreasonably? The deli girl made an error, and the author tried to point it out. The deli girl then attempted to fix it by reducing the amount, but maybe the interaction escalated. The author's frustration led them to walk out, not wanting to deal with the situation further. \n\nI think the author's responsibility here is to bring the error to the store's attention, even if it's through a manager. By leaving, the author might be avoiding a confrontation, but the store is still overcharging. However, the author did try to address the issue with the employee, and the employee's response was dismissive. The author might have felt that escalating to a manager would be the next step, but they chose not to. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the deli girl made a mistake, and the author was trying to correct it. The author's irritation is understandable, but not resolving the issue by leaving might let the store keep the extra money. On the other hand, the employee was defensive and tried to fix it in a way (cutting meat) that might not be fair. The author could have left a note or addressed the issue another way, but walking out without any communication might be seen as abandoning the situation, which is why some might say the author is in the wrong. But others might understand the frustration with the employee's attitude and the hassle involved. \n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I think the answer is B. The author tried to address the issue but lost patience due to the employee's uncooperative behavior. Since the customer made a good-faith effort to correct the mistake and the employee was not helpful, the customer's decision to leave isn't necessarily the wrong thing to do. The store might still have the error, but the customer has rights to seek resolution, and if the employee isn't fixing it, maybe they should talk to a manager. However, in the moment, the customer's frustration is palpable, and walking out is a reaction to the employee's behavior, not the mistake itself. So, probably the answer is B.\n"
