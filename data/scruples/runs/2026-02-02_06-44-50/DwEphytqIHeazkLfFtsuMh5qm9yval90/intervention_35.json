She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl in a confused state after an argument over the price and weight of the meat.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person went to a deli, asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745 lbs priced at $6.98/lb. The person pointed out the discrepancy. The employee said the price had increased but didn't update the sign. Then, when the person mentioned the weight being over a pound, the employee questioned where that was stated. The employee then tried to rebag the meat by taking out slices and weighing them again. The person got so frustrated they just left without finishing the interaction.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the employee made a mistake in pricing and weight. The person tried to point that out, but the employee was dismissive and unhelpful. The person felt they couldn't deal with the situation and left instead of escalating to a manager.\n\nThe question is whether the person is in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the employee was incorrect in the price and weight, and the person was correct in pointing that out. The employee's response was uncooperative, which might have led to the person's frustration. The person did try to resolve it politely but the employee was unhelpful. So, leaving might be a reaction to the employee's poor service.\n\nOn the other hand, the person could have escalated the issue to a manager or at least confirmed the correct price and weight before leaving. By walking out without resolving it, they might have left the employee confused, but maybe the employee was already at fault for the mistake and poor handling.\n\nBut the person's main issue was the employee's behavior. The employee said the price increased but didn't update the sign, which is the store's responsibility. Then when the person pointed out the weight, the employee questioned it, which could be a mistake on the employee's part. The person was trying to correct them but the employee wasn't acknowledging it, leading to frustration. \n\nThe person left because they couldn't deal with the situation, not because they were wrong. The employee was in a position to correct the error, but the person was just a customer trying to get the right product. So maybe the person isn't in the wrong because the employee was being unhelpful. However, leaving without resolving it might be considered rude, even if justified.\n\nBut the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No). Considering that the employee made the mistake and was uncooperative, the person might not be in the wrong. But the act of leaving without saying a word could be seen as abandoning the employee, which is unkind. However, the employee was the one who was incorrect. \n\nIn the end, it's a judgment call. The person was correct in pointing out the mistake, the employee was wrong. The person's frustration is understandable. Leaving might be a bit abrupt, but not necessarily wrong. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
