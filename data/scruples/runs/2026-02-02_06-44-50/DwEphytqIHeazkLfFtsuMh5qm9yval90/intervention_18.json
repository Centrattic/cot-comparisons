She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter interaction where the customer got charged a higher price and more weight than intended, and then left without saying a word.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The customer ordered 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave 1.745lbs at $6.98/lb, which is three times the price. The customer pointed out the mistake, the employee said the price had increased but hadn't updated the sign. Then there's a back-and-forth about the weight. The employee takes the meat back, rebags it by cutting slices, and the customer leaves without paying the corrected amount or talking to a manager.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. \n\nFrom the customer's perspective, they might feel wronged because they were overcharged. They tried to resolve it politely, but the employee's actions (like cutting meat and not explaining clearly) escalated the situation. The customer's frustration led them to leave, which could be seen as abandoning the employee with the problem.\n\nFrom the employee's side, perhaps there was a pricing error or miscommunication. The employee might have made a mistake in applying the correct price or weight. The customer's abrupt departure without resolving the issue could be unprofessional and leave the employee in a tough spot, especially if the customer didn't pay the correct amount or report the issue to a manager.\n\nKey points: The customer was overcharged, but they left without completing the transaction. The employee might have made an error, but the customer's reaction was to walk out. Ethically, the customer should resolve the issue by either paying the correct amount or speaking to a manager. Leaving without addressing it could be considered wrong because they didn't follow up properly. However, the employee's handling of the situation (not updating the sign, not clearly communicating the price change) might have contributed to the problem.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, the customer's frustration is understandable, but walking out without a resolution might be seen as abandoning the problem. The correct course of action would be to insist on speaking to a manager or at least ensuring the correct charge. By leaving, the customer avoided confrontation but didn't resolve the issue, potentially leaving the employee to handle it alone. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the customer is in the wrong because they left without properly addressing the issue, even if the employee made a mistake. The customer should have followed up with a manager to resolve the pricing discrepancy instead of just leaving the employee with the meat and the problem.\n"
