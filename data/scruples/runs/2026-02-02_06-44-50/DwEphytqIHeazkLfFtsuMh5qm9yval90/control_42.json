She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli without saying a word after a confusing interaction. Let me go through the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the author goes to the deli to buy turkey meat. They ask for 1lb at $3.98 per pound. The employee slices the meat, asks if it's okay if it's a bit over, and the author agrees. But when the author checks the price, it's $12.18 for 1.745 lbs at $6.98/lb. That's a significant price difference. The author points out the mistake, and the employee claims the price has increased but the sign wasn't updated. The author then mentions the weight is over a pound, which the employee checks. The employee then starts cutting slices into halves to make the weight closer to 1lb, which seems counterintuitive. The author is frustrated and walks out without saying anything else.\n\nSo, the key points here are the pricing error and the employee's handling of the situation. The author noticed the mistake and tried to correct it, but the employee's response was confusing. The employee's method of reducing the weight by tearing slices in half seems impractical and possibly inefficient. The author walked out due to frustration, which is a common reaction when dealing with customer service issues. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The author didn't confront the employee aggressively but pointed out the error. The employee's actions of cutting the meat into smaller pieces might have been an attempt to fix the weight, but it led to further confusion. The author's decision to leave might be seen as a personal choice, especially since they were already frustrated. However, leaving without addressing the issue could be seen as not following up properly, but the author mentions they didn't want to escalate it by talking to the manager. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the employee made a pricing error, and the author tried to correct it. The employee's response was unhelpful. The author walking out might not be the best approach, but it's not necessarily wrong given the situation. The author is not in the wrong for being frustrated, especially when the employee's actions didn't resolve the issue. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
