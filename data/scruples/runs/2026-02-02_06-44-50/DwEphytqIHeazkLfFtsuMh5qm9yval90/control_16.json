She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is at a deli, the customer asked for 1lb of turkey meat, which is supposed to be $3.98 per pound. The deli girl gave them 1.745 lbs but charged the higher price of $6.98 per pound instead of the listed $3.98. The customer pointed out the mistake, the girl said the price has increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then the customer was confused because they were told \"a little over\" the pound, but the weight was almost two. The girl took the meat back and tried to weigh it again by putting 2 slices and half another slice into a new bag, which probably didn't add up correctly. The customer then left without saying anything.\n\nFirst, the customer's actions: They noticed the discrepancy in price and weight. They politely told the employee about the mistake. The employee's response was that the price has gone up, but the sign wasn't changed. The customer then tried to explain that the weight was almost double what they asked for. The employee started reweighing, but maybe did it incorrectly. The customer got frustrated and left without further confrontation. \n\nThe question is whether the customer is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The customer was trying to get a pound of meat at a specific price. The employee gave more than a pound but charged the higher price, which might not be correct. If the price per pound was increased but the sign wasn't updated, the customer might be paying more than intended. But the customer asked for a pound and got 1.745 lbs. If the higher price is for a different type of slicing or portion, maybe the employee misunderstood. \n\nThe customer's irritation is understandable when the employee didn't seem to grasp the issue. The employee's initial response that the price had gone up but the sign wasn't changed is a bit confusing. If the original request was at the old price, the customer might be correct in pointing out the mistake. But the employee could be trying to adjust. When the customer pointed out the weight, the employee started reweighing, but perhaps not properly. \n\nThe customer left without finishing the interaction. Was that wrong? If the employee was making an error in the price or weight, the customer has a right to correct it. However, just walking out might not resolve the issue. The customer might have been right to want to buy the correct amount at the correct price. The employee's confusion could be due to a training issue or mistake. \n\nBut the customer did try to address the problem politely. The employee's response to the weight issue was to rebag the meat. If the employee is genuinely confused or making another mistake, the customer might not be at fault. The title says they left the girl \"holding a pile of meat without saying a word,\" which is the key point. However, the customer had already explained the mistake, and the employee didn't seem to fix it correctly. \n\nIn terms of the customer's responsibility, they have a right to be informed and to correct billing errors. The employee's actions might have been inadequate, and the customer's decision to leave could be a result of frustration with the situation. But is leaving in the middle of the interaction wrong? If the customer felt that the employee wasn't resolving the issue and didn't want to escalate it further, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, the customer could have tried to speak to a manager. But they didn't want to be \"that guy,\" which is a common consideration. The key is whether the customer acted appropriately in pointing out the mistake and then leaving. The employee's initial error in charging the wrong price might be the store's fault, and the customer's attempt to correct it was valid. \n\nSo the customer wasn't necessarily in the wrong. They were dealing with a confusing situation and perhaps an untrained employee. The employee's response was unhelpful, and the customer's frustration is reasonable. Therefore, the answer might be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
