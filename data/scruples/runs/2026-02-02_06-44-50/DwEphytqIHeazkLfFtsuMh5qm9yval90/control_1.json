She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is at a deli counter. The person asked for 1 lb of turkey meat, which is supposed to be $3.98 per pound. The deli worker gives them 1.745 lbs but charges them at $6.98 per pound, totaling $12.18. The person points out the mistake, the worker says the price has increased but hasn't updated the sign. The person gets irritated, points out the weight discrepancy, and the worker starts rebagging it with very few slices. The person then leaves without saying a word.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They wanted to buy meat at a specific price, got overcharged, and faced a confusing interaction. The worker didn't correct the price initially and then tried to adjust the weight in a way that seemed unsatisfactory. The author felt overwhelmed and left, not wanting to escalate by asking for the manager.\n\nThe deli worker's actions: She might have made a pricing error, didn't correct the sign, and then tried to adjust the weight. It's possible she was trying to fix the issue by reducing the amount but maybe did it in a way that wasn't clear. However, the author noticed the weight discrepancy and the incorrect price.\n\nLegal or ethical standpoint: The store overcharged for the product. The customer pointed out the mistake, which is reasonable. If the worker admitted the error and tried to correct it, the customer might have accepted. But the method of correction (cutting slices) wasn't satisfactory. The customer's frustration is understandable. Walking out might be seen as not giving the worker a chance to fix it, but the interaction was already tense.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they did point out the mistake and tried to resolve it. When the worker tried to adjust, it didn't resolve the issue, leading to their frustration. Leaving without a word might be abrupt, but it's not necessarily wrong. The worker was responsible for the pricing error. The customer's main issue was being overcharged and not getting the correct weight. Their response was a reaction to the worker's inadequate handling of the mistake.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because the author wasn't in the wrong for pointing out the mistake and leaving when the situation wasn't resolved properly. The store made an error, and the customer was justified in seeking a correct resolution. The worker's actions were part of the problem, so the customer's exit was a reasonable response given the frustration and lack of resolution.\n"
