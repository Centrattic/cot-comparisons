She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The story is about someone at a deli counter who ends up with a much more expensive and heavier piece of meat than intended, and then leaves the confused employee with a pile of meat after a tense interaction.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee sliced it, asked if it's okay if it's a bit over, which the author agreed. But the final weight was 1.745lbs at $6.98/lb, which is more expensive. The employee explains the price increase, and the author points out the weight issue. The employee then rebags, but the author gets frustrated and leaves without paying or addressing the situation.\n\nNow, the key points here. The employee made an error in pricing and weight. The author noticed and tried to correct it, but the employee was dismissive. The author became irritated, and instead of resolving the issue (like talking to a manager), they left. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe employee's actions: They sliced more than 1lb, applied the wrong price, and then tried to explain it away. Their response to the customer's concern was defensive. The customer's actions: They tried to point out the mistake, but when the employee didn't correct it, they lost patience and left. \n\nIs the author wrong for leaving? Well, the author did not pay for the correct amount and walked out, leaving the deli with the meat. That's a problem because the customer didn't resolve the issue properly. Even if the employee was at fault, the author should have either tried to resolve it (like with a manager) or not taken the product. Walking out without paying is not acceptable. However, the employee was also in the wrong for the pricing mistake. \n\nBut the main issue here is the author's action of leaving the meat and not paying. That's where the wrong lies. The author should have addressed the issue further, even if they were frustrated. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't handle the situation correctly by leaving the product and not resolving the issue properly.\n"
