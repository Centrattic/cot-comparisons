She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused after a pricing dispute.\n\nFirst, the situation: The writer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745lbs, but charged $6.98/lb instead. The writer pointed out the mistake, the employee tried to correct it by taking out some meat, but the writer got frustrated and left without saying a word.\n\nSo, the main points here are the pricing error and the writer's reaction. The employee made a mistake by applying the higher price without updating the sign. The writer tried to correct it politely but became increasingly irritated. The employee's actions in removing meat might have been confusing, leading to the writer's loss of patience.\n\nNow, the question is whether the writer is in the wrong for leaving abruptly. The writer's frustration is understandable given the confusion and possible overcharging. However, walking out without communicating further could leave the employee puzzled. But considering the writer's intention to buy groceries and not cause a scene, their actions might be seen as a last resort after failed attempts to resolve the issue politely. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the employee made the initial error, but the writer's response, while abrupt, might be justified if they felt the situation couldn't be resolved without escalating. The writer isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own time and not wanting to escalate the issue further. The key here is whether the writer's actions were proportionate. Since they tried to address it politely and then left without confrontation, it's more about personal frustration than being a jerk. So the answer is B.\n"
