She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl in a confused state after a pricing mistake. The situation is that the customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98, but the employee charged them $6.98 per pound, resulting in 1.745lbs for $12.18. The customer pointed out the mistake, the employee was confused and started re-weighing, but the customer just walked out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the customer's actions. They politely mentioned the mistake, got a response that the price was raised but the sign wasn't updated. Then they said they wanted a pound, and the employee had over 1.7 pounds. The employee then took the meat out, rebagged it with fewer slices, but the customer left without saying anything. \n\nThe key points here are: Did the customer handle the situation appropriately? The customer was likely frustrated because they were overcharged, and the employee didn't understand the issue. The customer didn't escalate to a manager, which is common in such cases. But they left the employee with the meat and the basket. \n\nFrom the customer's perspective, they might have felt that the employee wasn't helpful enough. The employee didn't immediately correct the mistake, maybe because of the confusion in the process. The customer didn't confront the manager, possibly to avoid confrontation, but their action of walking out left the employee in a difficult spot, having to figure out what to do with the leftover meat and the basket. \n\nOn the other hand, the employee's mistake was in the pricing and weight. The customer is correct in pointing out the error. However, the way they left might be seen as rude because they didn't follow through on resolving the issue, even if they were frustrated. The employee might have been embarrassed or confused, and the customer leaving without a word could add to her stress, especially if she's new or not trained properly.\n\nBut the customer did try to correct the mistake politely. The employee's response that the price had gone up but the sign wasn't updated explains the discrepancy. The customer then pointed out the weight was over a pound, leading to the employee's confusion. The customer might have felt that the employee was either lying about the price change or not handling the situation correctly. Since they didn't want to escalate, walking out could be their way of dealing with the overcharge, but maybe they should have at least left the basket or the meat there properly.\n\nThe question is if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is the customer's decision to walk out without resolving the situation. While the employee made a mistake, the customer could have handled it more diplomatically. By leaving the meat and basket, the deli girl has to deal with the mess and confusion, which isn't fair. However, the customer was within their right to question the price and seek a correction. If the employee intended to correct it, the customer's departure might have been abrupt. But if the employee's actions didn't address the overcharge, maybe the customer felt they couldn't wait. \n\nThe customer's frustration is understandable, especially with the thick slices leading to a heavier weight than asked. But the act of leaving without explanation or return of the basket could be seen as inconsiderate. The right thing might have been to either wait while the employee sorted it out or to inform the manager upon exit. Since the customer left the employee in a tough spot, maybe AITA is yes. But I need to decide if the author is in the wrong. The answer is likely A (yes), because even if the employee made a mistake, the customer could have been more cooperative. Leaving the employee without clear instructions on how to handle the situation isn't ideal. The customer didn't have to take the meat but could have returned it politely and walked out. Alternatively, if the customer felt they were being overcharged, they might have left the meat on the counter and exited. But the way it's described, they just walked out, leaving the employee with the basket and meat. That's probably inconsiderate. So the author is in the wrong.\n"
