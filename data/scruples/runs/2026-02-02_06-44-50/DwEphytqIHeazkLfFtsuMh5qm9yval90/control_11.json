She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is the asshole for leaving without saying anything. So, the situation is at a deli. The person asked for 1lb of turkey, which is priced at $3.98 per pound. The employee gave them 1.745 lbs, but charged at $6.98 per pound, which is way more expensive. The customer pointed out the mistake, the employee said the price had gone up but hadn't updated the sign. Then the customer argued about the weight, and the employee took the meat back, tried to repackage it with only a couple slices.\n\nThe user is asking if the author (the customer) is in the wrong for just walking out. Let's break this down. First, the customer noticed the price discrepancy and tried to correct it. The employee might have made an error in pricing or weight. The customer was polite initially, then became irritated when the employee didn't acknowledge the weight issue. The employee then took the meat back and tried to repackage it, but the customer left without further discussion.\n\nSo, is the customer wrong? Well, they tried to address the issue, but when the employee didn't resolve it, they left. They weren't confrontational beyond pointing out the mistake. The employee's actions (repackaging in a way that seems to avoid the weight) might have contributed to the customer's frustration. Walking out could be seen as abrupt, but considering the employee's response, maybe the customer felt they couldn't get a resolution. The key points are whether the customer acted unreasonably or if the employee was at fault.\n\nThe customer didn't escalate to yelling or causing a scene. They just left. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong. The employee likely made a mistake, and the customer tried to handle it but couldn't. Walking out is a personal choice, and the customer was trying to avoid being that guy who argues further. So the wrong here might be on the employee for the pricing error and not handling the customer's concern properly. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole.\n"
