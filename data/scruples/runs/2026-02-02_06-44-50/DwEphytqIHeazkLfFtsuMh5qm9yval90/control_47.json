She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a deli counter interaction where the employee charged the wrong price and weight for the turkey meat.\n\nFirst, the customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee sliced it and said it's okay if it's a bit over. But the customer ended up being charged $12.18 for 1.745lbs at $6.98/lb. The customer pointed out the mistake, and the employee corrected it by taking out some meat and reweighing it. However, the customer felt the employee was being unprofessional, leading them to leave without saying a word.\n\nThe key points here are the employee's mistake in pricing and weight, the customer's polite correction, and the employee's response. The customer then left without confronting the employee further. The question is whether the customer is in the wrong for walking out.\n\nThe customer's actions: They noticed the error, pointed it out politely, and then lost patience when the employee was slow in addressing it. They left without saying a word, which might be seen as abrupt. But they also didn't argue or cause a scene, just left.\n\nThe employee's actions: The employee initially charged the higher price without informing the customer, then corrected it by removing some meat but did so slowly and perhaps unprofessionally, leading to the customer's frustration.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the employee made a mistake in pricing and weight, which is on the store. The customer tried to correct it but got frustrated. The customer leaving without a word might be considered impolite, but given the circumstances, it's understandable. The customer isn't wrong for not wanting to deal with the employee's slow or incorrect handling. The main issue was the employee's mistake, so the customer isn't in the wrong for leaving in that situation. The answer is B.\n"
