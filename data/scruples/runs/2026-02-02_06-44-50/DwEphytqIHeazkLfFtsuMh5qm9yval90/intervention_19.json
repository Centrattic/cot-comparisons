She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter interaction where the customer ended up leaving without finishing the transaction.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee sliced it, and the customer agreed to a little over. But the final weight was 1.745 lbs at $6.98/lb, which is more expensive. The customer pointed out the mistake, the employee said the price changed but didn't update the sign. Then, when the customer noted the weight was over a pound, the employee took the meat back and tried to repackage it by cutting slices, leading the customer to leave without paying.\n\nSo, the customer is upset because the price was higher than expected and the weight was wrong. The employee might have made a mistake with the pricing or the weight. The customer tried to address it politely but got frustrated and walked out without paying.\n\nI need to determine if the customer is in the wrong. The key points are: Did the customer have a right to leave without paying? Was there a mistake by the store? The employee might have been incorrect about the price increase. The customer tried to correct the weight but got an unsatisfactory response. The customer didn't escalate to a manager, which is a common practice. However, the customer did attempt to address the issue but lost patience. \n\nLeaving without paying could be considered wrong because the customer didn't resolve the issue properly. However, if the store was at fault (wrong price, incorrect weight), maybe the customer had reason to be upset. But walking out without paying might leave the store in a worse position. The customer could have asked to speak to a manager or returned later. The employee's behavior (tearing slices, not explaining clearly) might have contributed to the conflict. \n\nThe customer's actions: tried to point out the mistake, got ignored or given incorrect info, then walked out. Not paying is a problem. The store might have overcharged, but the customer's response was to abandon the purchase. Depending on perspective, the customer might be in the wrong for not following up properly. Alternatively, if the store made a clear mistake, maybe the customer was justified. But legally, leaving without paying is problematic regardless of the situation. So the answer might be A (author is wrong) because they didn't resolve the issue properly and left without payment, even if there was a store error.\n"
