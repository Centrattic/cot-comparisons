She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. First, let me recap the situation. The author went to a deli, asked for 1lb of oven roasted turkey at $3.98 per pound. The employee sliced it, checked if it was okay if it was a little over, which the author agreed to. But then the total came out to $12.18 for 1.745 lbs at $6.98 per pound. The author pointed out the mistake, the employee said the price had gone up but didn't change the sign. The author was confused because the weight was almost double what they asked for. The employee then took the meat back, repackaged it with only a few slices, and tried to charge the higher rate. The author got frustrated, left their basket, and walked out.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The main points are the pricing error, the weight discrepancy, and the author's reaction.\n\nFirst, the employee made a mistake in pricing. The sign said $3.98, but the actual price was $6.98. The employee admitted the price had increased but didn't update the sign. That's an honest mistake on the store's part, but the customer is supposed to be protected from such errors. The author is within their rights to question the price discrepancy.\n\nThen, when the author pointed out the weight was over a pound, the employee tried to adjust the meat. Instead of giving a full pound at the correct price, she took back the meat and gave a much smaller portion, which would be under a pound. The author noticed that the slices were extremely thin (half a DVD case) which might have contributed to the weight discrepancy. But when the employee repackaged it, she put only a few slices, which would be less than a pound. That seems like she's trying to charge the higher price for less product, which is potentially dishonest. The author is right to be concerned about that.\n\nThe employee's response was unhelpful and possibly misleading. When the author pointed out the weight on the label, the employee asked where it was written, showing a lack of attention or maybe trying to avoid the issue. Then, when repackaging, she took out the meat and put only a few slices, which would be less than a pound. The author was confused because they had agreed to a little over a pound initially, but that was at the wrong price. The employee might be trying to adjust the weight to match the higher price, but without clarifying the situation properly.\n\nThe author's reaction was to leave in frustration. They didn't engage further, didn't ask to speak to a manager, just walked out. The question is whether that's reasonable. The employee's behavior was unprofessional and possibly deceptive. The author was trying to correct the mistake but was met with resistance and perhaps a worse situation (getting less product for a higher price). Walking out in that scenario might be understandable, especially if the author felt that the employee wasn't addressing the issue properly and was instead trying to overcharge them.\n\nHowever, the author could have taken other steps, like asking to speak to a manager or at least ensuring that the correct amount and price were applied. But given the employee's behavior, which seems to be part of the problem, the author might have felt that further interaction was pointless or would be a waste of time. Also, the author mentions they \"didn't wanna be that guy,\" implying they prefer to avoid confrontation, but in this case, it's a legitimate issue.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the store's employee made a mistake with the price and then tried to adjust the product in a way that might not be in the customer's favor. The author was a victim of the error and the employee's unhelpful response. The author's frustration is justified, and walking out as a result of the employee's incompetence isn't necessarily wrong. However, the author could have handled it more professionally by either staying to resolve the issue or escalating it. But since the employee's actions were the root of the problem, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset and leaving.\n"
