She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is the asshole for leaving a deli employee holding the meat without saying a word.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98, but the employee charged them $6.98 per pound, resulting in a 1.745lb package priced at $12.18. The employee said the price had gone up but the sign wasn't updated. The author pointed out the weight was over a pound, leading to some back and forth. The employee then took the meat, rebagged it by cutting slices, and tried to give it back. The author left without resolution.\n\nI need to assess if the author is wrong. The key points are whether the author handled the situation appropriately. The employee made a mistake with the price and the weight. The author noticed and tried to correct it. The employee didn't acknowledge the weight discrepancy, just focused on the price. The author got upset and left. \n\nIs the author wrong for not staying to resolve the issue? Well, the employee was being dismissive and not addressing the weight issue. The author might have felt it was pointless to continue, especially if they were already frustrated. Walking out could be seen as impolite, but given the employee's response, maybe the author had a right to be upset. \n\nHowever, the proper course of action might have been to ask for a manager or clarify the pricing again. The author chose not to escalate, which is understandable, but leaving the meat behind could cause confusion for the employee. The question is about the author's right to be upset and whether their reaction is in the wrong. \n\nThe employee's actions were incorrect in both price and weight. The author tried to discuss it but the employee was uncooperative. In such cases, people might have different reactions. The author's frustration is valid, but not communicating clearly when leaving might make it seem abrupt. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they were dealing with a mistake and the employee wasn't helpful. The answer is B.\n"
