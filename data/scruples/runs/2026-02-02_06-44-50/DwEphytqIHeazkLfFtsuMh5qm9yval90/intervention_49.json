She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused after a pricing issue. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author went to the deli to get turkey meat at $3.98 per pound. The employee initially sliced it and said it might be a bit over, but then the author got a package that was 1.745 pounds priced at $6.98 per pound, totaling $12.18. The author pointed out the mistake, and the employee tried to explain the price increase but didn't adjust the weight. The author then left without speaking further.\n\nSo, the key points here: the employee made an error in pricing, possibly due to the sign not being updated. The author noticed the mistake and tried to point it out. The employee then attempted to fix it by taking out more meat, but the author was clearly frustrated and left.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is, but I need to form my own opinion. \n\nThe employee's mistake led to overcharging. The author tried to bring it up politely. The employee then tried to correct it, but maybe not in the right way. The author, feeling frustrated, left without further communication. \n\nIs it the author's responsibility to stay and handle it? Or is it the employee's responsibility to handle the pricing error? The author was in the right to question the incorrect charge. However, the way they left, without communication, might be considered abrupt. But considering the employee's confusion and the stress of the situation, maybe the author's reaction is understandable.\n\nI think the main issue is the employee's error. The author is not wrong for pointing out the mistake. The employee should correct their error, not the customer. The author's frustration is valid, especially if they felt the situation was being mishandled. Walking out might be rude, but the alternative is to deal with it, which might not be the author's responsibility. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to be careful here. The employee made the mistake, and the author tried to bring it up. The author's action of leaving could be seen as not being patient, but the employee was also making the situation worse. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
