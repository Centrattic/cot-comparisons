She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is at a deli where the customer asked for 1 pound of turkey meat, which is supposed to be $3.98 per pound. The deli girl gave them 1.745 pounds but priced it at $6.98 per pound, making the total $12.18. The customer points out the mistake, and the deli girl explains that the price increased but the sign wasn't updated. The customer is frustrated because they were given a much larger quantity than requested, and the employee is being slow and unhelpful. The customer then leaves without saying anything more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the customer's actions. They went to the deli, asked for a specific weight and price, got a different weight and higher price. They politely pointed out the mistake, and the employee tried to correct it but in a time-consuming way. The customer then left in frustration. \n\nThe key points here are whether the customer's reaction was justified. The deli girl made a pricing error that cost the customer more money. The customer tried to address it politely but became frustrated with the employee's response and the process of correcting it. Walking out might be seen as rude, but is it the customer's fault? \n\nOn one hand, the customer was paying for more meat than they asked for because the employee either didn't check the weight properly or there was a pricing error. The customer had the right to question the discrepancy. However, the method of handling it is important. The customer didn't argue but tried to resolve it, but the employee's initial response of saying the price had gone up might have been misleading. \n\nWhen the customer pointed out the weight, the employee took the meat and started rebagging it, but the process was slow and confusing. The customer, perhaps feeling time-pressed or annoyed by the employee's demeanor, decided to leave. Is it reasonable to expect the customer to wait while the employee corrects the mistake, even if it takes time? Or was the customer justified in not wanting to deal with the hassle, especially if the employee was being uncooperative or slow?\n\nAlso, the customer mentioned not wanting to be \"that guy\" who asks to speak to the manager. So they handled it themselves. The question is whether walking out without a word is acceptable. The customer did point out the mistake, but the employee didn't seem to understand initially. After the correction, the customer left. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the deli made an error. The customer tried to correct it but became irritated. The employee's behavior might have contributed to the situation escalating. The customer's right to be upset is valid, but the way they left could be seen as abrupt. However, given the employee's apparent confusion and the customer's frustration, maybe it's a split decision. \n\nI think the main issue is that the deli is at fault for the pricing error, but the customer's leaving without a word might be considered rude. However, the customer did try to address it and may have felt the employee wasn't cooperating. So maybe the customer isn't in the wrong for leaving in that situation, even if it wasn't the politest way. But I need to decide between A and B. If the customer is not in the wrong (B), it's because their frustration was justified and the deli's error warranted their action. If A, then they should have handled it more patiently. \n\nHmm. The employee's actions could have been more efficient and helpful, leading to the customer's frustration. The customer's leaving might be a result of the employee's poor service. So the customer isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
