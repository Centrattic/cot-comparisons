She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused after a price discrepancy.\n\nFirst, the situation: the customer ordered turkey at $3.98/lb but was given 1.745 lbs at $6.98, totaling $12.18. The deli employee initially said there was a price increase but hadn't updated the sign. When the customer pointed out the weight was over a pound, the employee took the meat back, tried to rebag it with just a few slices, and then the customer left without saying anything.\n\nThe key points here are the employee's responsibility vs. the customer's reaction. The employee made a mistake in pricing and weight. The customer noticed and tried to correct it politely. The employee then tried to adjust the weight, but the customer lost patience and left, not wanting to escalate the issue to a manager.\n\nNow, considering the actions: the customer did point out the mistake and attempted to resolve it. The employee's actions of removing meat and rebagging in a haphazard way (putting 2 slices, tearing another) might have been unprofessional or inconsiderate. The customer's frustration is understandable here, especially if the employee was not handling the correction properly. \n\nHowever, the customer's final action was to leave without communicating further. The question is whether that's wrong. Arguably, the customer was trying to avoid conflict and didn't want to argue. On the other hand, not addressing the issue might leave the employee confused or not learn from the mistake. But the main issue is the price discrepancy. The customer might have been within their rights to leave since the employee was at fault for the error. \n\nIn many cases, when a customer points out an error and the employee is not handling it correctly, the customer can choose to either let it go or escalate. The customer here chose to leave, which could be seen as justified if the employee's behavior was unhelpful. However, the customer didn't say anything, which might leave the employee in the dark about the problem. But maybe the customer's frustration was due to the employee's initial mistake and the messy way of correcting it. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the employee made the mistake, the customer tried to correct it, but the employee's response was inadequate. The customer's exit might be a reasonable reaction to the situation, especially if they were trying to avoid further conflict. Therefore, the customer (AITA) might not be in the wrong here, as the employee's actions contributed to the situation. The answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
