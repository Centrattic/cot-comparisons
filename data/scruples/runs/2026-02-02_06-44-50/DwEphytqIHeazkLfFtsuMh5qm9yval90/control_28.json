She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused after an argument over the price and weight of the turkey meat. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author went to the deli, asked for 1 pound of turkey at $3.98 per pound. The employee made a mistake, giving 1.745 pounds but charged at $6.98 per pound. The author noticed the discrepancy and pointed it out. The employee tried to justify it by saying the price had gone up, but the author was concerned about the weight. The employee then took the meat, tried to repackage it, but the author got frustrated and left without saying anything.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the employee's actions first. The employee made a pricing error and possibly gave too much product. The author was correct in pointing out both the price and weight issues. The employee's response about the price sign not being updated might be valid, but the weight was over by almost 70%, which is significant.\n\nThe author tried to resolve the issue by pointing out the mistake but became upset when the employee didn't handle it properly. The employee then started repackaging the meat, but in a way that might have been messy or not addressing the core issues (price and weight). The author's frustration led to walking out without further confrontation.\n\nIs the author at fault for leaving? Well, the employee was incorrect in the price and the weight. The author had a right to question the mistake. However, the author left abruptly, which might have left the employee confused, but the employee was already being uncooperative. The author's intention was to buy groceries, and they felt the situation was unresolvable. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the employee was at fault for the error, but the author's response was to leave rather than escalate. Since the author was correct in their initial concern and the employee wasn't addressing the issues properly, the author's action, while abrupt, might be understandable. The key is whether the author had a duty to communicate better. The author did point out the mistake, the employee didn't resolve it, and the author left. So the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for themselves when the employee wasn't helping. So answer B, No.\n"
