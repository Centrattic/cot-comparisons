She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is at a deli counter where the customer (the author) orders 1 lb of turkey meat at $3.98 per lb. The employee slices the meat, and when the customer checks, the weight is 1.745 lbs priced at $6.98 per lb. The customer points out the discrepancy, and the employee says the price increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then she rebags it by cutting the slices to get the weight down. The customer leaves without saying a word, which makes the employee confused.\n\nFirst, the author's main points: They were polite initially, noticed the overcharge, tried to correct it, but then got frustrated with the employee's handling and left. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not dealing with the situation more politely or by not speaking to a manager.\n\nSo, let's break it down. The employee made a mistake in pricing, possibly due to not updating the sign. The author correctly identified the error and tried to address it. The employee's response was defensive, maybe not handling the situation well. The author, after the employee's uncooperative behavior, decided to leave. \n\nNow, the key here is whether the author acted appropriately. The author was polite, tried to resolve the issue, but when the employee was not cooperating, they left. The author didn't escalate to the manager, which might have been a better approach. But they also didn't cause a scene or yell. They just walked out. \n\nIs there a responsibility to go to management? The author might have felt that dealing with an uncooperative employee was not worth the hassle. However, walking out without saying a word could be seen as abrupt. But the employee was left confused, so the author at least attempted to resolve it. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as justified given the employee's behavior. The employee was defensive and perhaps not well-trained. The author's frustration is understandable. While leaving without a word might be a bit harsh, it's not necessarily wrong. The key is intent: the author wanted to buy groceries and didn't want to escalate. \n\nIn terms of the \"AITA\" question, usually, if you attempt to resolve an issue but find the employee isn't helpful, it's acceptable to leave. However, leaving without clarifying or informing someone might be seen as not following up. But in this case, the author did point out the mistake and was told the price had changed. The employee then tried to rebag, but the author lost patience. \n\nSo, the author's actions might be seen as not in the wrong because they tried to address the issue politely and left when the employee wasn't resolving it. Alternatively, some might say they should have gone to a manager. But since the author didn't do any of that, maybe they are in the wrong for not following up.\n\nWait, but the author's main issue is that they couldn't deal with the employee. So, the question is whether the author overreacted. The employee was incorrect on the price, but the author was correct to point it out. The employee's response was unhelpful, leading to the author's frustration. The author left to avoid conflict, which some might consider acceptable. Others might think not following up is wrong. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the judgment is often on intent and actions. The author's actions were to point out the mistake, then leave when the employee wasn't resolving it. The employee was left confused, so the author didn't ignore the situation but found the interaction too frustrating. \n\nI think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the author tried to resolve it, and when that failed, left without causing a scene. The employee's behavior contributed to the situation. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
