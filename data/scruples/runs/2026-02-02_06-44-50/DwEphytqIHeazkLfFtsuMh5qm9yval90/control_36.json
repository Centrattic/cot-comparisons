She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the person went to the deli, asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98 per pound. The deli girl gave them 1.745 lbs but charged $6.98 per pound. The customer pointed out the discrepancy in weight and price. The employee said the price had gone up but the sign wasn't updated. Then the employee tried to rebag the meat by taking out some slices to reduce the weight, but the customer got so frustrated they left without finishing the interaction.\n\nFirst, the employee made a mistake with the weight and the price. The customer was polite when pointing out the issues. The employee's response that the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated might be a valid explanation, but the weight was over by almost a pound. The employee then tried to rebag the meat by removing slices, which might have been confusing. The customer got so frustrated that they left, not saying a word.\n\nIs the customer at fault? Well, they did confront the employee about the mistake, which is reasonable. The employee's actions might have been trying to correct the weight, but the method was unclear. The customer was polite initially but when the employee acted confused, they lost patience. Leaving without finishing the transaction might not be the best approach, but considering the confusion, maybe it's understandable. The key points are whether the customer acted unreasonably. The employee was the one who made the error. The customer's frustration is valid, and while walking out might not be ideal, it's not necessarily the customer's fault. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
