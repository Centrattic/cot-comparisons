She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused after a pricing error. \n\nFirst, the situation: The customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745lbs but charged at $6.98/lb, which is more expensive. The customer points out the mistake, the employee explains the price change, and there's a back-and-forth about the weight. The customer gets frustrated and leaves without finishing the interaction.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? The customer noticed an error and tried to correct it. The employee might have made a mistake in pricing or in the amount given. The customer's frustration is understandable, especially when the employee questions the weight. But the customer walked out without resolving the issue, possibly leaving the employee confused.\n\nThe key points: The customer acted politely at first, but the employee's response led to irritation. The customer didn't escalate it to a manager or find a resolution. However, the customer's actions (leaving abruptly) could be seen as rude. But considering the employee's possible errors, maybe the customer was justified in their frustration. \n\nIn some cases, customers are expected to handle such issues calmly. But if the employee was unhelpful or incorrect, the customer's reaction might be understandable. However, leaving without a resolution might be seen as not taking responsibility to clarify the situation, which could mean the customer is partially at fault. \n\nThe answer likely depends on perspective. If the employee was mistaken, the customer might not be the asshole. But the abrupt departure and not following up could mean the customer is in the wrong. I'm leaning towards the customer being in the wrong because they didn't address the issue properly, even if they were frustrated. So answer A.\n"
