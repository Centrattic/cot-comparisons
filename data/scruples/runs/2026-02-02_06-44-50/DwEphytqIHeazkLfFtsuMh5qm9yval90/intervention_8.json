She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they went to a deli, asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee made a mistake, charged them $6.98/lb for 1.745 lbs. The author points out the error, the employee says the price went up but didn't change the sign. Then when the author mentions the weight, the employee questions that, and starts rebagging. The author gets irritated, leaves without saying a word, and now is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, the employee made a mistake. The author was polite when pointing out the price error. The employee admitted that the price had changed but didn't correct the sign. Then the author noticed the weight was over a pound more than requested. The employee then questions the weight, leading to a conflict. The employee starts rebagging, but the author is upset and just leaves.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author tried to resolve the issue by pointing out the mistake. The employee was either unaware or not helpful. The author's frustration is understandable given that the employee was making it difficult. However, the author walked out without completing the transaction or seeking a resolution. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for leaving without saying a word? Well, they did try to address the issue. The employee's behavior might have been unprofessional, and the author might have felt that escalating the problem (like talking to a manager) was too much. But by walking out, they left the employee with the meat. The question is whether that's acceptable. \n\nIf the author had paid for the correct amount and left, that would be different. But since they left without resolving the issue, maybe the store is out the money. However, the employee made a mistake, so the store might be responsible. The author's frustration is valid, but maybe they should have at least tried to talk to a manager instead of just leaving. However, the author also mentions they didn't want to be \"that guy\" causing a scene. \n\nIn terms of responsibility: The employee was at fault for the mistake, but the author's reaction of leaving without a word could be seen as rude. The author could have stated they were leaving the meat as a gesture, but they just walked out. So maybe the author is partially at fault for not handling it more professionally, but the employee was wrong too. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they tried to address the issue, but didn't complete the transaction, it's tricky. \n\nI think the answer is that the author is not in the wrong because the employee made the mistake and didn't handle it properly. The author's frustration is justified, and walking out is a reaction to the employee's uncooperative behavior. So the answer would be B (No)."
