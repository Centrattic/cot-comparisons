She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for being involved with a married man who hasn't left his wife yet. The man is unhappy in his marriage because his wife has anorexia, depression, and they can't go out to eat. He's trying to find the right time to leave, but hasn't done so yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The woman is in a relationship with a married man. Even if the husband is considering leaving, as long as he's still married, the affair is technically cheating. The woman might say she understands his situation and isn't pushing him, but the main issue is that the marriage hasn't been legally ended yet. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the wife's health. The husband is dealing with a lot, but that doesn't justify the affair. However, the woman might feel it's a mutual escape for the man. But ethically, being in a relationship with someone who is still married is generally considered wrong because it's adultery, regardless of the reasons. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer would likely be A (Yes) because the man is still married, making the relationship extramarital. Even if there's a plan to leave, until the marriage is dissolved, the affair is still considered wrong. The woman's justification that she's not rushing him doesn't change the fact that the relationship is happening during the marriage. \n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms here. In many societies, adultery is frowned upon, so the woman could be seen as at fault. However, some might argue the husband's responsibility for the affair. But the question is specifically about the woman's wrongdoing. \n\nSo the answer is A.\n"
