She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe person is in a secret relationship with a married man. He's unhappy because his wife has anorexia, depression, and they can't go out to eat. He's trying to leave but hasn't yet because he's concerned about his child and his wife's well-being. The question is if the author is at fault for being with him before he leaves.\n\nHmm. Well, infidelity is generally considered wrong because it violates the trust and commitment in a marriage. Even if the husband is unhappy and trying to leave, the affair is still happening while he's still married. The author might be justifying it by saying they understand his situation, but that doesn't excuse the actions. Also, the wife has health issues, which adds a layer of complexity because she's vulnerable. The husband's responsibilities towards his family, especially the child, might be part of his hesitation to leave. But the author is still engaging in a relationship that's extramarital. \n\nI think the key point here is that regardless of the circumstances, being in a relationship with someone who's married makes the author complicit in the marital infidelity. The fact that the husband hasn't left yet means the marriage is still valid, so the author is in the wrong. So the answer should be A.\n"
