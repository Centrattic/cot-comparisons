She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the AITA story is wrong for being with a married man who's planning to leave his anorexic wife. The man is unhappy, the wife has anorexia and depression, and they have a child. The author is dating him secretly, has been for four months, and they're waiting for him to leave his wife. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and ethical aspects here. Adultery is generally considered wrong in many cultures and religions. Even if the man is planning to leave his wife, the affair is happening while he's still married. The wife's condition adds complexity, as she's vulnerable and has a child. The man's intentions matter, but the act of cheating is still occurring regardless of future plans. \n\nAlso, the author is aware of the situation and chose to continue the relationship. They might argue that they're helping him find happiness, but they're also enabling him to avoid responsibility immediately. The wife's health and the child's well-being are factors here. If the man is truly planning to leave, maybe there's a justification, but the timeline is unclear. The author might be in denial about the wrongness of the affair, thinking it's okay because it's temporary. \n\nHowever, from an ethical standpoint, being in a relationship while someone is still married is generally frowned upon. The author could be enabling the man to delay his decision, which might be harmful to his wife and child. The author's role in this situation is questionable because they're complicit in the marital infidelity. Even if the man is unhappy, the author's actions contribute to the breakdown of the marriage before an official separation. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they're engaging in an affair while the man is still married, regardless of his future intentions. The situation doesn't excuse the infidelity, especially considering the vulnerable state of the wife and child. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
