She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the person is in a secret relationship with a married coworker. The man is married but unhappy because his wife has anorexia, depression, and they have a young child. He's planning to leave her but hasn't yet. The author is supporting him and wants him to leave soon but isn't pressuring him.\n\nHmm, adultery is generally considered morally wrong in many societies, even if there are extenuating circumstances. The man is still married, so any relationship with him while he's married is technically cheating. The woman involved might feel they're helping him, but they're still participating in a situation where a marriage is ongoing.\n\nAlso, the man hasn't left his wife yet, so the author is in a relationship with someone who isn't free to be in a relationship. That's a key point. Even if the man is planning to leave, until he actually does, the author is in an adulterous relationship. The fact that the wife has anorexia and they have a child might be seen as complicating factors, but it doesn't necessarily justify the affair. \n\nThe author says they're not rushing him but want him to leave soon. But the fact remains that they're still together while he's married. So the core issue is that the author is in a relationship with someone who isn't divorced yet. That's generally considered wrong, regardless of the reasons. The man's unhappiness and the wife's issues don't absolve the author of responsibility for participating in an affair. \n\nSo the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they are engaged in an extramarital affair while the man is still married. The complications with his wife and child are important, but the act of being in a relationship with a married person is generally seen as unethical.\n"
