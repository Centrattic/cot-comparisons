She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading the situation again. The author is in a secret relationship with a married man who's planning to leave his wife soon. The wife has anorexia, depression, and they have a child together. The man is unhappy and the author supports him but isn't pushing him to leave right away.\n\nFirst, the key points are that the man is still married, so the affair is technically adultery. The author is involved with someone who is currently married, even if there are plans to divorce. The man is in a difficult situation with his wife's health issues, but he's the one who initiated the affair, right? The author is aware that he's married and hasn't left his wife yet but is still continuing the relationship.\n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, being in a relationship with someone who is married is generally considered wrong because it's cheating. The author is complicit in the man's decision to stay married while having an affair. Even if the man is planning to leave, until that divorce is finalized, the author is in an adulterous relationship. The fact that the wife has anorexia and a child might add complexity, but the main issue is the infidelity.\n\nThe author says they understand the man's situation but still choose to be with him. They might be enabling the man to delay his decision to leave, which could prolong the wife's suffering. Even if the man is unhappy, the affair is still wrong. The author's justification is that the man is trying to leave, but the action of being in a relationship with a married man is still ethically questionable.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the man's family. If the author is in the relationship, it could affect the man's decision-making process, making him prioritize the affair over his responsibilities to his wife and child. Also, the author is at risk if the man's wife finds out, leading to potential emotional and legal consequences.\n\nBut some might argue that the man's situation is complex, and the author isn't the one with an eating disorder or the one staying married. However, the act of cheating is still on both the man and the author. The author's choice to participate in the affair, knowing the man is married, makes them complicit.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because they are in an adulterous relationship. Even if the man plans to leave, the relationship is not ethical until he is divorced. The author's support and continued involvement contribute to the problem. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
