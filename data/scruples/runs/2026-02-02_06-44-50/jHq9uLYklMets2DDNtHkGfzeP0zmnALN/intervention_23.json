She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for being in a relationship with a married man who plans to leave his wife soon. The man is married to someone with anorexia, depression, and they have a child. He's unhappy and considering leaving but hasn't done so yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Adultery is generally considered wrong in many cultures and religions. Even if the married man is planning to leave his wife, the affair is still happening while they're legally married. The author is aware of the situation and is part of the relationship while the man is still married. That might make her complicit in the infidelity.\n\nOn the other hand, the man is in a difficult situation. His wife has serious health issues, and he's dealing with emotional and physical strain. He's trying to find the right time to leave, possibly out of concern for his child and his wife's well-being. The author is supportive but also pushing him to leave soon. However, the key point is that he hasn't left yet, so the marriage is still legally in place. \n\nSome might argue that the author isn't in the wrong because she's not the one who caused the marriage to be in trouble. She's just entering a relationship with someone who's already in an unhappy marriage. But others might say that she's taking advantage of a vulnerable situation and contributing to the breakdown of the existing marriage, even if indirectly.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the wife and child. The wife has anorexia and depression; the man's decision to be with someone else while still married could exacerbate her condition. The child could also be affected by the instability. The author's presence might be making it harder for the man to focus on his wife's needs during this critical time.\n\nAlso, the author is being told she's not in the wrong by some people. But morally, engaging in a relationship while someone is still married is typically seen as wrong, regardless of the circumstances. The fact that the man is planning to leave doesn't change the fact that the marriage is still active.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even if the man's marriage is problematic, the author is participating in an affair while he's still legally married. That makes her complicit in the infidelity. Therefore, she is in the wrong.\n"
