He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for being with a married man who hasn't left his wife yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The man is married, has a child with his wife, she has anorexia, depression, and low sex drive. He's unhappy and trying to leave but hasn't yet. The author is involved in a secret relationship, has been with him for four months, and supports his decision but isn't pushing him to leave.\n\nAdultery is generally considered wrong in most ethical frameworks. Even if the husband is planning to leave, he's still married. The author is part of an affair, which is a breach of his marriage vows. The wife's health issues might complicate things emotionally, but the act of engaging in a secret relationship while married is a red flag regardless of the circumstances.\n\nThe author might argue that the husband is unhappy and trying to do the right thing by staying until he can leave safely. However, the author's participation in the affair while the husband is still married makes her complicit. Even if the husband is planning to leave, the author's actions are deceitful towards his wife and child. The question is whether the author is at fault for continuing the relationship before the husband legally ends his marriage.\n\nIn most moral contexts, being in a relationship with someone who is still married, even if they plan to leave, is considered wrong because it's an extramarital affair. The author is aware of the marriage and is engaging in a relationship that's not consensual with the wife. So, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
