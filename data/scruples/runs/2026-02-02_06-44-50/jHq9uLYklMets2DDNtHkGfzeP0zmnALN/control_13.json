      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is dating a married man who says he'll leave his wife soon. The husband is struggling because his wife has anorexia, depression, and they have a young child. He's unhappy and trying to find the right time to leave. The author supports him but isn't pushing.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the man is still married, the author is having an affair, and the man hasn't left his wife yet. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for being with him before he leaves.\n\nFirst, from a moral standpoint, being in an affair is generally considered wrong because it breaks the trust and commitment of the existing marriage. Even if the husband is unhappy and planning to leave, the author is still involved in a relationship that's not appropriate until he's completely separated. The fact that there's a child involved might add complexity, as the husband is worried about the wife's health and the child's well-being. But that doesn't necessarily justify the affair.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they've been seeing each other secretly for four months. Secret relationships are often a red flag, especially when one person is still married. The author might be enabling the husband's indecision by being with him, possibly delaying his decision to leave his wife properly.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the husband is in a difficult situation with a challenging spouse. But the responsibility isn't on the author to be a partner until things are resolved. The marital status is a key factor here. Until the husband is officially separated or divorced, the relationship is adulterous, which is typically viewed as wrong.\n\nThe author also says they understand his situation and aren't rushing him, but the fact remains that they're in a relationship with someone who isn't free to be in a new one. So, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong. The act of having an affair is ethically questionable regardless of the circumstances, and the author is complicit in the marital infidelity until the husband leaves.\n"
