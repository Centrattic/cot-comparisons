He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person is in a secret relationship with a married man who plans to leave his wife soon. The wife has anorexia, depression, and they have a young child. The man is unhappy and has tried helping his wife but hasn't left yet. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being with him before he leaves.\n\nHmm. Well, infidelity is generally considered wrong in most moral frameworks. Even if the husband is planning to leave, as long as he's still married, the relationship is an affair. The author is complicit in this, even if they understand his struggles. The wife's health issues add complexity, but that doesn't necessarily absolve the author of responsibility. The key point is that the man is still married when the affair started and continued. The author might argue they're helping him find happiness, but the act of being with a married person is ethically questionable regardless of intentions. Also, the wife's situation doesn't make the affair okay. So, the answer is probably A\u2014yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
