He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in this situation is in the wrong for dating a married man who plans to leave his anorexic wife soon.\n\nFirst, the man is married. That's a key point. The woman knows he's married and they've been seeing each other secretly for four months. He's unhappy in his marriage, his wife has anorexia, depression, and they can't go out to eat much. He's trying to leave but hasn't yet because he's worried about his wife getting worse and their child.\n\nThe woman in the story is the one asking if she's at fault. She's told him she wants him to leave soon but isn't rushing him. The question is whether she's in the wrong for being with him before he leaves.\n\nSo, cheating on a spouse is generally considered wrong ethically. Even if the spouse is unhappy or has mental health issues, the married person is still bound by their marriage vows. The woman is engaging in a relationship with someone who is not divorced, which is adultery. From a moral standpoint, most people would say that's wrong. The man's situation is complicated, but the woman is still complicit in the infidelity. She might feel justified because he's planning to leave, but until he does, he's still married. Also, his not having left yet might be because of his responsibilities to his wife and child, but that doesn't excuse the woman's actions. She's choosing to be in a relationship that's extramarital. So the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
