      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's in a secret relationship with a married man who says he's going to leave his wife soon. His wife has anorexia, depression, and they have a young child. The man is unhappy and trying to find the right time to leave his wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating on a spouse is generally considered wrong in many societies because it breaches trust and can cause emotional harm. Even if the married person is planning to leave their spouse, being in a relationship before the divorce is finalized might still be problematic. The author is aware of the man's marital status and his intention to leave, but he hasn't done so yet. \n\nAnother angle is the man's responsibility towards his wife and child. Even if his marriage is unhappy, he's still legally and emotionally committed. The wife has a serious health condition, which complicates things further. The man might be in a difficult situation, but that doesn't necessarily justify the affair. The author's involvement could be seen as taking advantage of his vulnerable position, or perhaps she's also a victim here, but the ethics of the situation still point towards the affair being wrong until the marriage is dissolved.\n\nAlso, the author's own stance is that she wants him to leave soon but isn't rushing him. She's being patient, but the fact remains that she's in a relationship with a married man. The key point here is the marital status. Until the divorce is final, he's still married, and any relationship with another person is considered cheating. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the man is trying to leave, so the author isn't entirely at fault. But the question is about her being in the wrong. Since she's knowingly entering a relationship with someone who is still married, regardless of their intentions, she is participating in an adulterous relationship. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because she's in a relationship with a married man even if they're both waiting for him to leave his wife. The answer should be A.\n"
