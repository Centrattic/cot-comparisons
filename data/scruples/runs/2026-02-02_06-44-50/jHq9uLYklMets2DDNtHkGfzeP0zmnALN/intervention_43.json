He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being with a married man who hasn't yet left his wife, despite his intentions. \n\nFirst, the scenario: The man is married, has an anorexic wife with depression, a young child. He's unhappy and wants out but is waiting for the right time, fearing for his wife's and child's well-being. The author is involved with him secretly, understanding his situation but urging him to leave soon. \n\nSo, the main issue here is the affair. The man is still married, so any relationship with him while he's still legally married is technically an affair. The author is aware of the wife's issues and the man's intentions but is still engaged in a relationship.\n\nNow, morally, cheating is often seen as wrong because it violates the marital vows and can cause harm to the spouse and family. Even if the man is planning to leave, the act of being in a relationship while married is still a betrayal. The author's defense is that they are not rushing him and understand his situation, but the fact remains that they are involved in an extramarital affair.\n\nOn the other hand, the man's situation is complex. His wife has serious health issues, and he's trying to balance his happiness with her well-being. However, the author is still complicit in the infidelity. The author might argue that they are supporting him through a tough time, but that doesn't negate the ethical issues of the affair.\n\nThe key point is that the man is still married when the relationship started. Even if he intends to leave soon, the timing hasn't happened yet. So, while the situation is complicated, the act of being in a relationship with someone who is still married is generally considered wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
