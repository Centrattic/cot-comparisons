He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who started a relationship with a married man is in the wrong. The man says he's going to leave his anorexic wife soon. The author of the question is the person in the affair and is considering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and ethical implications. Being in a relationship with someone who is already married is generally considered cheating, which is widely seen as wrong. Even if the married person is unhappy, the act of engaging in a secret affair is still a betrayal of their spouse and child.\n\nThe man's wife has serious health issues\u2014anorexia, depression, and a lack of sex drive. These are complex and sensitive situations. The fact that the man hasn't left his wife yet, despite being unhappy, means that he's still in a committed marriage legally and emotionally. The author is participating in this affair while he hasn't taken the step to leave, which complicates things further.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the child involved. The man is concerned about leaving the wife alone, which shows he's aware of the responsibilities he has. However, the author is aware of this situation and still chooses to be with him, which could be seen as taking advantage of a vulnerable person's predicament.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the man is in a difficult situation and the author is supporting him. But the key point is that the man is still married, so any relationship with someone else is adulterous. Even if the marriage is unhappy, the author's actions contribute to the man's decision-making process, which could affect his family negatively if he leaves abruptly or if the wife's condition worsens.\n\nI should also consider the societal norms and the potential harm caused to all parties involved. The author's relationship could be causing emotional distress to the wife and child, even if indirectly. The author might not be legally responsible, but morally, they are complicit in the breakdown of the marriage.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because they are engaging in an affair with a married man who hasn't finalized his divorce, which is a breach of trust and could have serious consequences for the family involved.\n"
