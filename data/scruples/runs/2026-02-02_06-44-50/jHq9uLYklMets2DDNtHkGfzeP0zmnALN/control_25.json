He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) who's dating a married man is in the wrong. The man is unhappily married to someone with anorexia, depression, and they have a child. He's planning to leave but hasn't yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of being in a relationship with someone who's still married. Even if the marriage is unhappy or abusive, the person is still legally married. So, the AITA here is technically in an extramarital affair, which is generally considered wrong unless the marriage is already dissolved. The man hasn't left his wife yet, so the marriage is still active.\n\nThe man's reasons for staying are complex, involving his wife's health and their child. However, the AITA's role is to be in a relationship while the husband is still married. Even if the husband is planning to leave, until that happens, the affair remains unethical. The AITA might argue they're supporting his decision to leave, but the act of being with someone while they are still married is still adultery.\n\nAdditionally, the AITA might be enabling the man to delay leaving his wife for personal reasons. Even if the wife has anorexia, the husband should prioritize his responsibilities and seek help, not engage in an affair. The AITA's presence could complicate the situation further, potentially affecting the wife and child.\n\nMoral perspectives vary, but most ethical frameworks would condemn extramarital affairs regardless of the circumstances. The AITA is complicit in the marital infidelity until the husband leaves his wife. Therefore, the answer is A (they are in the wrong).\n"
