      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for being in a relationship with a married man who says he's going to leave his wife soon. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the man is married, and his wife has anorexia, depression, and they have a young child. He's been unhappy and is trying to leave her but is hesitant because of the child and her mental health. The author is seeing him secretly for four months and wants him to leave his wife but isn't pushing him. The question is whether the author is at fault (AITA) for being with him before he leaves.\n\nEthically, being in a relationship with someone who's still married is generally considered wrong because it's infidelity. Even if the married person plans to leave their spouse, the act of being unfaithful while still married is a breach of trust and commitment. The author is aware that he's married and is choosing to be with him anyway, which makes it a conscious decision to engage in an affair.\n\nThe man's situation is complicated. He has a wife with serious health issues and a child, so his decision to leave isn't straightforward. But regardless of his reasons, he's still married, and the author is participating in a relationship that's not monogamous. Some might argue that if he's actively planning to leave and the author is waiting for that to happen, it's different. However, the line is crossed as soon as the affair starts, even if the divorce isn't finalized yet.\n\nThe author also mentions they're not pushing him to leave, which shows they're aware of the complexity, but that doesn't absolve them. The key issue is the infidelity. Whether or not the man is at fault isn't the main point here; the author's role in it is. So, in most moral frameworks, engaging in an affair is considered wrong, so the answer would be A.\n"
