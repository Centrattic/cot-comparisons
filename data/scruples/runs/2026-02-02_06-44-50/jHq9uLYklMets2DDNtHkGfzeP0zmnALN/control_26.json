He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being in a relationship with a married man who hasn't left his wife yet, even though he plans to.\n\nFirst, the man is married, so there's a legal and social contract in place. The author is involved in a secret relationship with him, which is typically considered an affair. Even if the husband is unhappy in his marriage and plans to leave, the fact that he hasn't finalized the divorce yet means he's still married. The author is participating in this relationship while he's still married, which is ethically questionable.\n\nThe husband's wife has anorexia, depression, and they have a child. He's trying to figure out the right time to leave. The author says she wants him to leave soon but isn't rushing him. However, being in a relationship before the divorce is finalized can be seen as taking advantage of his vulnerable situation. The author might be contributing to his emotional turmoil by providing a distraction or complicating his decision to leave.\n\nEthically, most people would say that the author is in the wrong because she's engaging in a relationship that's adulterous while the man is still married. Even if the marriage is unhappy, the relationship is not appropriate until there's a legal separation. Additionally, the author's actions might be prolonging the husband's decision or making it harder for him to leave, especially if he's considering the well-being of his wife and child.\n\nThere's also the emotional aspect. The author is involved in a secret relationship, which can be manipulative and harmful to all parties involved. The husband's wife is dealing with serious health issues, and the author's relationship might be adding stress or guilt to the husband's situation. The child could also be affected once the divorce happens, and having an affair might complicate the family dynamics further.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is likely in the wrong. The key point is that the relationship is occurring while the man is still legally married, regardless of his intentions to leave. The ethical responsibility lies with both parties, but since the author is aware of his marital status and continues the relationship, she shares the blame.\n"
