She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is in a relationship with a married man who hasn't left his wife yet. The man is unhappy because his wife has anorexia and other issues, but he's trying to stay for the child and her health. The author knows about the situation and is waiting for him to leave his wife before fully committing.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is adultery. The man is still married, so any relationship with him while he's married is technically cheating. Even if the man is unhappy and considering leaving, until he's officially divorced, he's still married. The author is aware of this and is still engaging in a secret affair.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, many people would say that the author is in the wrong because they're participating in an adulterous relationship. Even if the man is planning to leave, the act of being with someone who is still married is generally considered unethical. The author's justification might be that they're waiting for him to take action, but the fact remains that the marriage hasn't been dissolved yet.\n\nAdditionally, the author might be exploiting a vulnerable situation. The man's wife has a serious illness, and the author is in a position where they could potentially harm the wife's well-being if the man were to leave suddenly. The author's presence could complicate the man's decisions and add pressure on him to end his current marriage, which might not be in the best interest of the child or the wife.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is also a victim of the man's poor decisions. But regardless of that, the act of being in a relationship with someone who is still married is a breach of trust and can cause significant emotional harm to all parties involved. So, even if the intentions are noble, the action itself is ethically questionable.\n\nTherefore, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
