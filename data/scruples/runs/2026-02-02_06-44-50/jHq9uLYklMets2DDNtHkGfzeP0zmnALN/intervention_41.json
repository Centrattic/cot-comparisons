He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for being involved with a married man who hasn't left his wife yet. The man says he's going to leave soon because his wife has anorexia and other issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is in a relationship with someone who's still married. Even if the man claims he's going to leave, as long as he's still married, the relationship is adulterous. Adultery is generally considered morally wrong in many societies, so that's a point against the author.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the man's situation. His wife has anorexia and depression, and they have a child. He's struggling and hasn't left her. The author acknowledges this but is still involved. The man might be using the author as an emotional crutch while he's in a difficult situation. The author might be contributing to his unhappiness by keeping him in a situation where he can't leave, or perhaps enabling him to avoid making tough decisions.\n\nBut wait, the author says they understand and aren't rushing him. Maybe they're being patient. However, being in a secret relationship with someone who's still married could be seen as taking advantage of his vulnerable state. The author might be making it harder for him to leave because he has this other relationship to consider, complicating his decision.\n\nAnother angle: the wife's health is a serious issue. If the man leaves, she might be at risk, considering her anorexia and depression. The author's involvement might be adding stress. But does that make the author more in the wrong? It's a complex situation where the man's actions (cheating) are also ethically questionable.\n\nLegally, adultery isn't a crime everywhere, but morally, it's a gray area. However, the author is directly involved in a relationship that's extramarital. Even with good intentions, the act itself is a breach of the marital vows. The author might be supporting someone who is already in a morally ambiguous position.\n\nAlso, the author is aware of the wife's condition but still chooses to be with the man. That could be seen as not respecting the wife's situation or the man's marital commitment until he's ready to leave. However, the man hasn't left yet, so the author is technically in an affair.\n\nConsidering all these points, even if the man is unhappy and struggling, the author is engaging in a relationship that's ethically questionable. So, the answer is likely A (in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing, like if the author is helping him or if the man's marriage is beyond repair. However, until he's actually divorced, the author's actions are problematic.\n"
