He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that she's dating a married man who hasn't left his wife yet, but he's planning to because she has anorexia and their marriage is unhappy. He's been trying to be patient and get help for his wife, but she's not improving. The author wants him to leave soon but isn't pushing him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and ethical implications. Cheating on a spouse is generally considered wrong in many cultures and ethical systems because it breaches trust and can cause emotional harm. Even if the married man is unhappy and his wife has health issues, the author is still involved in a relationship that is not consensual from the wife's side. The fact that they're keeping it secret adds to the issue, as it implies deceit.\n\nThe author's justification might be that the husband is planning to leave, so she's just waiting. But that doesn't necessarily absolve her of wrongdoing. The husband is still legally and emotionally tied to his wife, and the author is engaging in a relationship that could be seen as encouraging him to stay in that situation longer. Also, the man might be using the author's presence as a way to cope without actually leaving his wife, which could delay necessary actions for her well-being.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the wife and child. The wife's anorexia and depression are serious conditions, and the husband's decision to leave could affect their treatment and stability. The author's involvement might complicate the situation, making it harder for the husband to make a clean break or for the wife to seek help independently.\n\nEven if the husband is unhappy and the marriage is problematic, the author's role in an affair, especially while the husband is still married, raises questions about her responsibility. She might be contributing to the emotional burden on the wife by not allowing the husband to fully commit to leaving. Also, the author's own actions could lead to legal consequences (like being a third party in a divorce) and personal guilt.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that if the husband is actively seeking to end the marriage, the affair is a result of a failing relationship. But the key point is that the author is knowingly engaging in a relationship with someone who is not free to be in a committed relationship with her. Until the husband actually leaves his wife, the affair is still ethically problematic.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because she's participating in a relationship that is adulterous and involves deceit, regardless of the husband's intentions or the wife's condition.\n"
