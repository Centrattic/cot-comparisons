She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for being in a relationship with a married man who hasn't left his anorexic wife yet. The man says he'll leave soon but hasn't.\n\nFirst, the author is in a secret relationship with a married coworker. The man is unhappy because his wife has anorexia, depression, and they have a child. He's trying to decide when to leave. The question is whether the author is wrong for being with him while he's still married.\n\nThe main ethical issue here is the marital status. The man is still married, so any relationship he's in is adulterous. The author is aware of his marital status and the situation with his wife. Even if the man is planning to leave, until he actually does, he's still married. So the author is engaging in an affair. \n\nThe man's reasons for staying might be compassionate\u2014concern for his wife's health and their child. However, the author is now part of an extramarital affair, which is generally considered unethical. The author might argue they're helping the man leave, but the fact remains that he's still married when the affair started and continues. \n\nThe key point is whether the author is wrong for being in a relationship before the man has officially left his wife. Since the marriage hasn't dissolved, the affair is ongoing. The author's justification that they're patient and support his decision doesn't negate the fact that they're in a relationship with a married person. \n\nSo, considering the situation, the author is in a morally questionable position. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because engaging in a relationship while someone is still married is typically seen as unethical, regardless of the circumstances.\n"
