She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for being in a relationship with a married man who hasn't left his wife yet, despite her having anorexia and other issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and ethical aspects here. The man is married, so the relationship is adulterous. Even if the marriage is unhappy, it's still a breach of marital vows. The wife has significant health issues, which complicates things. The man is considering leaving, but hasn't done so yet. The author is aware of the situation and is waiting for him to leave, but they've already been in a secret relationship for four months.\n\nThe key points are: the relationship is extramarital, the wife has anorexia and depression, the man is trying to find the right time to leave. The author supports him but is also in a relationship that's currently adulterous.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, many people would argue that being in a relationship while someone is still married is wrong. Even if the marriage is unhappy, the act of cheating can cause harm to the spouse and the child. The wife's health issues might make the situation more complex, but the author's actions are still part of the infidelity. \n\nSome might argue that the man is trying to leave, so the author isn't the one keeping him tied down. However, until he actually leaves, the author is participating in an affair. The fact that the wife has anorexia and depression doesn't necessarily absolve the author of responsibility. The author's presence might also affect the dynamics of the man's decisions, perhaps pressuring him to leave sooner than he's ready, which could impact the wife and child negatively.\n\nOn the other hand, if the man is truly unhappy and the marriage is a bad environment, maybe the author is helping him find happiness. But that's a bit of a stretch because the author is still involved in an unethical situation.\n\nI think most people would side with the answer being A (the author is in the wrong) because the relationship is adulterous regardless of the circumstances. Even if there are extenuating factors, the act of cheating is generally considered morally wrong. The author is complicit in the man's decision to stay in the marriage while they're in a secret relationship, which is a form of emotional infidelity and deceit.\n"
