He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being in a relationship with a married man who plans to leave his anorexic wife soon.\n\nFirst, the man is married, so any relationship with him is an affair. That's a big point because most people consider cheating wrong. The man says he's unhappy and trying to leave his wife, but she has an eating disorder and a child. He's scared to leave her alone, which adds complexity.\n\nThe author is aware of the situation and has been patient, not pushing him to leave immediately. They're in a secret relationship. The key here is that the man is still married when the affair started. Even if he's planning to leave, the fact that he's still married at the time of the affair means the author is complicit in the infidelity. \n\nSome might argue that the wife's health issues make the situation more complicated, but that doesn't necessarily absolve the author of wrongdoing. The author chose to be with a married man, which is typically considered unethical. The man's intentions don't change the fact that the relationship began while he was still married. \n\nAlso, the author is aware of the wife's condition and the man's struggles but still chose to engage in the affair. The answer likely hinges on whether the affair is justified by the circumstances. However, most moral frameworks would still hold both parties accountable for the infidelity, regardless of the reasons. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong because they are involved in an affair while the man is still married. The planning to leave doesn't negate the wrong of the affair itself.\n"
