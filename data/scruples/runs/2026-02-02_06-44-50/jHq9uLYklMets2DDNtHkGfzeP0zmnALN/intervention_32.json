      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is dating a married man they work with. They've been seeing each other secretly for four months. The man is unhappy in his marriage because his wife has anorexia, depression, and doesn't have a sex drive. He's trying to leave her but is worried about leaving her alone with their child. The author wants him to leave soon but isn't pushing him. The question is whether the author is at fault for being in a relationship with him before he's officially left his wife.\n\nHmm. Well, cheating is generally considered wrong in most ethical frameworks because it violates the commitment of marriage. The man is still married, so the relationship is adulterous. Even if the man is planning to leave, as long as he's still married, the author is participating in an affair. The author's justification seems to be that the husband is unhappy and the wife has health issues, but that doesn't necessarily absolve the author of responsibility. The author supports the husband's decision to leave, but until he does, the relationship is still extramarital. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not be aware of all the complexities. The husband is in a difficult situation, but the author is still choosing to be with someone who isn't free to be in a relationship. The author's role in enabling or facilitating the affair could be an issue. Even if the author is empathetic to the husband's plight, the act of being in a relationship with a married person is ethically questionable.\n\nSo, considering that, the answer would lean towards A, the author is in the wrong. The key point is that the husband is still married, and the author is in a relationship with him, which is typically seen as cheating. The husband's intentions might be to leave, but until it's done, the author is involved in an affair. The author's support or understanding doesn't negate the fact that the relationship is extramarital.\n"
