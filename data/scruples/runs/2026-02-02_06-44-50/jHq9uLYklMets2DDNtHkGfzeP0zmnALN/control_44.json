He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for being in a relationship with a married man who hasn't left his anorexic wife yet. The man says he's going to leave soon.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Cheating on a spouse is generally considered wrong because it breaks trust and can cause emotional harm. The man is still married, so by being with him, the author is participating in an affair. Even if the husband is unhappy and planning to leave, the fact remains that he's still married when the affair started. The author is aware of the situation but continues the relationship. \n\nNext, the husband's wife has anorexia and other issues. The man is dealing with a difficult situation, but that doesn't justify the affair. The author might feel empathy towards the husband, but that doesn't absolve her of responsibility. The wife's health and the child's well-being are also factors. The husband's decision to leave might come later, but until then, the affair is ongoing.\n\nMoral judgment here is subjective, but in many ethical frameworks, infidelity is a breach of commitment. The author is in a secret relationship that isn't respectful of the husband's current marital vows. The husband's intentions to leave don't change the fact that the author is engaging in a relationship with someone who isn't free to commit. \n\nAdditionally, the author might be enabling the husband's delay in making a decision by being a comfort. The question is whether she's in the wrong. Since the husband is still married, the author's actions contribute to the infidelity regardless of his future plans. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
