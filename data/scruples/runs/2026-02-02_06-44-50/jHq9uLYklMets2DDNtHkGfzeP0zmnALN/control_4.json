She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for being in a relationship with a married man who hasn't yet left his anorexic wife. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The man is married, and the author is in a secret affair with him. He's considering leaving his wife because she has anorexia, depression, and they have a young child. He's been trying to help her but is unhappy. The author supports him but wants him to leave soon.\n\nThe main issue here is that the man is still legally married, so the author is in a relationship with a married person. Even if the wife has health issues, the fact remains that the man hasn't finalized the divorce. In many ethical and legal perspectives, being in a relationship with someone while they're still married is considered cheating. \n\nHowever, there are nuances. The man is unhappy and seeking to leave, which might complicate the situation. But the author is aware of the situation and is involved before the divorce is finalized. The key point is that until the marriage is legally ended, the man is still married, so the affair is on-going. \n\nSome might argue that the author is a \"second\" person in the situation, which can be harmful to all parties involved. The wife is dealing with serious health issues, and the child is part of the equation. The author's involvement could add stress and complicate the man's decision-making process, especially regarding leaving his wife. \n\nEven if the man's marriage is problematic, the author's role in an affair while he's still married makes her complicit in the situation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, most would say yes because the man is not yet divorced, so the relationship is adulterous. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). Even if the circumstances are complex, being in a relationship with a married person is generally considered wrong until the divorce is final.\n"
