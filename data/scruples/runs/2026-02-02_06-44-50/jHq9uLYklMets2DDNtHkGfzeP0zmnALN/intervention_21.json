He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she's in a secret relationship with a married man. He's unhappy because his wife has anorexia, depression, and they have a child. He says he's going to leave her soon, but hasn't yet. The author is asking if she's at fault for being with him before he leaves.\n\nFirst, I need to remember that cheating is generally considered unethical. Even if the married man is unhappy or has a difficult situation, he's still married. The fact that he's trying to leave his wife might make it seem like he's justified or that his current marriage is not ideal, but the act of being unfaithful while still married is typically seen as wrong. \n\nThe author is aware of his marital status and the fact that he hasn't left yet. They've been seeing each other secretly for four months. Even if the man is in a tough spot with his wife's health and their child, the author is participating in an affair. So from a moral standpoint, she's complicit in the infidelity. \n\nThe man's reasons for staying might be complex, but the author's role in starting and maintaining a relationship before the marriage is dissolved could be seen as unethical. The question is whether her actions make her at fault. Since she's knowingly engaging in a relationship with a married man, regardless of his intentions, she's in the wrong. \n\nEven though she says she understands his situation and isn't rushing him to leave, the fact remains that they are in an affair. Society generally condemns infidelity, and the person involved in the affair is also considered at fault. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
