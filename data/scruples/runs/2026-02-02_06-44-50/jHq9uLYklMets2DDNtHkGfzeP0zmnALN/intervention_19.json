He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who started a relationship with a married man is in the wrong. The man is unhappy in his marriage because his wife has anorexia and depression, and he's planning to leave but hasn't yet. The author is in a secret affair and is questioning their own actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of relationships. Generally, being in a relationship with someone who is still married is considered cheating, which is widely seen as wrong. The man hasn't left his wife yet, so he's still legally and emotionally tied to her. The author is aware of the situation and is choosing to be with him anyway, which could be seen as exploiting his marital status or complicating his decision to leave.\n\nEven though the man is in a tough situation with his wife's health and their child, the author is still participating in an affair. The fact that the man hasn't left his wife yet means he's still married, so the author's relationship with him is adulterous. The author's justification might be that they're supporting him through a hard time, but that doesn't change the fact that it's an extramarital affair.\n\nSome might argue that the man's unhappiness and the wife's health issues complicate things, but the core issue is the fidelity of the author. The author is in a relationship with someone who is not free to be in another relationship. The fact that the man hasn't taken action to end his marriage yet is crucial here. Until he's officially divorced, the author's relationship is considered wrong in most societal and ethical standards.\n\nThe author's own statement that they want the man to leave his wife soon but aren't rushing him might indicate some awareness of the situation's complexity, but that doesn't absolve them of wrongdoing. The key point is that the relationship is occurring while the man is still married, regardless of future intentions.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they are engaged in an extramarital affair with a man who is still legally married, even if he plans to leave his wife. The ethical issue here is about the current status of his marriage versus his future intentions.\n"
