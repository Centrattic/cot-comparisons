She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for being with a married man who hasn't left his wife yet. The situation is that the man is married, his wife has anorexia and depression, they have a young child, and he's unhappy and wants to leave but hasn't yet. The author is dating him, knows about the wife's issues, and is urging him to leave but not pushing too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Adultery is generally considered morally wrong in many cultures and religions. The fact that the man is still married means he's in a committed relationship, and being involved with someone else while married is cheating. The woman is aware that he's married but is still in a relationship with him. Even if the husband is unhappy and considering leaving, the act of being in a secret relationship while married is a breach of his marriage vows. \n\nNext, the woman's perspective: she says she's told him she wants him to leave soon but doesn't push him. She's understanding of his situation. But regardless of her intentions, participating in an affair is still unethical. The husband's situation doesn't excuse the affair. He's the one who's unfaithful, but the woman is also complicit by continuing the relationship while he's married.\n\nAlso, the husband's responsibility to his wife and child is important. Even if the marriage is problematic, he's still married and has obligations. The woman might be enabling him to avoid his responsibilities by staying in the affair instead of taking action.\n\nAnother angle: the woman is in a workplace relationship, which adds another layer of complexity. Office romances can lead to conflicts of interest, especially if they're secret. However, the main issue here is the marital status of the man.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is in the wrong because she's in a relationship with an unmarried man (though he's married) and participating in an affair. The fact that the husband is planning to leave doesn't justify the affair. The author is complicit in the marital infidelity.\n"
