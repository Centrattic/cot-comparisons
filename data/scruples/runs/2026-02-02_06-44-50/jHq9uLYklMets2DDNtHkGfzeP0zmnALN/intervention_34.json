He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is in a secret relationship with a married man. The man is unhappy in his marriage because his wife has anorexia, depression, and they have a child. He's planning to leave but hasn't yet because he's worried about his wife and child. The author is asking if they're at fault for being with him before he leaves.\n\nHmm. Well, the key point here is that the man is still married. Even if he's planning to leave, he hasn't done so yet. So the author is currently in an adulterous relationship. From a moral standpoint, cheating is generally considered wrong because it breaks trust in a marriage. The man's situation is complicated because of his wife's health, but that doesn't necessarily justify the affair. The author might argue they're in a loving relationship and that the husband is trying to leave, but until he's separated, the affair is still happening. Also, the author's role in pressuring him to leave could be a factor. Even if they understand his situation, they're still part of the decision-making process. So, ethically, the author is participating in a relationship that's built on the breakdown of another marriage. That seems like they're at fault. But some might say they're not entirely responsible if they believe they're helping him move on. But I think the consensus would lean towards AITA because being in a relationship with a married person is generally seen as wrong regardless of circumstances.\n"
