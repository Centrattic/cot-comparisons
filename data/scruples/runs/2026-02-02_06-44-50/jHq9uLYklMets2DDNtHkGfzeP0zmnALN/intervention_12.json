He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who started a secret relationship with a married man is in the wrong. The man is planning to leave his wife, who has anorexia, depression, and they have a child. He's struggling with staying because he's worried about her and the child but is unhappy.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the existing marriage. The man is still legally married, so any relationship outside of that is an affair. Even if the marriage is unhappy or problematic, the act of being in a relationship with someone else while married is generally considered unethical and potentially illegal in some places. The woman in the question is aware that the man is married and is in a secret relationship with him, which makes her complicit in the infidelity.\n\nThe man's situation is complicated because of his wife's health issues and their child. However, the woman in the scenario is choosing to be with him before he divorces his wife. Even if he plans to leave, the fact that he hasn't done so yet means the marriage is still valid. She's engaging in a relationship that undermines the existing marriage, which is a betrayal to the wife and child.\n\nThe wife's health issues add a layer of complexity, but they don't absolve the man or the other woman of wrongdoing. The woman in the question is taking advantage of a vulnerable situation, even if she understands his challenges. Her actions contribute to the man's potential decision to leave, but that doesn't justify her involvement. The key point is the ongoing marital status; until a divorce is finalized, the affair is not acceptable.\n\nSo, the answer would be A because the author is in a relationship with someone who is still married, regardless of the circumstances. The ethical stance here is that the marriage must be legally ended before a new relationship is appropriate.\n"
