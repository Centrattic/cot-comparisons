He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who started a relationship with a married man is in the wrong, even though the man claims he's going to leave his wife soon. The man's wife has anorexia and other issues, and he's unhappy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Adultery is generally frowned upon in many cultures and religions, so there's a moral aspect here. The key point is whether the married man has actually left his wife yet. The author is in a secret relationship, which adds to the complexity.\n\nThe man's situation is difficult, dealing with a spouse with an eating disorder and depression. But even if he's unhappy and trying to leave, as long as he's still married, entering into a new relationship could be seen as infidelity. The author's argument is that they're helping him by providing a relationship he's seeking, but that doesn't necessarily absolve them of wrongdoing in the eyes of many people.\n\nAlso, the author knows he hasn't left yet. Some might argue that as long as he's still married, any relationship is inappropriate, regardless of the circumstances. Others might say that if the man is actively planning to leave and the author is supportive, it's a different situation, but the act of being with someone while still legally married is still considered wrong by many standards.\n\nI should also consider that the author might feel they're in a good situation, but societal norms and personal ethics play a big role here. The answer hinges on whether infidelity is judged strictly based on the state of being married versus the intention to leave. Since the man hasn't left yet, the author is still in an adulterous relationship, which would make them at fault in the eyes of many people.\n"
