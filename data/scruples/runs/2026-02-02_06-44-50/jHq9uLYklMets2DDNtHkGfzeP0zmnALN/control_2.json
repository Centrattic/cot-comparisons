He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for being with a married man who hasn't left his wife yet. The situation is that the man is married to someone with anorexia, depression, and they have a young child. He's unhappy and planning to leave, but hasn't yet. The woman in the post is involved with him and is waiting for him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Cheating is generally frowned upon, regardless of the circumstances. The married man is in a committed relationship, and he's already committed to another person. The woman in the post is engaging in a relationship that's not only extramarital but also secretive. That secrecy might indicate that she's aware it's wrong or that they both don't want to face the consequences.\n\nThe man's situation is complicated by his wife's health issues and their child. But even so, he's still married. The woman might think she's not at fault because he's planning to leave, but until he actually does, he's still in a marriage. The fact that he's not leaving yet could mean he's using her as a way to cope with his current unhappy situation without taking responsibility for ending his marriage properly. \n\nThe woman says she's not rushing him, but she's still in the relationship. She might rationalize her actions by thinking he's planning to leave, but morally, being in an affair is generally considered wrong. The question is whether she's the asshole here. In many cases, people in these situations are seen as equally at fault, but since the post is from her perspective, the focus is on her.\n\nAlso, the fact that the wife has anorexia and depression adds another layer. The husband's decision to stay might be influenced by his desire to care for his wife and child, but that doesn't justify the affair. The woman in the affair is still complicit in a situation where someone is married.\n\nAnother angle is the woman's own feelings and actions. If she's aware of the complexity and still chooses to be in a relationship with him, she's making a choice that affects all parties involved. Even if she's supportive of his decision to leave, the affair is happening before the divorce, which is typically considered unethical.\n\nSo, considering these points, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong. She's involved in an affair with a man who is still married, and while his reasons for staying are complex, her participation in the affair is morally questionable. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
