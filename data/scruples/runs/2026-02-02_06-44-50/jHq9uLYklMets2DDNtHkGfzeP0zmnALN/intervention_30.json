He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for being involved with a married man who hasn't left his anorexic wife yet. The man says he'll leave her soon, and the author isn't pushing him to do it immediately.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The man is married, so the relationship is adulterous right off the bat. The wife has anorexia and depression, which complicates the situation. He's unhappy and trying to figure out when to leave her. The author is aware of the situation and is choosing to be with him despite knowing he's not yet divorced.\n\nNow, the ethical angle here. Cheating is generally considered wrong because it breaches the commitment of marriage. Even if the marriage is unhappy or problematic, the act of being unfaithful still violates the marital vows. The author is participating in a relationship that's built on deceit and betrayal. \n\nSome might argue that the man is in a tough spot because of his wife's health and their child. But the author's role here is still problematic. They're choosing to be with someone who's not free to be in a committed relationship. The man's intentions to leave are his responsibility, but the author is still complicit in the infidelity.\n\nAnother angle: the author isn't pressuring him to leave immediately, which shows they understand the complexity. However, that doesn't absolve them of wrongdoing. Being part of a secret relationship with a married person is inherently unethical, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nAlso, the author's own needs and desires here are important, but they're not valid reasons to justify cheating. Relationships need mutual consent and honesty, which aren't present here.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is in a situation where they're engaging in an affair with someone who is still married. The fact that the husband plans to leave soon doesn't change the current unethical nature of the relationship. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
