Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The main issue is about the gym having a women-only section and the author not wanting to switch gyms because of that. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend suggested switching to her gym. The author is okay with going to the same gym but objects because of the women-only section. The gym charges the same fee, but women can access more equipment in their section. The author argues that it's sexist because men are paying the same but can't use the same space. The girlfriend says it's different for women, and the author is being stupid.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's think about the reasoning here. The key point is the women-only section. In many societies, women-only spaces are established to address historical discrimination and provide a safe environment where women can feel comfortable, especially in male-dominated settings like gyms. The gym's policy might be intended to empower women or ensure they have a space without harassment.\n\nThe author's argument is that it's unfair because men pay the same fee but can't use the same equipment. However, the women-only section is a separate area, and the gym still provides other equipment for men. The author is comparing the total equipment access, but maybe the gym isn't violating any principles of equality. The women-only section is a form of affirmative action, similar to other women-only initiatives in various industries. \n\nThe girlfriend's response that it's \"different for women\" might be rooted in understanding the historical context of gender inequality in such spaces. The author might not see the need for these sections, but that doesn't necessarily make them wrong in a moral sense. The problem here is a difference in perspective rather than an actual wrongdoing. The author is not being sexist by pointing out the disparity, but they might not grasp the rationale behind the women-only section.\n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting to go to a gym with such a policy? If the gym is legally compliant and the policy is meant to address past injustices, then the author's refusal might be seen as not considering the broader social context. However, if the author is genuinely uncomfortable with the policy on principle, that's a valid personal choice, but they might be missing the point of why the gym has that section. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether the policy is seen as necessary for equality. If the author is not recognizing the intent behind the women-only section, they might be the one not understanding. But the question is whether they are in the wrong for refusing to switch gyms. The author's stance is based on equality of access, but the gym's policy is about creating equitable conditions in a different way. Therefore, the author's reasoning might be flawed, making them the asshole for not considering the purpose of the women-only section.\n"
