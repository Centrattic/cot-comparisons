Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not wanting to go to the same gym as his girlfriend because of the women-only section. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend suggested the author switch to her gym to carpool and work out together. The gym has a women-only section that takes up a quarter of the space and equipment. The author objects because he feels it's unfair to be charged the same fee but only allowed to use 75% of the equipment. The girlfriend dismissed his concerns, saying he's being stupid and that it's different for women.\n\nNow, the key issue here is the author's objection to the women-only section. He's comparing it to a hypothetical where women are excluded from part of the gym, which his girlfriend finds offensive. He argues that equality means access to all areas when paying the same price. The girlfriend, on the other hand, seems to think that the women-only section isn't a problem for her, even though it would be if the roles were reversed.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the gym is charging the same fee for everyone but restricting access to part of the facility based on gender. The author is pointing out what he sees as an inconsistency or unfairness. From a fairness standpoint, if the gym allows a women-only section, it's a form of segregation, which can be seen as discriminatory in reverse. However, some gyms offer women-only sections to create a safe space, which can be important for women who feel uncomfortable in co-ed environments. \n\nBut the argument here is about access. The author is paying for the full gym access but being excluded from part of it, similar to how women would be if they were excluded from a men-only section. The girlfriend's dismissal of this comparison might indicate she doesn't see the parallel. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author is standing by his principles. If the gym's policy is to have segregated spaces, then the author's objection is valid because it's about equal access for all members. The girlfriend's resistance might stem from not understanding his perspective or feeling that her needs (safe space) are more important. \n\nHowever, the author is also trying to find a compromise (carpooling, working out together), but the gym's policy complicates that. It's a conflict between two valid viewpoints: the author's stance on equal access and the girlfriend's need for a women-only space. \n\nSo, is he the asshole? It depends on whether the gym's policy is considered discriminatory. If the gym is allowed to have women-only sections, then the author's objection might be seen as missing the point. But if the policy restricts access for men in a way that's unequal, then the author's stance is reasonable. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's pointing out a potential inequality. The gym's policy, while well-intentioned, does create a disparity in access if not addressed.\n"
