Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author's main issue is that their girlfriend suggested they both go to the same gym, but the author is uncomfortable because the gym has a \"women only\" section. The author argues that since both pay the same fee, but the women's section restricts access to part of the equipment, it's sexist. The girlfriend got upset when the author compared it to her situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of gender-segregated spaces. Some places have women-only areas for reasons like safety, comfort, or addressing specific needs. For example, some gyms might have women-only hours to create a more welcoming environment where women feel more comfortable. The author is objecting to the gym's policy, not the existence of such spaces per se, but the fact that it's a financial issue\u2014paying the same but getting less access. \n\nThe author compares their situation to how the girlfriend would feel if she faced the opposite. The girlfriend responds that it's different for women. That part is a bit tricky. The author's analogy might not hold because the situations aren't symmetrical. Women have historically faced more systemic barriers and biases, so a women-only space might serve a different purpose than a men-only one would for women. \n\nThe author's argument is about equality of access and payment. They see it as unfair that they would pay the same but have less access. However, if the gym allows people to use the non-segregated areas, then the men aren't entirely restricted. The women-only section is a quarter of the gym, so the men could still use the other three-quarters. The author might be overreacting by framing it as not being able to use the equipment, when they can still use most of it. \n\nAdditionally, the author is making an assumption about their girlfriend's experience by comparing it to his own. The girlfriend might feel that the women-only section is beneficial for her, providing a safe space, while the author is not seeing that perspective. The author's question about whether she would accept a similar policy for men might not account for the different societal contexts that women face, which could make the segregated space necessary for them.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's point about equality is valid in a sense. If the gym charges the same but restricts access based on gender, it could be seen as discriminatory. But in practice, if the segregated section is optional and doesn't prevent men from using the rest, maybe it's not as restrictive as the author thinks. The key here is whether the gym's policy is discriminatory. If both genders have access to the majority of the facilities, then the author's objection might be more about principle than actual restriction.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the gym's policy isn't preventing men from using most of the equipment, the author's argument is a bit exaggerated. They might not be in the wrong for expressing their discomfort, but their framing of the issue as the girlfriend being sexist could be where they're missing the point. The girlfriend's response about it being \"different for women\" might be a legitimate perspective based on her experiences, which the author isn't considering. The author is approaching it from a symmetrical viewpoint that doesn't account for historical and social contexts. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not understanding the rationale behind the gym's policy and not respecting their girlfriend's perspective.\n"
