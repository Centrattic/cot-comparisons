Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to join their girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. The main issue is that the gym charges the same fee for everyone but restricts some equipment based on gender. The author argues that this is unfair because men can't use part of the gym, while the girlfriend thinks it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of single-gender spaces in gyms. Many gyms have women-only sections, often to create a safer or more comfortable environment for women. The author is comparing it to a hypothetical where women were restricted similarly, but the girlfriend responds that it's different. The key here is whether the author's objection is valid under the same-sex principle.\n\nThe author's argument is about equal access and not paying for the full gym if part is restricted. If the gym allows men to use the entire facility except the women-only section, then men effectively have access to 75% of the equipment. But women can use 100% of the gym, including their own section. So from an access standpoint, the author is right that there's an inequality in what each gender can use for the same price. However, the existence of women-only sections might be seen as addressing different needs, like safety or comfort, which are legitimate concerns but aren't the same as equal access.\n\nBut the author is applying the same standard here, expecting both genders to have equal access. If the gym allows men to use all equipment except the women-only area, then men are indeed paying for access they don't get. The girlfriend's response that \"it's different for women\" might stem from the idea that women face unique challenges in mixed-gender spaces, hence the need for their own section. However, the author's stance is about fairness in access based on price.\n\nIs the author being sexist by not wanting to support a gym with a women-only section? Or is the gym's policy discriminatory against men? It's a tricky balance. The author isn't opposing the women-only section per se but is upset about the unequal access when considering the fee. If the gym were to allow women to use all areas and men only part, that would be unequal. But since the gym allows men to use the whole gym except the women-only part, men have access to 75% of the equipment, while women can use 100%. So the author's point about paying the same but getting less access is valid.\n\nHowever, the existence of the women-only section might be a response to women's preferences or societal issues, not an attempt to discriminate. The author's refusal to join the gym could be seen as not recognizing the purpose of such sections. But the author isn't saying the women-only section is bad; they're just objecting to the unequal access. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction that the author is being \"stupid\" and her dismissal of the hypothetical scenario where she's restricted might indicate she's not seeing the parallel. The author is applying the same logic to both genders, which is a fair approach to equality. If the gym's policy is that women can use all areas and men can't, that's a problem. But here, the policy is that men can use the main gym plus the non-women-only sections, while women can use all. So the author's point about unequal access for the same price stands. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're pointing out a discrepancy in access based on gender for the same fee. The girlfriend might be overlooking the logical inconsistency in the gym's policy. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
