Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because his girlfriend's gym has a women-only section. The key points are that the gym has a section that's only for women, which makes up a quarter of the gym and the equipment. The author is upset because he'd pay the same fee but only have access to 75% of the space and equipment. His girlfriend thinks he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical angles. In many places, it's illegal to discriminate based on sex, but there are exceptions for \"separate but equal\" facilities if they're designed to address specific needs. For example, women-only gyms or sections might exist to provide a space where women feel more comfortable, which can address issues like harassment or lack of confidence in mixed environments. So, if the gym is charging the same fee but offering a women-only section, but that's not illegal if it's part of accommodating women's needs, then maybe the author's argument is missing that point.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's paying the same but getting less access. But if the gym is structured so that men can use the entire gym (the 75% plus the women-only 25% when not occupied by women?), or if the women-only section is part of the same membership but not exclusive to them? Wait, the user says the women-only section is 1/4 of the area and equipment. So if the author is not allowed into that section, then he's restricted in the same way women are restricted from the rest. But maybe men can use the entire gym, including the women-only section when it's not in use? Or is the women-only section completely separate and off-limits to men at all times?\n\nIf the women-only section is only for women and the rest is co-ed, then the author's argument is that he's paying the same but can't use the women's section. But if the gym is designed so that women have their own space, which is a common practice to address gender disparities in access to fitness facilities, then maybe the author is misunderstanding the purpose. The gym might be providing a specific service that's intended to benefit women, and the author's complaint is about not having equal access to all parts, which might not be the case if the gym is structured for co-ed areas plus a women-only section.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's response that it's \"different for women\" might refer to the historical and ongoing issues where women have less access to certain spaces, so creating women-only areas is a way to correct that imbalance. The author's analogy of asking his girlfriend if she'd go to a gym that barred her from a large portion of equipment might be a false equivalence because the situation is different\u2014there's a long history of exclusion of women from certain spaces, and women-only sections are a response to that, not an arbitrary segregation.\n\nSo, from an ethical standpoint, the author is not in the wrong if he's against gender-based restrictions, but the girlfriend's gym might have a legitimate reason for the women-only section. The author could be misunderstanding the intent behind the women-only area. The gym's policy might be considered equitable in the context of addressing past inequities. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily wrong, but he might not be considering the broader context of why such sections exist. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
