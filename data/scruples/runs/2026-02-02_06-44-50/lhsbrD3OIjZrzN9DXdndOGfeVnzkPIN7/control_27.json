Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to switch to their girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section.\n\nFirst, the key point here is the presence of a women-only section. The gym charges the same fee for everyone, but the woman-only area restricts men from using part of the equipment and space. The author argues that this is sexist because it's like paying full price but having limited access based on gender. Their girlfriend seems to think it's different for women, maybe because women-only spaces are meant to address historical underrepresentation or create a safer environment.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author's argument is about equality and fairness\u2014if everyone is charged the same, shouldn't everyone have equal access? They see the restriction as discriminatory. On the other hand, the girlfriend might believe that the women's section is a necessary concession to provide women with a safe space in a traditionally male-dominated environment. Maybe she doesn't see it as sexist because it's intended to empower women, not limit men.\n\nBut the core issue is whether the gym's policy is inherently sexist. If the gym is charging equal fees but restricting access based on gender, that could be seen as discriminatory against men. However, women-only spaces are often justified as a way to address systemic issues and create inclusive environments. The problem arises if the gym is not providing equivalent access in return for the fee. If the author is being excluded from 25% of the gym's resources solely based on their gender, that could be considered unequal treatment, regardless of the gym's intentions.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests she finds the author's comparison offensive, which might stem from her belief that the women's section is a positive space. However, the author's logic is that if you pay the same fee, you should have the same access. The gym's policy seems to violate that principle. Unless the gym is offering additional benefits to women that compensate for the restrictions (like specialized classes or facilities), the policy could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nIn terms of the relationship, the author's stance is about personal principle, while the girlfriend's stance might be about her comfort and the gym's role in her life. The question is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing their principles over their partner's wishes. If the issue is about fairness and equality, the author isn't necessarily wrong. However, if the argument is about not respecting their partner's needs or the significance of the women-only space, then there might be a relational issue. But the core of the question is about the gym's policy, not the relationship dynamics.\n\nSo, based on the principle of equal access for equal fees, the author's position seems valid. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
