Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to go to his girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. The gym charges the same for everyone, but the women-only part is a quarter of the equipment. The author thinks it's sexist to pay full price for less access. The girlfriend thinks it's different for women. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of single-sex spaces. Historically, women-only gyms or sections might have existed as safe spaces, especially in areas where women felt uncomfortable or unwelcome. So maybe the intention behind the women-only section is to provide a supportive environment, free from judgment or harassment. But the author is being charged the same but can't access that section, which he sees as unfair.\n\nThe key points here are equality and fairness. The author is arguing that charging the same fee while restricting access based on gender is discriminatory. But from the girlfriend's perspective, the women-only section serves a purpose different from the co-ed areas. However, if the gym is charging everyone the same regardless of access, that could be a problem. If the men can't access the women-only section, but women can access all areas, then maybe there's a double standard.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the women-only section is a quarter of the gym. So men can use the rest. But women can use all the equipment, including the co-ed and women-only areas. So women have access to 100% of the gym, men only 75% if they go there. That seems like a disparity. If the gym allows women to use all sections but men can't access a section, then it's not equal. The author is pointing out that he's being charged the same but has less access, which is a valid point of discrimination. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's argument is that it's different for women. Maybe she believes that the women-only section is a necessary accommodation, providing a space where women can work out without men, which might be important for their comfort and safety. But if the gym's policy is that men can't access that section while women can access all sections, then it's a one-way benefit. The author's refusal to go there isn't about denying women the right but about seeking equal access. \n\nIn terms of legal standards, in many places, single-sex facilities are allowed under certain conditions, but discrimination in access based on gender when charging the same rates might be an issue. Especially if the gym is providing different benefits to different genders without a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason. \n\nSo, the author is not wrong for pointing out the inequality in access. The girlfriend's position might stem from a different perspective, perhaps thinking that the women-only section is a positive feature for women, but if the gym is effectively limiting men's access without justification, that's a problem. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
