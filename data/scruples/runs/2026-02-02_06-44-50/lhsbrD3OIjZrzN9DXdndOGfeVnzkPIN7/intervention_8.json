Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style question is in the wrong for not wanting to switch to his girlfriend's gym because of the women-only section.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his girlfriend go to different gyms. She wants him to switch to her gym for convenience, like carpooling and working out together. The issue is that her gym has a women-only section that takes up a quarter of the gym and equipment. The author objects because it feels sexist, arguing that men pay the same fee but can't use that section. When he questions her, she gets upset and says it's different for women.\n\nSo, the core conflict is about whether the women-only section is justified and if the author's objection is valid. The author is using a parallel argument: if women were excluded from part of the gym, it would be bad. The girlfriend reacts negatively, implying that the two situations aren't the same.\n\nI need to consider the context of the women-only section. In many places, such sections exist to provide a safe space for women, especially in areas where they might feel uncomfortable or unsafe. It's a response to societal issues where women are targeted or harassed in public spaces. So, the gym might have this section to create a more inclusive environment, even if it seems unequal on the surface.\n\nThe author's argument is about fairness: paying full price for less access. But the counterargument is that the women-only section serves a purpose beyond just equipment access. It's about safety and comfort, which is a different justification than what the author is considering.\n\nIs the author wrong for not seeing this distinction? He's trying to apply the same standard to both genders, which might be valid in terms of equality, but the existence of the women-only section is addressing a specific need. The author's analogy of flipping the genders might not hold because the underlying reasons for the section are different. For example, men don't face the same societal risks in public gyms that women do, so creating a space for them isn't necessary in the same way.\n\nHowever, the author's perspective is about equal treatment. If the gym allows one gender to have exclusive access to part of the facility, even if it's for a good reason, is that inherently sexist? Or is it a necessary accommodation? This is tricky. The question is whether the author's objection is based on a misunderstanding of the rationale behind the women-only section.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests she feels the author isn't getting why the section exists. If the author can't see that the reasons for the women-only area are different from, say, a men-only section, then he might be in the wrong for not understanding her perspective. But if the author believes that such a policy is inherently discriminatory regardless of intent, that's a different stance.\n\nIn legal terms, in some jurisdictions, such gender-segregated spaces can be permissible under certain conditions, especially if they serve a legitimate purpose like safety. However, in other contexts, it might be seen as discriminatory. The key is whether the gym is providing equal value for the fee. Since the author is paying the same fee but can't access all areas, that could be a point. But if the gym's policy is to offer a specific service to women (the women-only section) as part of their offerings, then perhaps the author's argument is missing the point.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he's not considering the intent behind the women-only section and is applying a strict equality standard without understanding the context. His analogy might not be fair because the situations aren't symmetrical. The girlfriend is justified in feeling he doesn't understand her position, so the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
