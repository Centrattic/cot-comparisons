Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because of the women-only section. The author's main issue is that the gym charges everyone the same fee but restricts access based on gender, which they find sexist. Their girlfriend thinks they're being stupid and says it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of gender equality here. If the gym allows a section exclusively for women, but charges men the same price without giving them access to that part, that seems unequal. The author is pointing out that if the roles were reversed, he wouldn't want to pay full price for limited access. That's a valid point. The girlfriend's response that \"it's different for women\" might be a form of justifying gender-based discrimination, which could be problematic.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the women-only section's purpose. Maybe it's meant to create a safe space for women, which is a common argument in favor of such policies. The author is not against the women-only section itself but against the unequal access for men who pay the same. The key issue here is whether denying access to part of the facility based on gender is discriminatory. \n\nIf the gym doesn't offer a male-only section or equivalent, then charging men the same fee while restricting their access could be seen as sexist. The author is applying the same standard they'd expect for themselves. The girlfriend's refusal to see it that way might stem from a different perspective on gender roles or equality. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for having this stance? If the gym's policy is inherently discriminatory, then the author is standing up against unfair treatment. On the other hand, if the women-only section is a legitimate offering that doesn't disadvantage men in the same way, maybe the author is overreacting. However, the gym charges the same price regardless, so denying access to a quarter of the equipment and space is a tangible disadvantage. The author isn't against the women-only section per se but against unequal access for men. That seems fair. The girlfriend's upset reaction might indicate a lack of empathy towards their partner's perspective. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out what they see as an inconsistency in the gym's policies. Standing up for gender equality in this context is reasonable. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
