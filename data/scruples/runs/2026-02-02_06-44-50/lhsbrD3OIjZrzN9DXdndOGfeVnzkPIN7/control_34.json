Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because of the \"women only\" section. The key points here are about fairness and sexism.\n\nThe author's girlfriend suggested they both go to her gym for convenience. The issue is that the gym has a section exclusively for women, which the author feels is unfair because men pay the same fee but can't use that part. The author argues that it's like charging full price for limited access, which seems like a valid point about equality.\n\nThe girlfriend's response is that it's different for women, which might imply that she sees the women-only section as necessary or beneficial for women's comfort or safety. But the author is confused why that would justify unequal treatment when it's the same price. \n\nNow, from a fairness perspective, if the gym allows a section based on gender but charges the same, that could be seen as discriminatory against men. Men are paying for access they don't get, which is a form of unequal treatment. The author is pointing out that inconsistency. \n\nHowever, the other side is that the women-only section might exist to address women's needs, such as a safer space. But if the gym is charging the same for men, then men aren't getting the full value of their membership, which is a separate issue. \n\nThe author isn't against the women-only section per se, but rather the fact that men are still charged the same price without any compensation. The girlfriend's refusal to see this as an issue might be a failure to consider the author's perspective. \n\nSo, the author isn't being sexist; they're highlighting a potential unfairness in the pricing model. The girlfriend's dismissal as \"stupid\" is problematic. The author's analogy about being forbidden from using equipment is valid because it's about access versus cost. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
