Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend wants them to go to the same gym, but the guy is objecting because the gym has a women-only section. He argues that it's sexist because men can't use that part, even though they pay the same. The girlfriend thinks he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue. The guy is uncomfortable with the gender segregation in the gym. The gym has a women-only area, which is a common feature in some places to create a safe space for women. But the guy sees this as unequal treatment since men can't use that area, even though they pay the same fee. The girlfriend's response is that it's different for women, implying she doesn't see the issue.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Is gender segregation in this context inherently sexist? Or is it a way to accommodate different needs? In many societies, women-only spaces are created to address historical imbalances and provide a safe environment where women can exercise without feeling uncomfortable or unsafe. The gym allows men to use the rest of the facility, so they aren't excluded entirely. However, the guy is being excluded from a part of the gym that women can access. \n\nThe argument here is about equality. The guy is pointing out that for the same price, different access is given based on gender, which could be seen as discriminatory. But the counterargument is that the women-only section exists for valid reasons, and men aren't being excluded from the entire gym, just a part of it. The girlfriend might see this as her right to have a space where she can workout without harassment or discomfort, which is a common issue women face in co-ed gyms.\n\nIs the author being hypocritical? If the author were in the women-only section, he wouldn't be allowed, but if women were in a men-only section, they couldn't access that either. However, the existence of such spaces is often justified as addressing the underrepresentation and safety concerns of women in fitness environments. The author's stance is that excluding men from that area is unfair. \n\nBut does the author have a valid point? If the principle is equality, then having a women-only section while charging men the same might seem unequal. However, if the justification for the women-only section is to promote inclusivity and safety for women, then it's a different perspective. The author is not against the concept of women-only spaces but is objecting to the fact that men can't use them, which might be a matter of differing values.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the gym's policy is to provide a safe space for women, then the author's objection could be seen as not understanding the necessity of such spaces. On the other hand, if the author's point is that the policy creates an imbalance (men can't access a part of the facility women can), then he's raising a valid concern about equality.\n\nHowever, the context is crucial here. In many places, women-only gyms or sections are common and are seen as a positive step towards encouraging women to participate in fitness without feeling judged or harassed. The author's analogy about women being excluded from a men-only section might not hold because the societal context for women's needs is different. The author is applying a principle of equal access, while the girlfriend is emphasizing the importance of women's spaces.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but he might not fully grasp the rationale behind women-only spaces. The issue is complex and involves balancing equality with the need for inclusive spaces. The answer could be B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's voicing a valid concern about unequal access, even if he's not considering the underlying reasons for the women-only section. However, depending on the cultural context, the perspective might differ. But based on the information given, the author's stance is about fairness, which is a legitimate viewpoint.\n"
