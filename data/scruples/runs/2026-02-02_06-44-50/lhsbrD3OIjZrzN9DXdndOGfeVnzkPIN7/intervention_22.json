Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author's girlfriend suggesting they both go to the same gym to carpool and work out together. The problem is that the girlfriend's gym has a \"women only\" section. The author is uncomfortable with this because it seems like a gender-based restriction.\n\nThe author argues that since the gym charges everyone the same fee, it's unfair that men can't use a quarter of the equipment. The girlfriend responds that it's different for women. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) here.\n\nHmm. So, first, the gym does have a women-only section. But the rest of the gym is co-ed, I assume. The question is whether it's sexist for the gym to have that section. But is it actually discriminatory? Maybe not necessarily. The women-only section could be for their comfort and safety, which is a common reason gyms have such areas. However, the author's point is that men are paying the same but can't use that part. That seems like unequal access based on gender, which could be seen as discriminatory against men. \n\nBut then, the author is comparing it to if women were excluded from part of the gym. The girlfriend says that's different, which might be because historically, women have faced more discrimination, so creating safe spaces for them is a way to address past inequalities. The author might not be considering the historical context and the reasons behind such sections.\n\nSo, the author is pointing out a potential inconsistency: if the gym allows a women-only area, why not a similar area for men? But the girlfriend argues it's different. The key here is whether the author's objection is valid or if it's dismissing the legitimate reasons for the women-only section. The author's argument is about equal access, but the existence of the women-only section isn't inherently sexist if it's meant to provide a safe space. The author might not realize that the gym isn't excluding men entirely; they can still use three-quarters of the gym. However, the author's issue is the principle of being charged equally but not having full access. \n\nBut maybe the author is missing the nuance here. The women-only section is about empowerment and safety, not about excluding men. The fact that men can't use that part is a form of positive discrimination to help women who might feel uncomfortable in a mixed environment. So the author's comparison isn't fair because the context for women is different. Therefore, the author's stance might not be understanding the reasons behind the women-only section, making them the asshole here. \n\nAlternatively, if the gym is charging the same fee without providing equal access, that's a problem. But maybe the women-only section is just a part of the facility, and the rest is accessible. The author could be overreacting to something that's intended to be inclusive for women. So, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong because the gym's policy could be seen as discriminatory against men. But I'm not sure. Another angle is that the author is not seeing the purpose of the women-only section and is making a false equivalence by suggesting that it's the same as if women were excluded. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's reasoning might be flawed because they're not considering the historical and social reasons for the women-only section. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not understanding that the gym's policy isn't about excluding men but about providing a safe space for women. So the answer would be A (author is in the wrong). However, there's a counterpoint that the gym should provide equal access, but maybe the women-only section is a separate part. This is a bit tricky. I think the key is that the author is making a comparison that doesn't account for the different contexts, so they're not understanding the purpose of the women-only area. Therefore, A.\n"
