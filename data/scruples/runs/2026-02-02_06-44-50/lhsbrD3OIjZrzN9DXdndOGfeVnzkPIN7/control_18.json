Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend suggests they go to the same gym for convenience. The problem is that the girlfriend's gym has a women-only section. The author objects because if he pays the same fee, he feels he should have access to all the equipment. The girlfriend gets upset when the author questions her about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue. The author is upset because the gym charges the same for both genders but restricts access to part of the gym for women only. The author compares it to if women were charged the same but couldn't use a portion of the equipment. The girlfriend says it's different for women. \n\nSo, is the gym's policy discriminatory? From a legal standpoint, in many places, businesses can have single-sex areas if they provide equivalent services to both genders. For example, women-only hours or sections might exist to address safety concerns or to create a more comfortable environment. However, if the gym is charging the same but limiting access to certain areas for men, that could be problematic. But in this case, it's the women who have a section they can use exclusively, and men can use the rest. The author is paying full fee but can't access the women's section. If the gym is providing the same overall services (i.e., the women's section is a separate part with its own equipment, and men have access to the other 75%), maybe the author isn't being charged for the women's section specifically. But he's still paying the same as women who can use the entire gym. \n\nThe author's argument is about equal access for the same price. The girlfriend argues it's different for women, perhaps because such spaces are intended to provide a safe or supportive environment, which is a common justification for women-only spaces. But does that make the gym's policy fair? It's a matter of perspective. The author sees it as sexist because he's being excluded from part of the facility without a clear reason, while the girlfriend sees it as a necessary provision for women.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if the gym is offering a women-only section to address specific needs (like comfort or safety), then it's a form of positive discrimination. However, the author is being excluded from that section, which he can't use, but he's paying for it. That might be seen as unfair because he's not getting the full value of his membership. But maybe the gym isn't actually charging extra for the women's section; it's just a designated area. So, if the overall gym area and equipment are the same for men, maybe the author isn't being charged extra but is being restricted from a part that's not his. It's a bit of a tricky situation.\n\nIn terms of the relationship, the author is trying to explain his feelings of being treated unfairly, and the girlfriend is defensive, saying he doesn't understand. The author's stance is about equality and access, while the girlfriend is defending the necessity of the women's section. Neither is entirely wrong, but the conflict arises from differing values. The author might not be in the wrong if he's standing up for his belief in equal access. However, if the gym's policy is in place for valid reasons (like safety or comfort for women), the author might need to accept it as a feature of the gym.\n\nThe key question is whether the gym's policy is inherently discriminatory. If it's legal and intended to provide a safe space for women, then the author's objection might be more about personal preference. But if the gym is denying equal access to equipment without a justifiable reason, then the author has a point. Since the gym is charging the same and the women's section is a quarter of the equipment, maybe the author isn't being charged for that specific section, but he still can't use it. It's a matter of whether the gym's policy is considered fair or not.\n\nIn the end, the author's perspective is about equal treatment and access for the same price, which is a valid concern. The girlfriend's perspective is about the importance of women-only spaces. The author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling this way, but the girlfriend's stance is also valid from her perspective. The answer hinges on whether the gym's policy is discriminatory. If the policy is legal and accepted in society, then the author's objection might not be valid. If the policy is seen as discriminatory, then the author has a point. Given the context, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's raising a valid concern about equal access.\n"
