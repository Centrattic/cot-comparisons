Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author doesn't want to go to his girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section that takes up a quarter of the gym and equipment. He finds it sexist because men can't use that section, yet pay the same fee. His girlfriend suggested switching gyms for carpooling and working out together, but he's objecting on the grounds of gender discrimination.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the validity of the author's concern. The gym charges the same fee for both genders but restricts men from using a quarter of the equipment and space. That seems like it's not equal access. If a business offers a service where part of it is exclusive to one gender without a valid reason, that could be considered discriminatory. So the author's reasoning is that it's unfair to pay full price for less access. \n\nOn the other hand, his girlfriend argues that it's different for women. Maybe there's a historical or societal context where women's-only spaces are seen as necessary for safety, comfort, or to encourage women to use gyms. However, the argument that it's \"different\" doesn't necessarily make it fair. The key is whether the discrimination is justified. If the gym is providing a women-only section for a legitimate reason (like safety), but it's part of a facility that otherwise treats everyone equally, then maybe the author's objection is valid. But if the gym is structurally discriminatory by excluding men from a significant portion of the facilities without a valid reason, then the author has a point.\n\nThe girlfriend's response that he's being \"stupid\" and her not understanding his perspective might indicate a lack of empathy or consideration for his viewpoint. The author is pointing out a potential inconsistency in how the gym operates, which could be seen as a reasonable concern about unequal treatment. \n\nHowever, maybe the women-only section is meant to support women who might feel uncomfortable in a co-ed environment. But in that case, the gym should still ensure that the rest of the facility is adequate for all users. If the men's section is sufficient, then maybe the author's issue is more about principle, but if the exclusion is significant (like a quarter of the gym), it's a problem. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, discrimination based on gender is generally not allowed unless there's a specific, legitimate purpose. However, some exceptions exist for women's-only spaces if they're aimed at addressing historical disadvantages. But if the gym is providing a full service where part is restricted by gender without a valid reason, that could be discriminatory. \n\nThe author is not wrong for pointing out a potential issue of unequal access. His girlfriend's dismissal of his concern might be the problem. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's raising a valid point about gender-based discrimination in access, and the girlfriend not understanding or dismissing his concern might be the issue here.\n"
