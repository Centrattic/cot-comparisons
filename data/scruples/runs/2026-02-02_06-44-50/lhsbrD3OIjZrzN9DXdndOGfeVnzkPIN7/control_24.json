Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting to switch to his girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section, which he finds sexist. The gym charges the same fee for everyone, but men can't use the women-only area, which is 25% of the facility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's argument is that it's unfair to pay full price but not have access to all the equipment based on gender. That seems like a valid point because paying full fee should grant access to all services. So if men can't use a quarter of the gym, that's a limitation. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might be defending the women-only section, which could be for reasons like creating a safe space for women, maybe for modesty or to avoid harassment. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is whether the author's reasoning is valid. The gym's policy is allowing a segregated area, which might be a form of gender discrimination. If the gym is charging the same fee but restricting access based on gender, that could be seen as discriminatory against men. The author is pointing out the inconsistency. \n\nThe girlfriend's response that \"it's different for women\" might imply that the women-only section is necessary, but that doesn't justify the unequal access for men. The author is trying to highlight the double standard. So, from a fairness standpoint, the author isn't wrong. However, maybe there's a cultural or social context where the women-only section is intended to be beneficial for women, so the author's refusal to switch gyms might cause conflict. \n\nBut the core issue is the policy itself. If the gym is allowing one gender to have exclusive access to part of the facility while charging everyone the same, that's a problem. The author is not wrong in pointing out the sexism in that policy. The girlfriend's reaction might be defensive because she supports the women-only space, but the author is justified in his stance. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The gym's policy is discriminatory, and the author is right to object to unequal access. The girlfriend's frustration might stem from not seeing the issue as the author does, but that doesn't make him the asshole here.\n"
