Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the AITA situation is in the wrong. Let's break this down.\n\nThe scenario is about a couple where the girlfriend suggests they both switch to her gym so they can carpool and work out together. The guy is okay with the idea except for the fact that the gym has a \"women only\" section. The gym charges the same fee for both genders, but that section is exclusively for women and uses a quarter of the equipment and space. The guy argues that it's unfair to pay the same fee but have access to less equipment based on gender. The girlfriend says he's being stupid, and when he asks if she would accept the reverse, she gets upset and says \"it's different for women.\" The guy is wondering if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the fairness of the situation. The key issue is the access to a portion of the gym based on gender. The woman-only section is a common feature in some gyms and is intended to create a space where women can work out without the presence of men, which can help them feel more comfortable. However, the guy is paying the same fee but not allowed into that section. He's arguing that this is discriminatory because he's paying full price for less access. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the gym is charging the same fee but restricting access to certain areas based on gender, it's a form of discrimination. The principle of equal treatment would suggest that if someone is paying the same, they should have access to the same resources. However, the existence of a women-only section is often justified on the basis of providing a safe or comfortable space for women, which is a separate consideration. \n\nThe guy's argument is that the gym is not providing equal value for equal price. The girlfriend's response that \"it's different for women\" might be referring to the social and cultural context where women may need such spaces for safety or comfort. However, the guy is pointing out that the same rule doesn't apply to him\u2014if the gym had a men-only section and charged him the same, he wouldn't have access to that either. \n\nIn terms of fairness in the relationship, the guy is expressing a concern about what he perceives as unequal treatment. The girlfriend, however, might feel that his refusal to use the gym is dismissing her needs and the reasons why the women-only section exists. This could be a point of conflict if the guy is unwilling to accommodate her needs for a comfortable workout environment.\n\nThe question is whether the guy is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the gym's policy is inherently discriminatory or if the women-only section justifies the same fee despite reduced access for men. Legally, in some places, gender-segregated spaces can be allowed if they serve a specific purpose, like safety. But from a fairness standpoint, the guy's argument is valid because he's paying for the full gym but not getting the same access. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's needs are also valid. If the women-only section is important for her to feel comfortable, the guy not switching gyms could be seen as not supporting her. The conflict here is between his principle of fairness and her need for a comfortable workout environment. \n\nIn such cases, the relationship aspect is crucial. If the guy is willing to switch gyms but is uncomfortable with the policy, he might choose to find a compromise. The girlfriend's reaction to his questioning the reverse scenario might be seen as dismissive, but her justification is about the different social contexts for men and women. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the gym's policy is discriminatory, then the guy isn't wrong to object. However, if the policy is considered acceptable, then his refusal to switch gyms might be seen as prioritizing his own principles over his girlfriend's needs. \n\nGiven that the question is about whether he's an asshole, the answer might hinge on societal norms and the specific reasoning. If the gym is legally allowed to have such sections, the guy might be in the wrong for not accommodating his girlfriend's preference. However, if the policy is indeed discriminatory, he's justified. \n\nBut in most legal contexts, such women-only sections are permitted as they're considered accommodations for women's needs. Therefore, the guy's objection might be seen as not understanding that the situations are different. Hence, he might be in the wrong.\n"
