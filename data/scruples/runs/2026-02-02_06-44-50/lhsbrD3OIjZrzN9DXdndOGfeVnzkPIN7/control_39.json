Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether it's fair for a gym to have a women-only section while charging the same fee to everyone. The author thinks it's sexist because men can't use that section, effectively giving them less access for the same price. The girlfriend thinks it's okay, maybe because she sees it as a positive space for women.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, businesses can have single-sex spaces if they're optional. For example, women-only sections in gyms are sometimes allowed under anti-discrimination laws as they can provide a safe environment. So the gym might not be violating any laws here.\n\nNext, the fairness argument. The author is pointing out that men pay the same but can't access part of the gym. But the women-only section isn't exclusive to all men; men can still use the other 75%. The question is whether that's discriminatory. If the gym doesn't charge extra for the women-only part, maybe it's a way to offer an additional benefit to female members, which isn't inherently unfair unless it's enforced in a way that disadvantages men without compensation.\n\nThe author's analogy about women being charged the same but denied access to part of the gym is interesting. But the difference is that the women-only section is a choice. Men aren't being excluded from their own facilities, they just can't access the women's area. So the comparison might not be directly applicable. The author is assuming that the situation would be the same if roles were reversed, but the context of providing safe spaces for women versus excluding men is different.\n\nThen there's the relationship dynamics. The author is refusing to switch gyms because of this policy, which the girlfriend sees as being unreasonable. The author's stance is about principle, while the girlfriend might value the convenience of carpooling and working out together more. It's a conflict between personal values and relationship practicality.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is the author wrong to prioritize their principles? If the policy is legal and common, maybe the author is overreacting. But if the author genuinely feels it's discriminatory, is that a valid concern? It's possible that the author's perspective is valid, but the way they're approaching the situation might be causing conflict without a clear resolution.\n\nUltimately, whether it's the author's fault depends on societal norms. If having women-only sections is culturally acceptable and legally permissible, then the author might be the one causing unnecessary tension. However, if the author's objection is based on fairness and equality, they might be justified. But since the gym isn't explicitly restricting men beyond the women-only section, the author's stance could be seen as not understanding the purpose of such spaces. So maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong), but I'm not 100% sure.\n"
