Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch to his girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. The main issue is that the gym charges the same fee for everyone but has a section where only women can use part of the equipment and space.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author's reasoning is about fairness and equal access. He's saying that if the gym charges the same fee but restricts access based on gender, it's sexist. He's drawing an analogy: if the gym had a men-only section that excluded women, he wouldn't want to go there either. His girlfriend, on the other hand, thinks it's different for women, perhaps because she sees the women-only section as a positive space, maybe for safety or to encourage women to work out without male presence.\n\nI should think about the concept of equality here. If a place charges the same but gives different access based on gender, isn't that discriminatory? The author is pointing out a double standard. However, his girlfriend might argue that the women-only section exists to address historical imbalances or to create a safe space for women, which is a different context. But does that justify unequal treatment? The key here is whether the gym is providing the same value for the same price. If the author is paying full price but can't access all areas, that's a problem. However, if the gym is allowing women to have exclusive use of certain equipment without charging them extra, maybe it's seen as a benefit to women, but a drawback for men.\n\nAnother angle is the social context. Some gyms have women-only hours or sections to encourage female participation in fitness, which can be beneficial. But from a legal standpoint, in many places, gender-based segregation in facilities can be considered discrimination unless it's for a legitimate purpose. However, the gym might argue that it's a service they offer, and customers can choose whether to use it or not. But the author is not against the women-only section per se; he's against being charged the same fee when he can't access the same facilities. That's a valid point because he's not getting the full value for money.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is important too. She called him \"stupid,\" which is a strong reaction. If she can't see the author's perspective, maybe she's not considering his valid points about equality. However, she might feel that the women-only section is a positive feature, and the author is not respecting her choice.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is advocating for equal treatment. If the gym allows women to have exclusive access to part of the facility, but men are excluded from that same part, then it's inconsistent treatment. The author is essentially saying, \"If it was men being excluded, you'd see it as unfair. So why is it okay when women are the ones being privileged?\" His girlfriend's response that it's \"different for women\" might be a form of justifying unequal treatment by gender, which could be seen as maintaining a sexist standard.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is making a logical argument based on equality and fairness. He doesn't want to be in a place where he's not receiving the same access for the same price. His girlfriend, however, might be defending a practice she sees as beneficial for women. But from a neutrality standpoint, if a facility treats different genders differently without a non-discriminatory reason, it's problematic. The gym's policy could be considered discriminatory, and the author is pointing out the inconsistency. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; he's raising a valid concern about equality.\n"
