Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because of the women-only section. The main issue is about gender-based access to resources and perceived fairness.\n\nFirst, the gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women. However, the women-only section is a quarter of the gym's area and equipment. The author argues that if a man were charged the same fee but could only use 75% of the equipment, that would be unfair. The girlfriend thinks it's different for women, possibly because of historical or cultural reasons where women might need separate spaces to feel safe or comfortable.\n\nThe author's point is about equity: paying full price for less access. But the girlfriend's response suggests that the women-only section serves a different purpose. Maybe it's intended to create a safe environment for women to work out without feeling uncomfortable or intimidated by men. So, the author's comparison might not hold because the women-only section isn't about exclusion for the sake of exclusion, but about inclusion and empowerment for women.\n\nHowever, the author's concern about fairness isn't entirely without merit. If the gym is charging the same fee but effectively limiting access for men, there's a discrepancy. But the key difference here is that the women-only section is a choice. Men aren't forced to go there, and they have access to the remaining 75% of the gym. The author is upset about not being able to access the entire facility, but the gym isn't barring men; they just have a separate area. So, the author is free to use the other 75%, which might be sufficient. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is in a space where she can work out without male presence, which might be important for her comfort. The author's refusal to switch gyms could be seen as not recognizing her needs, even if the gym setup isn't perfect. It's a balance between personal comfort and equitable access. \n\nThe author is not necessarily wrong in pointing out the inequity, but they might not fully understand the rationale behind the women-only section. The girlfriend's frustration likely stems from feeling that her needs are being dismissed. So, while the author has a valid point about fairness, the context of the women-only section being a safe space complicates things. The author might not be the asshole, but their lack of understanding of the situation could make them at least partially responsible for the conflict. However, the gym's structure isn't inherently wrong; it's about differing perspectives on what constitutes fairness. So, the answer might be B (not wrong), but with nuance.\n"
