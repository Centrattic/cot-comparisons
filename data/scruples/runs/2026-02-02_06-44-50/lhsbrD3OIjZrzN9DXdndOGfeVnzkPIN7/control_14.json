Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend suggested they both go to the same gym to carpool and work out together. The problem is that the gym has a \"women only\" section, which takes up a quarter of the space and equipment. The author objects because it's sexist\u2014he points out that men pay the same fee but can't use that section, which he feels is unfair. His girlfriend gets upset and says he's being stupid and that \"it's different for women.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue. The author is upset about the gym's policy of a women-only section. He sees it as discriminatory because men are excluded from part of the facility even though they pay the same. His girlfriend, on the other hand, might support the women-only section for reasons like creating a safe space for women to work out without male judgment or harassment. She might feel that this section is necessary for women's comfort and empowerment.\n\nThe author's argument is about equality\u2014he wants equal access for everyone. His girlfriend's stance is about inclusivity and addressing historical gender imbalances in gym environments. The question then becomes whether the author is wrong for objecting to the women-only section on the grounds of equality.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a debate around single-sex spaces. Some argue that women-only sections can help women feel more comfortable and safe, especially in environments where they might otherwise feel intimidated. Others see it as a form of segregation that's unnecessary in a supposedly equal society. The gym's policy might be intended to support women, but the author perceives it as discriminatory against men.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's objection is valid. If the gym is charging the same fee regardless of access to the women-only section, does that mean the policy is fair? The author is paying full price but getting less access, which he finds unfair. However, the women-only section might be seen as an additional benefit for women, not a subtraction from men. If men can still use the remaining 75% of the gym, perhaps the author's complaint is about missing out on the extra 25%, which might not be the same as a direct exclusion from the entire facility.\n\nBut then again, if the gym is providing a service (full access to all equipment and areas) but excluding men from part of it, that could be considered discriminatory. The author is being charged the same as women who have access to more. So, from his perspective, it's a case of unequal treatment based on sex.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's girlfriend might feel that the women-only section is necessary for women's empowerment and that the gym isn't doing anything wrong by offering it. She might not see it as taking away from men's access but as adding something for women. Her response that \"it's different for women\" could stem from a place of understanding the historical context where women might not have had such spaces.\n\nThe author's question is whether he's an asshole for not wanting to go to a gym with such a policy. The answer depends on whose rights and needs are being prioritized. If the gym is allowed to have a women-only section without violating any laws (and in many places, single-sex spaces are permitted under certain conditions), then the author's objection might be seen as a personal disagreement with the gym's policy, not necessarily him being in the wrong.\n\nHowever, his approach to the conversation might be part of the issue. When he asked his girlfriend if she'd go to a gym that excluded women, it could come across as dismissive of her reasons for supporting the women-only section. Instead of understanding her perspective, he's applying a hypothetical that might oversimplify the situation. His girlfriend's frustration could stem from feeling that he's not acknowledging the different experiences and needs of women.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's objection might be valid if he's concerned about equal treatment, but the way he's approaching the conversation might be problematic. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for his stance. If the gym's policy is legal and intended to support women, then the author isn't necessarily wrong for objecting based on his principles. However, if his objection is causing conflict without understanding the purpose behind the women-only section, he might be seen as not empathizing with his girlfriend's perspective.\n\nIn terms of the answer, the user is asking for A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not wrong). Based on the analysis, the author's stance isn't inherently wrong, but his communication might be. Since the question is about whether he's in the wrong for his stance, not his communication, the answer might lean towards B (he's not wrong). However, some might argue that he's not considering the context and needs of women, making A the answer. I think the key is that his objection is based on a principle of equality, which is valid, so he's not necessarily wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
