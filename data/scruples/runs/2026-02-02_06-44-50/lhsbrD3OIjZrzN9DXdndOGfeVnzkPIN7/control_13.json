Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is a guy who doesn't want to switch to his girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. The key points here are about gender equity and shared spaces.\n\nSo, the gym charges the same fee for both genders, but the women-only section restricts men from using part of the equipment and area. The author argues that this is sexist because men are paying the same but getting less access. His girlfriend thinks it's different for women, maybe because women-only spaces are meant to address historical exclusion or provide a safer environment. \n\nI need to consider whether the author's stance is valid. From a fairness perspective, if men and women are charged the same but have different access, that's unequal treatment. But there's also the aspect of creating safe spaces for women, which is a common argument in favor of such sections. The author is essentially saying that if women can have a section they can use exclusively, then men should also be allowed to have similar exclusive access if they wanted, but that's not the case here. So, his argument is about equality and consistency.\n\nHowever, his girlfriend's response is that it's different for women, which might be based on the idea that women historically haven't had equal access and need these spaces for safety or comfort. The author is pointing out the inconsistency in the treatment, which could be seen as a valid point from a fairness standpoint. On the other hand, if the women-only section is intended to provide a safe environment, then the author's refusal to participate might not be the issue, but the gym's policy could be problematic for different reasons.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. His position is based on the principle that charging the same fee while restricting access is discriminatory. If the gym allows women to have a section that men can't use, then from the author's perspective, that's unequal. Unless there's a valid reason (like legal or safety reasons) to have such a section, the author's argument holds. However, if the gym has a legitimate reason for the women-only section, then the author's objection might be less about sexism and more about personal preference. But the author is not against the section per se, but against being restricted in access without equivalent benefits.\n\nSo, from a neutral standpoint, the author is pointing out an inconsistency in how the gym's policy treats both genders. If the gym allows women to have a space they can use exclusively, then men should logically have the same option if they wanted. Since they don't, the author is highlighting a potential issue of unequal treatment. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out this inconsistency. His girlfriend's reaction that he's being stupid might be because she sees the women-only section as beneficial, but the author's argument is about fairness and equality in access.\n"
