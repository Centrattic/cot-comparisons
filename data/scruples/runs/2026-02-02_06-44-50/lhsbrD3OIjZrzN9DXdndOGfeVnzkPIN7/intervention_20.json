Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch to his girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The gym charges the same fee for everyone but has a women-only section that blocks men from using a quarter of the equipment and space. The author is arguing that this is sexist because men pay the same but get less access. The girlfriend disagrees, saying it's different for women.\n\nThe key points here are about equality and perceived sexism. The author is concerned about fair treatment, pointing out that men can't access the women-only area, which reduces their available resources. The girlfriend's response suggests she sees the women-only section as beneficial for women, perhaps for safety or comfort reasons.\n\nNow, considering the moral and ethical standpoint. The author's argument is based on equal access to facilities for the same price. If the gym charges equally but restricts access based on gender, that could be seen as discriminatory. But there's also the argument that women-only spaces exist to address historical disadvantages, providing a safe environment where women can work out without feeling intimidated. \n\nHowever, from the author's perspective, it's about fairness. If he's being charged the same but can't access the same facilities, that's a valid concern. The gym's policy might be intended to support women, but it's causing inequity for men in terms of access relative to cost. \n\nBut wait, maybe the women-only section is meant to be exclusive, not as a restriction on men. In that case, the author is not being excluded from the entire gym, just part of it. So the total available equipment for men is 75%, but women can use 100% (their own section plus the rest). The author is paying the same fee but using less equipment. That's a valid point about resource allocation. \n\nBut then, maybe the author's issue is with the principle of gender-based restrictions. The question is whether it's sexist. If the gym offers the same price but limited access based on gender, that could be seen as discriminatory. However, if the women-only section exists to address specific needs (like safety or comfort), then it's a different matter. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests she doesn't see the problem, which might indicate a difference in how they perceive fairness. The author is focusing on equal access to the same facilities for the same price, while the girlfriend sees the women-only section as a positive thing for women. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whose perspective is more valid. The author's concern about equal access is valid, but the existence of the women-only section might be justified for women's empowerment. However, if the gym is charging the same price but effectively giving different access, the author's point stands. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's arguing that the gym is discriminatory by restricting access based on gender, then he might have a valid point. But if the women-only section is intended to support women and not to exclude men, then the author's refusal to join could be seen as not understanding the purpose. \n\nBut the key is whether the gym's policy is fair. If men pay the same but can't access all areas, it's a problem. The author's analogy (asking if she would do the same if roles were reversed) highlights the inconsistency in treatment. If the girlfriend wouldn't accept that, then the author's point is valid. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The issue is about differing views on fairness and the role of gender in access to facilities. The author is standing up for equal treatment, which is reasonable. The answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
