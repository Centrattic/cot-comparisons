Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author not wanting to switch gyms with his girlfriend because her gym has a women-only section. The author's main point is that he feels it's unfair that men would pay the same fee but only have access to 75% of the equipment, which is the non-women-only part. The girlfriend thinks the author is being unreasonable and says it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of gender equity in public spaces. The gym offers a women-only section, which might be intended to create a safe or more comfortable environment for women. However, the author is pointing out that men aren't getting equal access to facilities when they pay the same price. That seems like a valid concern about equal access. If the gym charges the same for both genders but restricts access based on sex, that could be seen as discriminatory against men, even if the women-only section exists for the opposite reason.\n\nThen there's the girlfriend's perspective. She might believe that the women-only section is necessary for her and other women to feel safe or to avoid harassment, which is a legitimate concern many women face in gyms. However, she might not realize that from the author's viewpoint, this setup is also discriminatory towards him. The author is pointing out the inconsistency in treatment, which isn't about wanting to use the women-only area but about unequal access based on gender.\n\nThe key here is whether the gym's policy is discriminatory. If the gym is charging the same for both genders but limiting the facilities available to one gender, that could be a legal issue in some places, depending on equal access laws. However, if the women-only area is a voluntary option and men are still allowed to use the rest of the gym, then maybe the author's objection is about personal preference rather than discrimination. But if the gym is forcing men to pay full price for only 75% of the space, that's different from a separate facility where you can choose to use either section. The author's argument is that the gym isn't providing equal value for money, which is a fair point. The girlfriend might not see it that way because she's using the women-only section, but the author's issue is about the unequal access, not about using the women-only area himself.\n\nAnother angle is the comparison the author made: if the gym did the same to women, would that be acceptable? That's a standard in equality arguments. If the girlfriend would be upset if she were excluded from part of the gym, then the author's point is valid. However, she might argue that women need that space for their own reasons, but that doesn't negate the author's concern about unequal treatment.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's about whether the author is justified in his stance. If the gym is indeed providing unequal access based on sex, then the author isn't wrong to point that out. However, if the gym's policy is intended to address different needs (like safety for women), then the author's objection might be seen as not considering the reasons behind the policy. But the core issue is the unequal access regardless of intent.\n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for having this concern. The problem lies in the gym's policy creating unequal access. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
