Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the woman's gym has a women-only section. The author objects to joining because they think it's sexist, as men would be excluded from a quarter of the gym. The girlfriend is upset and says it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author's main point is about fairness and equal access. They argue that paying the same fee but having less access is discriminatory. The girlfriend, on the other hand, seems to support the women-only section, which might be for reasons like creating a safe space for women to work out without male presence, which can be a common concern for many women in gyms.\n\nNow, the key here is whether the author is being sexist by objecting to the women-only section. The author is pointing out a disparity in access based on gender, which could be seen as a valid concern. However, the women-only section might exist to address issues like harassment or to provide a supportive environment for women. The author's analogy to reverse the situation highlights their point, but the girlfriend's response suggests she sees the women-only area as necessary.\n\nIs the author wrong? It's possible that they are not understanding the purpose behind the women-only section. If the gym allows a segregated area for women, it's often to promote inclusivity for them, which is a different form of addressing gender inequality. The author might be seeing the exclusion as unfair, but the existence of such sections can be a way to counteract systemic issues women face in male-dominated spaces like gyms.\n\nBut then again, the author is also making a logical argument about equal access. If the gym charges everyone the same but restricts part of the facility to women, it's a form of segregation that could be seen as discriminatory against men. However, this is a complex issue where both sides have valid points. The author's concern is about fairness, while the girlfriend's support for the section is about safety and comfort for women.\n\nIn terms of being the \"asshole,\" it's about whose actions are more inconsiderate. The author is trying to express their discomfort with what they perceive as unequal treatment. The girlfriend is defending the gym's policy based on her needs. If the author is genuinely not understanding the purpose of the women-only section and is making the situation about their own feelings rather than the girlfriend's needs, they might be in the wrong. But if the author is just trying to communicate their perspective, maybe they aren't.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether their objection is sexist or a valid concern. The author's argument is that the gym's policy is sexist because it restricts access based on gender. However, the existence of women-only spaces can be justified as a way to address historical and ongoing issues women face in certain environments. So, the author might be missing that nuance, thinking it's about equal access rather than addressing different needs.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong because they are pointing out a potential fairness issue. But if the women-only section is intended to create a safe space, then the author's objection might not consider the broader social context. However, the author's stance is about equal treatment, which is a valid point, even if it's not the only valid perspective. The girlfriend's response of calling them stupid and being upset might be the bigger issue, but the question is about the author's wrongness. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer could be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are raising a valid concern about equal access, even if the girlfriend has different priorities. The author isn't being sexist by pointing out the disparity, but they might not fully grasp the purpose of the women-only section. However, the situation is nuanced, and neither side is entirely wrong. But according to the question's parameters, the answer is either A or B. Given that, the author's argument is about equal treatment, which is a legitimate concern, so they're not in the wrong. Therefore, answer B.\n"
