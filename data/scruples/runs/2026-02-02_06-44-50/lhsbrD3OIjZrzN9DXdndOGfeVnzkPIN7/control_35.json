Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because of the \"women only\" section. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend suggested moving to her gym for carpooling and working out together. The author's issue is that the gym has a women-only section, which takes up a quarter of the total space and equipment. The author argues that paying the same fee but having access to less equipment because of gender is sexist. The girlfriend dismisses his concern, saying \"it's different for women.\"\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the points. The gym charges the same fee for both genders but restricts part of the facility to women. This seems like gender-based discrimination against men. The author is pointing out that if a woman were charged the same but couldn't use part of the gym, it would be seen as sexist. The girlfriend's response that it's \"different\" might be invalidating the author's concern.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend might argue that the women-only section is for women's safety or comfort. But the author's main point is about equal access for the same price, which is a valid argument against discriminatory practices. The gym's policy here seems to limit access based on sex without a justifiable reason that applies equally to both genders. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't wrong in pointing out the inconsistency. The girlfriend's frustration might stem from not seeing the sexism in the policy. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
