Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe author and their girlfriend both work out, but they've been going to different gyms. The girlfriend suggested switching to the same gym so they can carpool and work out together. The issue is that this new gym has a \"women only\" section. The author is uncomfortable because the entrance fee is the same for everyone, but the women's section takes up a quarter of the space and equipment. The author argues that paying full price but only having access to 75% of the equipment is unfair based on their sex. The girlfriend thinks the author is overreacting and says it's different for women. The author is now unsure if they're the asshole for not wanting to go to that gym.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the gym's policy, the fairness of the pricing model, and the author's objection based on equality. The author is equating the situation to a hypothetical where women are charged the same but can't use certain equipment, which the girlfriend dismisses as not applicable. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the validity of the author's concern. The gym offers a women-only section, which is legal in many places as a form of single-sex space for privacy and comfort reasons. However, the author is paying the same fee as women who use the women-only section but can't access that part. The author's argument is that they're being discriminated against by having access to less equipment for the same price. But wait, the women are paying the same fee but can access the women-only section and the rest? Or is the fee for the entire gym, including the women-only area? Wait, the description says the gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but the women-only section only allows women. So, if the author is a man, he can't use the women's section, but women can use both their section and the rest. So the author is paying full fee but can't access part of the gym. Women pay the same fee and can access the whole gym? Or do they have access to the women-only section plus the rest? Wait, the problem states that the women's section is a part of the gym. So perhaps the entire gym is available to everyone except that section is reserved for women. So, the author is paying full price but can't access the women-only section, which is a quarter of the equipment. So the author can use 75% of the gym's equipment and area, while women can use all of it. That seems like a disparity. \n\nBut from the girlfriend's perspective, the women-only section is for their benefit, maybe for women to feel more comfortable. The author's objection is about equal access to equipment for the same price. But the gym is structured to have a single-sex space, which might be a form of affirmative action or promoting women's participation in fitness. However, if the pricing is the same, then the gym is effectively giving women more value for the same price, which could be seen as discriminatory to men. Or maybe it's not, since the women-only section is a specific service that the gym offers, and the pricing might not be directly tied to the equipment access in that way. \n\nThe author's analogy is asking the girlfriend if she would be okay with a gym that charged women the same but restricted their access to part of the equipment. That's a classic \"would you support the opposite if the genders were reversed?\" argument. The girlfriend says it's different for women, implying that the women-only section serves a purpose beyond just access, like safety, comfort, or promoting women in a male-dominated space. The author might not be considering that the women-only section is intended to address historical inequalities in access to fitness spaces, where women might feel unwelcome or unsafe in co-ed gyms. Therefore, the author's objection could be seen as overlooking the reasons behind the women-only section, even if it leads to a disparity in access.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the gym's policy is aimed at addressing a specific need (like providing a safe space for women), then the author's refusal to accept it might be seen as not understanding the rationale behind the policy. However, if the gym is charging the same price but restricting access to part of the facility based on gender, that could be seen as discriminatory against men. But the key here is that the women-only section is a positive discrimination measure to encourage women's participation, which might be a valid reason even if it leads to some inequality in the opposite direction. \n\nThe author might not be considering the intent behind the women-only section. Their argument is based on equal access, but the gym's policy is about providing a specific service to women. The girlfriend's frustration comes from the author not grasping that the reason for the section is different for women than it would be for men. So the author's analogy doesn't hold because the contexts are different. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not understanding the purpose of the women-only section and equating it to a scenario where women are restricted, which isn't the case here. The gym isn't restricting women's access; they're allowing them exclusive access to a part of the facility to address their needs. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're failing to recognize the purpose and justification for the women-only section, even if the pricing seems unequal. However, some might argue that the pricing is discriminatory regardless of intent, but the question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to go to that gym. The core issue is whether the author's reasoning is valid. Since the policy is intended to promote gender equality in a different way, the author's objection might be based on a misunderstanding of that intent, making them the asshole here.\n"
