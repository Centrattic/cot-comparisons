Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let's start by breaking down the scenario. The author and his girlfriend both work out at different gyms. The girlfriend wants him to switch to her gym so they can carpool and work out together. The problem is that her gym has a women-only section that takes up a quarter of the gym's area and equipment. The author is objecting because he thinks it's sexist that men have to pay the same fee but can't use that section. The girlfriend gets upset when he questions if she would accept the reverse situation.\n\nFirst, I should consider the main points here. The gym has a women-only section, which is a common feature in some gyms to provide a safer or more comfortable space for women. The author is upset that by paying the same fee, men gain access to the entire gym, while women are restricted in the author's gym (assuming his gym doesn't have a male-only section). But the author's issue is specifically with his girlfriend's gym's policy. \n\nHe's arguing that it's unfair that men pay full price but can't use part of the gym, while women can. His girlfriend counters that \"it's different for women,\" implying that the women-only section serves a purpose she doesn't understand. The author's question about whether she would accept the reverse situation might be valid, but he's being confrontational, which could be why she's upset.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if the gym charges the same for everyone but restricts access to certain areas based on gender, it could be seen as discriminatory against the group that's excluded. However, the existence of women-only areas is often justified as a way to address historical underrepresentation or to create a safer environment. In many places, such spaces are considered necessary for gender equity.\n\nThe author's comparison might not hold because the existence of a women-only section in his girlfriend's gym doesn't necessarily mean that his gym has a male-only section. If his gym is co-ed and doesn't have exclusions, then the comparison isn't equivalent. The author is assuming that the inverse situation would be the same, but that might not be accurate. \n\nAdditionally, the author is approaching the situation from his perspective without fully considering the reasons his girlfriend might support the women-only section. She could be in favor of such spaces as a form of empowerment or for safety. By dismissing her stance as \"stupid,\" he's not engaging in a constructive dialogue. \n\nThe key question is whether the gym's policy is inherently sexist. If the gym is providing equal access to all members except for the women-only section, and the fee is the same, it's a matter of whether the exclusion is justified. Some argue that such spaces are feminist and necessary. Others might see it as unequal treatment. \n\nIn terms of the author's actions, he's not wrong in expressing his discomfort, but his approach might be confrontational. Instead of accusing his girlfriend of being wrong, he could have discussed his feelings and tried to find a compromise. By asking her if she would accept the reverse, he's implying that her position is inconsistent, which might not be the case if the contexts differ. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. If the women-only section is a valid and accepted practice, then the author's objection is based on a misunderstanding. However, if the gym's policy is indeed discriminatory (same fee but restricted access), then the author has a point. But given that women-only spaces are often defended as positive for gender equality, the author might not be wrong, but he could be approaching the situation in a way that's dismissive of his girlfriend's viewpoint. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer isn't straightforward. However, the author's stance might be seen as not considering the reasons behind the women-only section, leading to conflict. Therefore, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't fully understand her perspective, or B (not in the wrong) because he's pointing out a potential inconsistency. The key here is whether the women-only section is considered a fair policy. If it's a legitimate practice, then the author is wrong to criticize it, hence answer A. If the policy is seen as discriminatory, then answer B. Since the question is from the author's point of view, the answer hinges on societal views. Given that many support women-only spaces, the author might be in the wrong for not understanding, so answer A.\n"
