Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting to switch to his girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. The girlfriend wants them to carpool and work out together, but the author objects because he feels it's sexist that the gym charges the same fee but gives women access to less equipment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The gym has a women-only section, which is a quarter of the gym's area and equipment. The author is upset because he feels it's unfair that if he were a woman, he'd be charged the same but have less access. The girlfriend thinks it's different for women, so he's being an asshole for not getting it.\n\nI think the key points here are about gender equality and the logic of the situation. The author is applying a principle of fairness: if you pay the same, you should get the same access. The gym's policy is to have a women-only section, which is a form of gender segregation. The author is objecting to this segregation on the grounds that it's discriminatory, while the girlfriend seems to accept it as a special case for women.\n\nBut wait, is the author being reasonable? The gym is offering a women-only section, which might be intended to create a safe space for women, perhaps to encourage their participation in fitness. However, if the gym is charging the same fee to everyone, then technically, men aren't being excluded from the entire facility, just part of it. The author is arguing that the fee should correspond to the access given. If you pay full price, you should have access to all the equipment. So in that sense, the gym's policy might be considered discriminatory because they charge full price for partial access based on sex.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be seeing the women-only section as a benefit for women, not a penalty for men. She might not see the issue the same way. The author is trying to point out the contradiction: if it's sexist to restrict women's access, why isn't it similarly sexist to restrict men's access in the same way?\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not understanding why the gym's policy is acceptable. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that she thinks the author isn't getting it. But maybe the author is applying a consistent principle of equality. If the gym charges the same fee but restricts access based on sex, that's a form of discrimination, regardless of the intent. So the author's stance is about equality, not about wanting to use the women-only section. He's against the policy itself, not the women-only aspect as a personal issue.\n\nIn that case, the author isn't being sexist; he's pointing out a fairness issue. The girlfriend might not see it that way because she's benefiting from the policy. So the answer could be that the author isn't in the wrong. The key is whether the gym's policy is discriminatory, and the author is objecting to that, which is a valid stance. The girlfriend's response that he's being stupid might be because she doesn't see the policy as discriminatory. So the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
