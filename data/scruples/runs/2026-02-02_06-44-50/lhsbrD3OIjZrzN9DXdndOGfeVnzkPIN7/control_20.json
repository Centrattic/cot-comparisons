Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the girlfriend suggests they go to the same gym for convenience, but the writer objects because the gym has a women-only section that restricts access based on gender. The main issue is the perceived sexism in the gym's policy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The gym charges the same fee for everyone but has a section that's exclusively for women. The writer's objection is that if the gym charges men the same as women but doesn't let them use the women-only area, it's unfair. The girlfriend doesn't see it that way and thinks it's different for women. The writer is asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the question is about whether gender-based restrictions are inherently sexist or if there's a valid reason for such sections. Gyms often have women-only areas to create a space where women feel more comfortable, perhaps for modesty or safety reasons. But from the writer's perspective, it's a form of discrimination since men can't access that section, even though they pay the same.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The writer is pointing out a potential inconsistency: if a policy restricts access based on gender, it could be seen as discriminatory, regardless of the intent. On the other hand, the girlfriend might argue that the women-only section addresses specific needs and isn't meant to exclude men. However, if the gym is charging the same fee but limiting access to certain areas based on gender, it's a bit of a paradox. It's like saying you're welcome here but not there because of your sex. That could be seen as unfair from the writer's viewpoint.\n\nBut then again, maybe the women-only section isn't meant to exclude men entirely but to provide a safe space for women. The gym might have equal access in the other sections. So, the writer's objection is about the inequity of access based on gender, even if the fee is the same. The girlfriend's response that \"it's different for women\" might stem from her perspective that such spaces are necessary and not discriminatory.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. If the gym is allowing women to have a section where they can work out without men, that's a choice the gym makes, possibly for women's comfort. The writer is objecting to that policy, which could be seen as not understanding the need for such spaces. However, if the gym is charging men the same as women but doesn't let them use that section, it's a form of gender-based restriction that the writer finds unfair. \n\nThe key here is whether the policy is discriminatory. If the gym is allowing women-only areas but men can use the rest, maybe the writer's stance is valid in terms of equal access. However, the intent behind the policy might matter. If the women-only section is meant to create inclusivity for women, then the gym is providing a choice, not forcing anyone to use it. The writer is choosing not to go to a gym that has such a policy because it's sexist. That's a personal choice, but is it wrong?\n\nAlternatively, the writer's argument is that if you're paying the same fee, you should have access to all areas. The girlfriend's response suggests she doesn't see it that way, which creates a conflict. The writer might be right in his reasoning if he's standing against gender-based restrictions, but the girlfriend might be right in her need for that space. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the gym's policy is legal and not outright discriminatory (like in some places where women-only sections are allowed for safety reasons), then the author's objection is more about personal values. \n\nBut if the gym is essentially giving women a larger portion of the facility without reciprocal access for men, even though they pay the same, that's a form of gender-based inequity. The author is pointing out that inconsistency. So, maybe the author isn't wrong for holding that view. However, if the women-only section is just a small part and the rest is co-ed, the author could still access the majority of the gym. But the fact that the gym has such a policy might be the root of the issue. \n\nIn terms of the relationship, the author is trying to express his values and is being honest. The girlfriend might feel that he's not considering her needs. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whose perspective is more valid. The answer might hinge on whether such policies are considered acceptable or discriminatory. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and given the context, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is objecting to a policy he sees as sexist, which is a valid stance. However, if the policy is designed to address specific issues for women, the girlfriend's stance might be valid too. But the question is about the author's rightness, not the policy's intent. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. He's challenging a policy he perceives as discriminatory based on gender, which is a legitimate concern.\n"
