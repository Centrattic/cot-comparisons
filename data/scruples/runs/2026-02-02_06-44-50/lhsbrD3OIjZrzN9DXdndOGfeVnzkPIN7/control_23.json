Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author and his girlfriend both go to different gyms. The girlfriend suggests they switch to the same gym to carpool and work out together. The problem is that her gym has a \"women only\" section. The author is upset because the gym charges the same fee for everyone, but women get access to the whole gym plus the women-only section, while he would only get access to 75% of the equipment if he went there. He compares it to the gym charging women the same as men but restricting men from using some equipment. His girlfriend thinks he's being stupid and says it's different for women.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the gym has a women-only section. That's a common practice in some gyms to provide a space where women feel more comfortable. However, the author is arguing that it's unfair because he would be paying the same fee but getting less access. He's equating it to a scenario where women pay the same but men can't use certain equipment. His girlfriend dismisses his argument and says he doesn't understand.\n\nNow, the key point here is whether the author's reasoning is valid or not. The author's main argument is about equity in access. If both pay the same, but one gender has more access, is that sexist? On the surface, it sounds like a logical inconsistency. But the girlfriend's point is that it's different for women\u2014maybe the women-only section is meant to address past inequalities or provide a safer space. So is the author being sexist by not accepting this?\n\nWait, but the author isn't being asked to use the women-only section. He's being asked to go to a gym where part of it is women-only. If he's not using that section, then he's only getting access to 75% of the gym's equipment. The gym charges the same, so he feels like he's getting a worse deal. But maybe the women-only section is considered part of the value for women, but not for men. The author is comparing it to a reverse situation where women have access to less, but that's not the case here. If the gym allows women to use the entire space plus the women-only area, while men can't access the women-only part, then the women are getting more access, but they're being charged the same. The author is pointing out that if the roles were reversed, it would be seen as unfair.\n\nBut the girlfriend is saying it's different for women. Maybe she's referring to the fact that women-only sections can be empowering for women, providing a space without male presence, which might be important for their comfort and confidence. The author, however, is looking at the practical aspect of access and cost. So is his argument valid?\n\nIn terms of justice, if two people pay the same fee but have different access, that could be considered unequal. However, the intention behind the women-only section is to provide a safe space, which might be seen as a positive discrimination to address historical issues. The author's objection is about the equity in what they're receiving for the same price, while the girlfriend is emphasizing the need for such sections for women.\n\nSo, is the author wrong for not accepting this arrangement? The author is not being sexist for pointing out the inequality in access if the gym charges the same. However, the girlfriend might be right that the women-only section serves a different purpose than just increasing equipment access. The author's comparison to the reverse situation might be valid in terms of equity, but the context and intent matter. The women-only section isn't about giving women more equipment but about creating a supportive environment. Therefore, the author's objection might be missing the intended purpose, but that doesn't necessarily make him wrong about the access issue.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the gym is structured that way intentionally, perhaps for good reasons, then the author's refusal to go there isn't necessarily wrong. He's not obligated to accept a system that he finds unfair. The girlfriend's frustration comes from not seeing the author's perspective, and the author is trying to highlight the inconsistency. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, because he's pointing out a valid point about access for the same price, even if the context is different.\n"
