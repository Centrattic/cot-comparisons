Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because of the women-only section. \n\nFirst, the key points: The author and his girlfriend go to different gyms. She wants him to switch to hers for carpooling and working out together. The issue is that her gym has a \"women only\" section, which takes up a quarter of the space and equipment. The author argues that it's sexist because men would pay the same fee but not have access to all areas. The girlfriend thinks it's different for women, which upsets her.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's reasoning is that if men were charged the same but had less access, it would be unfair. He draws a parallel to his girlfriend's situation. The girlfriend feels that the women's section is necessary, perhaps for safety or comfort, and the author isn't grasping that nuance.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author has a valid point. Charging equal fees while restricting access based on gender could be seen as discriminatory. However, the existence of the women-only section is likely intended to provide a safe space for women, which is a common practice in many gyms. The author might not realize that this isn't about preferential treatment but about addressing historical inequalities or creating a comfortable environment.\n\nBut the author is pointing out a discrepancy: if the gym allows certain restrictions based on gender, it could be considered sexist in the opposite direction. However, the context here is important. Women-only spaces are often created to counteract the underrepresentation of women in fitness and to create a judgment-free zone. The author is missing this context, leading to the conflict.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the intent and the context. The author isn't being sexist towards women but is failing to understand the rationale behind the women-only section. The girlfriend, on the other hand, sees it as necessary. The author's approach might come off as dismissive of her perspective, not understanding that her stance isn't about exclusion but inclusion. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong in terms of fairness but could be in the wrong for not empathizing with his girlfriend's viewpoint and the reasons behind the gym's policy. However, the core issue of the gym's policy is a matter of opinion. \n\nIn the AITA format, the community often looks for understanding and compromise. The author's refusal to switch gyms might be seen as not being accommodating enough, but his reasoning is based on a valid concern. The girlfriend's frustration comes from him not understanding her needs. So, there's a balance here. The author might not be the asshole but could be the one who needs to see the other side. Alternatively, if the gym's policy is indeed a form of reverse discrimination, the author is justified. But given that it's a women-only section meant for empowerment, the author might not be in the wrong. Wait, but if the gym allows women to have their own space without charging them extra, maybe the author is pointing out a logical inconsistency. However, if the gym provides equal access in other areas and the women-only section is optional, then his argument might not hold. The problem is that the gym isn't restricting all men; it's just a section. The author's analogy of charging men the same but restricting their access is flawed because the women-only section isn't the same as denying men access to everything. The author's analogy might be taking the situation to an extreme. Therefore, the author might be overreacting by not considering the purpose of the women-only section. So, he's not in the wrong for expressing his concern, but he could be in the wrong for not trying to understand his girlfriend's perspective. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because his reasoning is based on a fair point about equal access, even if he's not getting the context. The gym's policy isn't necessarily discriminatory if the rest of the gym is open to everyone. The author's issue is with the women-only section, but that's a separate part of the gym. So, he's not wrong for objecting to that policy, even if it's a point of contention between them.\n"
