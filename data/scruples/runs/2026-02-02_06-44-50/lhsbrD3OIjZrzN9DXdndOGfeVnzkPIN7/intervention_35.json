Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy not wanting to switch gyms with his girlfriend because the gym has a women-only section. The author argues that it's sexist because men can't use that part of the gym even though they pay the same fee. The girlfriend thinks the author is being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's main point is about equality and fairness. If a gym charges everyone the same but restricts access to certain areas based on gender, that could be seen as discriminatory. The author is comparing it to if women were charged more or had less access, which they wouldn't accept. So, from the author's viewpoint, it's about equal access for all, regardless of gender.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might see the women-only section as a positive thing. Maybe it's a safe space for women to work out without feeling uncomfortable, especially in areas like changing rooms or certain classes. Some women prefer these sections for privacy or to avoid feeling judged. The author's objection could be seen as not understanding the need for such spaces, which are meant to address historical inequalities and provide comfort.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for objecting. The key points are: Is gender-based segregation in gyms inherently sexist? And is the author's argument valid?\n\nIn many places, gender-segregated spaces are allowed if they serve a legitimate purpose, like safety or comfort. For example, locker rooms and certain classes (like women-only yoga) exist for these reasons. The author's argument that it's unfair because men can't use those sections might not take into account the purpose behind those areas. However, if the gym is charging the same fee but limiting access, that could be seen as a problem unless the women-only section is part of a broader equal access policy (like men having their own sections too, which they don't in this case).\n\nBut here, the gym has a women-only section but no men-only sections. So, the argument is that men are paying for access to the entire gym but can't use certain parts. The author is saying that's unequal treatment. However, the existence of such sections might be justified as addressing female-specific needs, like safety or comfort, which are valid considerations.\n\nThe author's analogy to women being charged more or restricted is a fair point, but the context is different. Women-only spaces are often a response to a history of exclusion and harassment. The author might not see the necessity of these spaces, but the girlfriend does. So the author's objection could be seen as not recognizing the need for such spaces, which are meant to provide equal opportunity in a different form.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the gym allows women to have a section where they can feel safe and comfortable, it's a way to ensure their access to the gym, which might otherwise be hindered by discomfort or harassment. The author's stance might be ignoring the underlying reasons for the women-only section. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not understanding the purpose of those spaces and dismissing his girlfriend's perspective.\n\nBut there's also the counterpoint that if the gym charges equal fees but restricts access based on gender, it's a form of discrimination. However, the justification for such restrictions is usually based on specific needs. The line here is whether the policy is discriminatory or accommodating. The author's argument is that it's discriminatory because it's not reciprocal, but the existence of women-only sections is often seen as a necessary accommodation rather than discrimination.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's position is based on a principle of equal access without considering the specific needs that the women-only sections aim to address. The girlfriend's stance is about creating a safe and comfortable environment for women, which is a valid need. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not recognizing the necessity of such spaces, even if they don't personally agree with them.\n"
