Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple considering working out together at the same gym, but the guy objects because the gym has a women-only section that takes up a quarter of the space and equipment. The man argues it's sexist because he would be paying the same fee but not have access to all the equipment. The girlfriend got upset when he compared it to her being denied access if the roles were reversed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of gender segregation in facilities. Some places have separate areas for men and women for various reasons, like modesty or safety. In this case, the gym charges the same fee, so men can access the entire gym, while women are restricted to part of it. The man is upset because he sees it as unequal treatment. He's making a logical argument about equal access for equal payment.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman might be defending the women-only section because it's intended to provide a safer or more comfortable space for women. Maybe she feels it's necessary and doesn't see it as discriminatory in the same way. It's possible she's used to it or believes it serves a purpose that the man isn't considering.\n\nThe man's argument is based on equality and fairness. If he's paying the same, he expects the same access. But the existence of the women-only area might not be inherently sexist if it's optional and the men can use the entire space. However, the fact that women are restricted from part of the gym could be seen as discriminatory, especially if the fee is the same. The man is pointing out a discrepancy that he perceives as unequal treatment.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also important. She called him \"stupid\" and said it's \"different for women,\" which might indicate she's defensive. Her response suggests she might not see the parallel in his argument. But from the man's perspective, if the situation were reversed, it would be seen as unfair, so she might be inconsistent in her viewpoint.\n\nBut maybe the women-only section isn't about discrimination but about creating a safe space. In that case, the gym might have a valid reason. However, if men can access all areas while women can't, that does seem unequal, even if the fees are the same. The key is whether the restriction is justified. Without more context, it's hard to say, but the man's argument is about equal access for equal cost.\n\nSo, is the man in the wrong? If the gym's policy is not discriminatory and the women-only section is optional, maybe not. But if the policy restricts access based on gender without a justifiable reason, then the man's objection is valid. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because he's pointing out a logical inconsistency in the gym's policy. The answer would be B (No).\n"
