Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because of the women-only section. The scenario is that the girlfriend wants them to go to her gym, but it has a section exclusive to women. The author objects because they feel it's sexist\u2014paying the same fee but restricted to 75% of the equipment. The girlfriend is upset and says it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of single-sex spaces. They can be important for women's safety, comfort, and to address historical underrepresentation in fitness. However, the author's argument is about equal access. If men pay the same fee but can't use all areas, that could be seen as discriminatory. But maybe the women-only section is meant to provide a space for women without harassment or to encourage female participation in fitness, which is a valid purpose.\n\nThe key here is whether the gym is being fair. If the women-only section is a separate facility within the same gym, perhaps the entrance fee covers access to both the shared and exclusive areas. So men could use the shared 75% and women can use all areas. If that's the case, it's not exactly the same as the author's hypothetical about women being excluded. The author is pointing out a discrepancy in access based on gender. \n\nBut the girlfriend's reaction suggests she doesn't see it as a problem. She might believe that the women-only section serves a specific purpose, like creating a safe environment. The author is trying to highlight the inconsistency in treatment between genders. However, the issue might not be about equal access in the traditional sense but about creating spaces that address historical inequalities. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the gym's policy is intended to promote inclusion for women, then the author's objection might stem from not understanding that intent. On the other hand, if the policy leads to men being excluded from certain areas without justification, it could be seen as discriminatory. The line is blurry here. The author's argument is logical, but the girlfriend's perspective is also valid. The answer might depend on cultural or societal norms regarding gendered spaces. In this case, the author isn't necessarily wrong for not wanting to support a policy they find discriminatory, but the girlfriend's reasoning about women's needs might be valid too. So, the author isn't in the wrong because they're highlighting a potential inconsistency, even if the girlfriend's reasons are understandable.\n"
