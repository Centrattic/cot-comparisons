Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend suggests they switch to the same gym so they can carpool and work out together. The man objects because the gym has a women-only section, which he finds sexist. He argues that paying the same fee but having restricted access based on gender is unfair. The girlfriend gets upset and says it's different for women.\n\nHmm. The core issue here is about gender equality and access to resources. The man is upset that the gym offers a women-only section which reduces the available equipment and area for men. He's drawing a parallel: if women were excluded from part of the gym, he wouldn't accept it, so why is it okay when men are excluded? The girlfriend, on the other hand, thinks it's different for women. \n\nI need to consider the context. Women-only sections in gyms are sometimes intended to create a safe and comfortable environment, addressing the underrepresentation of women in some gyms. However, from the man's perspective, it seems like a form of gender discrimination. But wait, if the gym charges everyone the same fee regardless of which section they use, but restricts access based on gender, is that fair? \n\nThe man's argument is that paying full price for only 75% of the equipment is discriminatory. However, the women-only section might be a choice, not a restriction. Maybe the gym is offering different options, but not forcing anyone to use them. If the man is being denied access to the women's section, that's a form of gender discrimination. But if the women's section is optional and the man is allowed to use the rest of the gym, then maybe the issue is more about principle than actual access.\n\nBut wait, the man is being excluded from a portion of the gym because he's male. That does sound like direct discrimination. However, the women-only section might be a proactive measure to support women's participation in fitness, addressing historical inequalities. The problem here is that the man is applying the same standard to both genders and not recognizing the different contexts. \n\nThe key question is whether the gym's policy is discriminatory. If the gym is allowing women to use a space where they can feel comfortable and safe, which is a recognized need, then the policy isn't inherently sexist. The man's refusal to accept this might stem from not understanding the reasons behind the women-only section. His comparison to if women were excluded might not be accurate because the contexts differ. Women's underrepresentation in gyms might necessitate such spaces, whereas men are the majority, so they don't face the same exclusion.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the gym's policy is intended to promote inclusivity for women and the man is objecting to it without understanding the reasoning, he might be the one being insensitive. However, his concern about fairness is valid if the policy is one-sided. If the gym allows women to have a space without excluding men, but men aren't given similar options, then the policy is discriminatory. But if the women-only section is just a choice and the man is still free to use the rest of the gym, then his objection is about a non-issue. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might be defensiveness because she's trying to explain the importance of such spaces for women, and the man isn't getting it. The author's stance is that the gym's policy is sexist, but maybe he's not considering the intent behind it. So, depending on the perspective, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), because the author is highlighting a potential inconsistency in how gender affects access. Alternatively, A (in the wrong) if the policy isn't discriminatory and he's overreacting.\n\nI think the right answer leans towards B. The author is challenging a policy that seems to offer unequal access, which is a valid concern. However, if the policy is designed to address a specific need and the author isn't acknowledging that, then it's a misunderstanding. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the gym's policy is discriminatory, then he's right. If it's not, then he's wrong. Since the woman-only section is a common practice and intended to support inclusivity, maybe the author is missing the point. But the policy does restrict access based on gender, which can be seen as discriminatory regardless of intent. So, it's a bit of a gray area. However, in many legal contexts, single-sex spaces are allowed for specific reasons like safety and comfort, so the gym's policy might be justified. Therefore, the author might be the asshole for not understanding and respecting this. But I'm still a bit conflicted. Hmm.\n"
