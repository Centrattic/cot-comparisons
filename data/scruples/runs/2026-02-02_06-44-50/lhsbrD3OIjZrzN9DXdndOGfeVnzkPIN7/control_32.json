Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to switch to his girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. So the situation is that the girlfriend suggested they both go to the same gym to carpool and work out together. The author's main issue is the women-only section that takes up a quarter of the gym and equipment. He argues that it's sexist because men can't use that section, while women can, even though they pay the same fee. The girlfriend thinks he's being unreasonable and that it's \"different for women.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of single-sex spaces. In many contexts, such as gyms, women-only sections exist to provide a safe environment where women might feel more comfortable or to address specific needs they might have. For example, some women prefer to exercise without men around due to safety concerns, cultural reasons, or personal comfort. The gym charges the same fee for everyone, which seems fair. The equipment in the women-only area isn't exclusively for women, but the access is restricted. \n\nThe author's argument is that it's sexist because he can't access all the equipment, but the girlfriend points out that the women-only section isn't inherently sexist from her perspective. She might see it as a necessary inclusion for women's comfort, similar to how there are women-only gyms or classes. \n\nIs the author wrong for not accepting this? Well, he's raising a valid point about equitable access. If the gym allows women to use a portion that men can't, but both pay the same, it could be seen as limiting access based on gender. However, the existence of such sections is often justified as meeting the needs of one gender. The author's objection is about fairness and access, while the girlfriend sees it as a necessary accommodation for women.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the gym provides equal value overall, like the rest of the gym is accessible to both, then maybe the author is overreacting. But if the women-only section is a form of segregation that limits access for men without providing a comparable alternative, that could be seen as discriminatory. However, in many places, businesses can offer different sections as long as they don't exclude people based on protected categories. \n\nThe key here is whether the gym's policy is discriminatory. If women are allowed to use the entire gym (including the women-only section) and men can use the rest, it's a choice made by the gym, not necessarily a violation of anti-discrimination laws. The author's issue is with the principle of it, but the girlfriend's stance is that it's important for women's inclusion and safety. \n\nIn relationships, differing priorities can lead to conflict. The author is standing by his principles, and the girlfriend might feel he's not respecting her needs. The question is whether his stance is reasonable. Since the gym isn't violating any laws and the existence of the women-only section serves a purpose for women, the author might be considered in the wrong for not understanding that perspective, but his argument about access is valid. However, since the gym isn't excluding men from the majority of the facility, maybe the author is overreacting. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because his concern about equal access is legitimate, but some might argue A (he is in the wrong) because the gym's policy isn't against him. But the question is whether he's in the wrong in this situation. The fact that the gym has a women-only section that he can't access, yet he pays the same, could be seen as a valid complaint. So the answer is B.\n"
