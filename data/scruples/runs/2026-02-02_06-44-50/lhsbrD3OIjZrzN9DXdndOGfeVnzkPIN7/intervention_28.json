Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not wanting to switch to his girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. The gym charges the same fee for both genders, but the women-only area restricts men from using a quarter of the equipment and space.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue here. The author's main concern is that the gym is discriminatory by allowing women to use a larger portion of the facility while charging the same entrance fee as men. He argues that if he paid the same fee, he should have access to all the equipment, not be restricted from a quarter of it. His girlfriend, on the other hand, sees the women-only section as beneficial for female members, perhaps providing a safe space or more privacy, which he doesn't recognize as a valid reason for the segregation.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the gym's policy might be considered discriminatory if it's based purely on gender without a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason. However, some gyms create women-only sections to encourage more women to join, offering a space where they might feel more comfortable, especially in areas like weight training where they might feel outnumbered or uncomfortable. But the key point here is that the gym charges the same fee regardless of which section you use. If the author is paying for access to the entire gym but isn't allowed to use all the equipment, that's a problem. It's like paying for a full membership but being restricted from certain areas based on gender.\n\nThe girlfriend might argue that the women-only section isn't about exclusion but inclusion\u2014providing a space for women who might not otherwise use the gym. However, that doesn't negate the fact that the author is being excluded from a portion of the gym's facilities. The author's comparison to a hypothetical where the roles are reversed (asking if she would accept being excluded) is a valid point. If the situation were reversed and men were excluded from a section, the author would likely find that unfair. So the principle here is about mutual access and fairness.\n\nLegally, in many places, gender-based segregation in public facilities can be problematic unless there's a valid reason, like privacy or safety. However, if the gym's policy is to have a women-only section, it might be protected under certain circumstances, such as providing a safe space. But the issue here isn't the existence of the women-only section itself but the fact that the author is being charged the same fee for access to the entire gym but can't use all the equipment. That's where the potential discrimination lies.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests she doesn't see the issue the same way. She might view the women-only section as a benefit for female members, which she might consider justified. However, the author's perspective is that it's an unfair restriction on his access. The crux of the problem is whether the gym's policy is discriminatory toward the author. If the gym is charging the same price for equal access, then the author is being denied access to a portion of the facilities based on his gender, which is a form of discrimination. That would make the author not in the wrong, because he's pointing out a potential fairness issue.\n\nOn the other hand, if the women-only section is intended to provide a specific need for female members, like a safe space for weight training, then the gym's policy could be seen as addressing that need. However, the fact remains that the author is paying for access to the entire gym but is restricted from a quarter of it. That's a real limitation on his access. So the author's argument is about fairness and equal access. He's being charged equally but not getting equal access to the facilities, which is a problem.\n\nIn terms of the relationship aspect, the author's refusal to switch gyms because of this policy might strain the relationship. However, the question isn't about relationship advice but whether the author is in the wrong. From a fairness standpoint, the author has a valid point. The gym's policy is discriminatory in terms of access for men, even if it's intended to benefit women. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to participate in a system that limits his access based on gender. The girlfriend's dismissal of his concern as being \"stupid\" suggests she doesn't see the issue the same way, but that doesn't make the author wrong; it just means they have differing perspectives on fairness and discrimination.\n"
