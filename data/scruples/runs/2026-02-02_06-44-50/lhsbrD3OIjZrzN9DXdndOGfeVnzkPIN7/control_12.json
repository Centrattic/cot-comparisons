Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the person who posted this is in the wrong. The situation is about whether it's sexist for the author to not want to go to the same gym as his girlfriend because the gym has a women-only section that blocks men from using part of the equipment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author's girlfriend suggested they go to her gym so they can carpool and work out together. The issue is the women-only section. The gym charges the same fee for both genders, but the women's section is a quarter of the gym's area and equipment. The author argues that if he pays the same fee, he should have access to all equipment. His girlfriend thinks this is different for women and got upset when he compared it.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is being sexist himself by not accepting the women-only section. The girlfriend might be in favor of such sections for women's comfort or safety. On the other hand, the author is pointing out a potential inconsistency in treatment based on gender, which could be seen as a fair point if the gym is charging equal fees but limiting access.\n\nI should consider legal and social contexts. In many places, laws require equal access unless there's a specific reason, like a women-only facility for safety or religious reasons. But a co-ed gym with a separate women-only area might be allowed if it's part of providing a safe space. However, if the gym is charging the same price but offering less access to men, that could be discriminatory. But if the women's section is optional and the rest is co-ed, maybe the author's issue is more about fairness.\n\nThe author's argument is that if he paid full fee, he should have full access. His girlfriend's stance is that it's different for women. The analogy he uses is that if she were restricted, she'd be upset. But she's not seeing it that way, which might be because she values the women-only section for reasons he doesn't understand.\n\nI need to determine if the author's position is valid. He's pointing out a disparity in access for the same price. If the gym allows women to use 100% of the equipment in their section plus the co-ed area, while men can only use the co-ed area, then women effectively have more access. But if the gym charges the same regardless of which sections you can use, that's a problem. The author is highlighting that inconsistency, which is a fair criticism from a fairness perspective.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the women-only section is meant to create a safe space, which is a valid reason. But if the gym is enforcing this without adjusting the price for men, it's discriminatory. The author's refusal to go there isn't about not wanting to be around women but about unequal treatment. So, he's not in the wrong for pointing out that inconsistency. The girlfriend might not see it as discriminatory because she benefits from it, but the author's concern is about equity.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (Not the asshole) because the author is raising a legitimate issue about unequal treatment based on sex, which is a valid concern.\n"
