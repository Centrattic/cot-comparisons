Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the author doesn't want to go to his girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. His main point is that he's being charged the same fee but can't use part of the gym, which he sees as sexist. The girlfriend thinks he's overreacting and says it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the gym. The women-only section is 1/4 of the gym's area and equipment. So, the rest is presumably co-ed. The author is saying that if he's charged the same as women but can't use a quarter of the equipment, that's unfair. But wait, the women-only section is for women only, but men can use the other 75%. So, he's not being charged more, but he's restricted from part of the facility. Is that okay?\n\nThe author's argument is based on gender-based restrictions. He's pointing out a double standard: if women can have a section they can use exclusively, but men can't use that part, he's being treated differently because of his sex. His girlfriend argues that it's different for women, which might be referring to women's preferences or needs, maybe feeling more comfortable in a single-sex environment. But is that a valid reason to create an imbalance?\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the gym allows women to have a section they can use without men, but men don't have a similar option, that could be seen as unequal treatment. The author is highlighting that inconsistency. If the gym charges the same rate for both, but offers different access based on sex, that could be considered discriminatory if it's not reciprocal. However, some places might argue that women-only spaces are necessary for their comfort and safety, which is a common argument in such contexts.\n\nBut the key here is whether the gym's policy is fair and equal. The author is saying it's not, because he can't access all areas if he's a man. The girlfriend's response is that it's different for women, implying that it's okay for women to have exclusive areas while men don't. That seems like a point of contention. The author is questioning the logic of why it's acceptable for women to have a restricted area that men can't use, but not the other way around.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, women-only spaces are often justified as promoting inclusivity and safety, especially in environments where women might feel uncomfortable. However, if the same gym doesn't offer a men-only section, then the author is facing a situation where his access is limited based on his gender. That's a form of discrimination if the restrictions aren't mutual.\n\nSo, the author is pointing out a potential inconsistency in the gym's policy. If the gym allows women to have a section without men but doesn't offer the same to men, it's a one-way restriction. The author is objecting to being treated differently because of his sex, which is a valid concern. His girlfriend's response that it's different for women might be dismissing his valid point about the lack of reciprocity.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for raising this issue. He's identifying a potential sexist policy, even if the intention behind the women-only section is to support women. The problem is that it creates an unequal access situation for men without a similar provision. The girlfriend might not see it as an issue because she benefits from the women-only space, but the author is correctly pointing out the double standard.\n"
