Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA) for not wanting to go to their girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. The key points here are the gym's policy and the person's reasoning.\n\nThe gym charges the same fee for everyone but has a section that's only for women. The author is upset because they feel it's unfair that they would pay the same price but not have access to all the equipment. Their girlfriend defends the policy, saying \"it's different for women.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of gender segregation in facilities. In many cases, women-only spaces are created to address historical inequalities and provide a safer environment for women, especially in settings where harassment might be an issue. These spaces can be important for encouraging female participation in activities where they might otherwise feel uncomfortable. \n\nHowever, from the author's perspective, it seems like they see this as discriminatory in the opposite direction. They argue that if they pay the same fee, they should have access to the entire facility. The girlfriend's response that \"it's different for women\" might be rooted in the understanding that such spaces aim to correct past imbalances and offer benefits that aren't immediately apparent to someone not facing the same challenges.\n\nThe question is whether the author's stance is valid. The author isn't being sexist themselves; they're pointing out a perceived inconsistency. But their reasoning might overlook the reasons why women-only spaces exist. The girlfriend's frustration comes from the author not understanding the necessity of such sections, which could be seen as a failure to empathize with her perspective.\n\nOn one hand, the author is correct that equal access is important. On the other hand, the women-only section serves a purpose for the women who use it. The author might not be wrong, but they might be missing the deeper social context. The situation could be more about differing values and understanding rather than outright being an asshole. \n\nHowever, the term \"asshole\" here refers to someone who is inconsiderate or disrespectful. The author is expressing a legitimate concern about fairness, even if they don't grasp the other side's reasoning. The girlfriend's response was dismissive, which might indicate she's not open to dialogue. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're highlighting an issue of fairness, and while they might not fully understand the rationale behind the women-only section, their perspective is valid. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from frustration that the author isn't acknowledging the importance of such spaces. So, the answer would likely be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
