Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for not wanting to go to their girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. The main issue here is the author's objection to the gym's policy of charging the same fee but restricting access to certain areas based on sex.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author and their girlfriend both work out and have been at different gyms. The girlfriend wants to switch to her gym for convenience reasons like carpooling and working out together. The author's main concern is the \"women only\" section, which they view as sexist because they would have to pay the same fee but can't use all the equipment. The girlfriend is upset and thinks the author is being unreasonable.\n\nNow, considering the concept of sexism, the author is pointing out a policy that seems discriminatory. If the gym charges everyone the same but provides less access to men (since the women-only section is 1/4 of the gym and equipment), that could be seen as unequal treatment. The author is drawing a parallel: if the roles were reversed, would the girlfriend accept being restricted? The girlfriend's response is dismissive, saying it's different for women.\n\nLegally, in many places, gender-based restrictions can be discriminatory. For example, in the U.S., Title IX prohibits sex discrimination in educational programs and activities that receive federal funding, but gyms aren't covered by Title IX. However, some states have laws against gender discrimination in public accommodations. So, depending on jurisdiction, the gym's policy might be illegal. But even if not illegal, it's a social and ethical issue.\n\nThe author's stance is about fairness and equality. They're not okay with a policy that seems to favor one gender over another. The girlfriend's reaction that it's \"different for women\" might stem from a belief that women need safe spaces to work out without harassment or discomfort. That's a valid point too; some women prefer all-women areas to avoid feeling objectified or for safety reasons. However, the author's issue is that men are being excluded from a portion of the facility without a clear justification beyond traditional gender roles.\n\nThe key here is whether the gym's policy is justified. If the women-only section is for safety or comfort, that's a valid reason. But if it's just a way to segregate without a legitimate purpose, it might be problematic. The author is challenging the policy's fairness, especially since it affects them directly by limiting their access. The girlfriend's frustration might come from feeling that the author isn't considering the reasons behind the policy or the benefits it provides to women.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? The author is not wrong for pointing out potential inequality. They're highlighting a discrepancy in treatment. The girlfriend is not wrong for needing a safe space, but her dismissal of the author's concerns as \"stupid\" is where the conflict arises. The author is justified in their stance because they're advocating for equal treatment, even if the policy is intended to help women. The girlfriend's refusal to see the author's perspective and her emotionally charged response (\"you're stupid\") suggest her response is more about defensiveness than understanding.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
