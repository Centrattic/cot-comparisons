Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to go to the same gym as his girlfriend because it has a women-only section. The author argues that the gym charges the same fee for everyone but restricts access to 75% of the equipment based on gender. His girlfriend thinks he's being silly, and when he asked if she would accept the same treatment, she got upset and said \"it's different for women.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue. The author is upset about the unequal access to equipment based on gender. He sees it as sexist because men are excluded from the women-only section, which takes up a quarter of the gym. His girlfriend doesn't see it the same way and thinks it's different for women. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for his stance.\n\nI should consider the concept of gender-based segregation in facilities. Some places have women-only sections for safety or comfort reasons, especially in areas where women might feel unsafe. For example, in countries with high rates of harassment, women-only spaces can be important. However, in this context, the author is in a gym where the women-only section is a part of the facility, not a safety measure. The gym charges the same fee regardless of gender but offers less equipment for men. That seems like a double standard from the author's perspective.\n\nThe author is drawing a parallel: if the gym charged men the same but restricted their access to a portion of the equipment, it would be seen as discriminatory. By that logic, the same should apply to women. His girlfriend's reaction suggests she doesn't view it the same way, possibly because she benefits from the women-only section. The author is challenging the inconsistency, which could be a valid point if the gym's policy is indeed discriminatory.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a cultural or social context I'm missing. In some societies, women-only gyms or sections are common, especially where there's a lack of gender equality. If this is such a context, the author's girlfriend might see the women-only section as a positive thing, providing a safe space or community. However, the author's argument is about equal access for all members. The gym's policy of allowing women to use a portion exclusively while men can't access that same portion, yet both pay the same, could be seen as unfair treatment towards men.\n\nAnother angle: the author is trying to apply the same standard to both genders. If the gym allows one gender to exclude the other, it's a form of discrimination. The girlfriend's response that \"it's different for women\" could be based on historical or societal reasons where women have been marginalized, so creating spaces for women is necessary. But the author is pointing out the inconsistency in the treatment, which might be a valid critique of the gym's policy rather than the girlfriend's position.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author is challenging a policy that he believes is discriminatory, he's standing up for equal treatment. However, if the women-only section is intended to address existing inequalities or provide a safe space for women, then the author's argument might overlook those considerations. The key is whether the gym's policy is a legitimate accommodation or a form of discrimination.\n\nIn legal terms, in many countries, gender-based restrictions can be considered discriminatory unless based on legitimate reasons. If the gym is offering an area that's exclusively for women, that could be seen as violating anti-discrimination laws, depending on the jurisdiction. But if the women-only section is for safety or cultural reasons, it might be allowed. Without knowing the specific laws, it's hard to say, but the author's point about equal access is a valid one.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction that she doesn't understand might indicate a lack of empathy or awareness of the implications of her gym's policy. The author is pointing out the inconsistency, which could be a reasonable critique. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for pointing this out. He's advocating for equal treatment, which is a valid stance.\n"
