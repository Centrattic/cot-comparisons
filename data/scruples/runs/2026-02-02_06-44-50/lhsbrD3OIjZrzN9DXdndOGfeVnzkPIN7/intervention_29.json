Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is upset about joining their girlfriend's gym that has a women-only section. They argue that since the gym charges everyone the same but restricts access based on gender, it's sexist. The girlfriend thinks the author doesn't understand and that it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of gendered spaces. Women-only sections in gyms can serve to create safe spaces where women might feel more comfortable, especially in areas where they might feel outnumbered or uncomfortable. This isn't necessarily about exclusion but about inclusivity and safety. So, from the girlfriend's perspective, the women-only section isn't meant to exclude men but to provide a specific need for women.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is pointing out a perceived inequality: paying full price for partial access. If the gym charges the same fee regardless of which section you use, it could be seen as unfair if part of the facility is off-limits due to gender. However, the existence of a women-only section might be a response to societal issues where women feel unsafe in mixed environments. So, the gym might be trying to address those concerns, even if it leads to some inequality in access for men.\n\nThe author's analogy of asking the girlfriend if she'd accept being restricted is a fair point. If the roles were reversed, the girlfriend might find it objectionable, which highlights the inconsistency. However, the argument that \"it's different for women\" points to real societal differences in how genders experience spaces. The author might be failing to recognize that these differences are based on historical and ongoing gender disparities.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're pointing out a logical inconsistency, but they might not be considering the underlying reasons for the separate section. The girlfriend's frustration comes from the fact that the women-only section serves a purpose beyond just physical separation. The author's approach could be seen as dismissing her valid concerns. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not understanding the context and intent behind the women-only section. However, the gym's policy itself could be problematic if it's not transparent or if it's truly discriminatory without a valid reason. But given the scenario, the author's stance seems to miss the rationale behind the policy, so they might be in the wrong.\n"
