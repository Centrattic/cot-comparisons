Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to switch to their girlfriend's gym because of the \"women only\" section.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Both the author and his girlfriend work out at different gyms. She suggests he move to her gym for convenience, but he's objecting because her gym has a section exclusively for women. The author's main argument is that since the gym charges the same for everyone, but restricts men from using a quarter of the equipment, it's sexist. He compares it to if a gym charged women the same but restricted their access.\n\nNow, the girlfriend thinks he's being stupid and says it's different for women. The author is confused and feels his reasoning is valid, while his girlfriend is upset and isn't seeing his point.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's analyze. The key issue is gender-segregated spaces in gyms. In many places, such as the US, gyms can have women-only sections if they choose. These areas are often created to accommodate women who may feel uncomfortable in co-ed environments. However, the author is arguing that it's unfair because men are being excluded from part of the facility without a difference in price.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, as long as the gym isn't violating anti-discrimination laws (which vary by location), they can have such sections. The author's grievance is more about the principle of equal access for the same price. But does that make him in the wrong? The girlfriend is saying it's different for women, which might be because she values the women-only section for her comfort and safety. \n\nThe author is trying to understand her perspective but is also standing by his belief that it's a form of sexism. Is his stance valid? It could be seen as him not understanding the purpose behind the women-only sections. However, his argument is based on the fairness of paying full price for less access, which is a logical point. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's frustration is that he's not grasping the societal context where such sections exist to address women's needs. So, it's a clash of perspectives. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to support a policy he deems sexist, even if there's a good intention behind the women-only area.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a nuanced issue. The author isn't necessarily wrong for having that opinion. However, the conflict arises from differing views on gender equity and space allocation. The girlfriend might feel that the author is dismissing her needs without understanding the rationale for the women-only section. \n\nSo, the author's position is based on a fair point about access and pricing, but his approach might have been confrontational (by asking her if she would accept the reverse), which could have escalated the situation. The girlfriend's reaction might be because she feels her needs are being invalidated. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for having a valid argument, but the situation is more about a mismatch in understanding each other's perspectives rather than a clear right or wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
