Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the story is wrong for not wanting to join their girlfriend's gym because of the women-only section. The main issue is the gym having a section that's only for women, which the author finds sexist. \n\nSo, the gym charges the same fee for everyone, but the women-only section takes up 25% of the space and equipment. The author argues that if a man were charged the same but couldn't use that 25%, it would be unfair. The girlfriend thinks it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of gender-segregated spaces. In some contexts, like locker rooms or certain sports, gender segregation is common and accepted because of privacy or safety concerns. But in a gym setting, is a women-only area justifiable? If the gym allows women to have their own space without extra cost, maybe it's intended to make them feel more comfortable. But the author's issue is that he's paying the same but can't access all the facilities. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the gym is charging the same price but restricting access based on gender, that could be seen as discriminatory against men. But the justification for the women-only section might be to provide a safe or welcoming environment for women, which is a different kind of equity. However, if the policy is that the women-only section is available to women without any additional cost, but men are excluded from it, then men are effectively paying for a service (full access) they don't receive. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument is that it's different for women. This could imply that she sees the women-only section as a necessary privilege or a way to address historical underrepresentation in gyms. But the author is pointing out the inconsistency: if the gym charges everyone the same but restricts part of the facility based on gender, that's a form of discrimination. \n\nThe key here is whether the gym's policy is justifiable. If the women-only section is there to promote inclusivity and safety for women, then maybe it's a form of affirmative action. But if it's creating an unequal experience for non-women members, that's a problem. The author is highlighting that by paying the same, they should have the same access. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is that the author is being \"stupid\" and not understanding. Her defensiveness might stem from feeling that the women-only section is a necessary privilege for women. But the author's argument is about equal access for equal price, which is a valid point. \n\nIn terms of fairness and equality, the author is pointing out a potential inconsistency in the gym's policy. If the gym is providing the same fee but different access, that's a form of discrimination. However, the context of why the women-only section exists is important. If it's for safety or comfort, maybe it's a form of positive discrimination. But if the gym's policy is not justifiable, then the author's stance is valid. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're highlighting a potential issue with the gym's policy. The girlfriend might be defending a policy she believes is necessary, but the author's perspective is about equal treatment. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
