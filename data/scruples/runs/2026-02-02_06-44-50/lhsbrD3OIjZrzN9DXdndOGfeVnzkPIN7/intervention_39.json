Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch to his girlfriend's gym because of the women-only section.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the author's objection to the gym's policy. The gym charges the same fee for everyone but has a section that's exclusively for women. The author argues it's sexist because men can't access that part, so they effectively pay for less access. His girlfriend defends the policy as being different for women.\n\nI need to consider if the author's stance is valid. The key here is the concept of separate facilities and whether they constitute discrimination. In many places, single-sex facilities are allowed under anti-discrimination laws, especially if they serve specific needs, like women-only spaces for safety or community. However, if the gym is charging the same fee but limiting access based on gender without offering equivalent alternatives, that could be problematic.\n\nBut the author is comparing his situation to how women would feel if the reverse happened. His girlfriend's argument is that it's different for women, implying that the women-only section addresses issues women face, like harassment or confidence. The author is challenging the fairness of such a policy by asking if she'd accept the same for men. \n\nThe author is pointing out a perceived inconsistency. If the gym allows women-only spaces but doesn't offer similar men-only spaces, it could be seen as favoring women. However, the presence of a women-only section isn't inherently sexist; it's about intent and impact. If the gym is providing equal overall access (like other sections for all), then it's a matter of personal preference and values.\n\nThe author's refusal to switch gyms is a personal choice, but the argument about fairness might not hold if the gym's policy is intended to support women. However, the author's logic is that if the policy is applied equally in reverse, it would be considered sexist. His girlfriend's frustration comes from perceiving his argument as invalidating her experience.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on perspective. If the gym's policy is legitimate and the author is being inflexible, he might be. But if the policy is discriminatory, he's justified. However, in many contexts, women-only spaces are protected, so the author's stance might stem from misunderstanding. Thus, he might be in the wrong for not recognizing the rationale behind the policy and for not compromising.\n"
