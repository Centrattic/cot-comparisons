Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because the gym has a women-only section. The author's main issue is that the gym charges the same fee for everyone but restricts certain areas and equipment based on gender. The girlfriend thinks it's different for women and the author is being too literal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the situation. If a gym charges the same price but limits access to certain facilities based on gender, that seems like a discriminatory practice. The author is pointing out a logical inconsistency here. If you pay the same amount, you should have access to all the facilities. Restricting access based on gender, even if it's marketed as a positive feature for women, still creates an unequal experience for others.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might see the women-only section as empowering or a safe space. But the author's objection isn't about the existence of such a space; it's about the unequal access for men paying the same fee. The author is drawing a parallel: if a gym had a section for men only and charged women the same but prevented them from using it, that would be clearly discriminatory. So why is it acceptable in reverse?\n\nThe girlfriend's response that the author is \"not understanding\" suggests a lack of empathy on her part, but the author's point is about fairness and equal access. The author isn't opposing the women-only section per se, but the unequal treatment in access for the same price. That's a valid concern. The gym's policy does create a disparity, regardless of intent. So the author isn't being unreasonable here. The girlfriend might not see the issue because she benefits from the women-only section, but the author's argument is about the principle of equal access. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; the gym's policy is the issue, not the author's stance.\n"
