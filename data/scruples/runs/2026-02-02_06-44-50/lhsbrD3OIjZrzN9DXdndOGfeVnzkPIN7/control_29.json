Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to switch to their girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. The key points here are about equality and perception.\n\nThe author's main argument is that the gym charges both genders the same fee but restricts access to 25% of the equipment and area for men. They see this as sexist, which is a valid concern about fairness. The girlfriend, on the other hand, seems to accept the women-only section as a positive thing, possibly for reasons like creating a safe space or promoting women's fitness, which she might argue is justified even if it means men can't use that part.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is an asshole here. From a logical standpoint, the author is pointing out a potential inequity. If the gym offers a section exclusive to one gender, that's a form of discrimination, even if it's well-intentioned. The girlfriend's response that it's \"different for women\" might stem from a belief in the necessity of such spaces for women's comfort or empowerment, but that doesn't negate the author's valid point about equal access for members paying the same price.\n\nHowever, relationships often involve compromise. The author is standing by their principles, but the girlfriend might feel that the women's section is important for her. The question is whether the author's stance is unreasonable. Since the gym's policy is inherently discriminatory (if it's charging everyone the same but restricting access based on sex), the author isn't necessarily wrong. But the situation might require negotiation, like finding a gym without such sections or adjusting their workout routines differently.\n\nSo, considering the principles of equality and the situation's context, the author is not in the wrong for objecting to a policy that limits access based on gender. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
