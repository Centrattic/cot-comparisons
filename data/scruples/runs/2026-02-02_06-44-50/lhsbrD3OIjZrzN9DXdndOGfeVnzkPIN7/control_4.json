Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the woman wants her partner to switch to her gym, but the gym has a women-only section. The man objects because he feels it's sexist that men can't access that part, even though they pay the same fee. His girlfriend thinks he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of single-gender spaces in gyms. There are gyms that have women-only areas for various reasons, like feeling more comfortable or safe. But the key here is whether it's discriminatory. The man argues that paying the same fee but getting access to only 75% of the equipment is unfair. But the woman counters that it's different for women. \n\nSo, is this a case of the man being reasonable or not? The question is whether his objection is valid. On one hand, if the gym offers a service that he can't access despite paying the same, that could be seen as unequal treatment. But the gym might justify the women-only section as a choice, not discrimination. However, in many places, laws require equal access unless there's a specific, legitimate reason. But gyms often have exceptions for single-gender spaces if they're optional. \n\nThe man's argument is that he's being excluded from part of the facility he's paying for. However, if the gym allows voluntary segregation (like women-only hours or sections), then maybe it's within their rights. The problem is whether this segregation is discriminatory. In some legal contexts, allowing single-gender spaces isn't illegal if they're optional and not enforced. However, if the gym is a public place, there might be different regulations. \n\nThe man is also arguing from a fairness perspective. If women can choose to have a women-only space, why can't he have the same? But maybe the purpose of such spaces is to accommodate women's needs, which might not be the same for men. However, the man is not being excluded from the entire gym, just a section. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests she doesn't see the issue, thinking it's different for women. This could be a case of misunderstanding or differing perspectives. The man is asking if he's the asshole, which implies he's trying to see if his stance is unreasonable. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. The man's concern about fairness might be valid, but the gym's policy might be considered acceptable. However, if the gym is charging the same for less access to men, that could be a problem. But if the women-only section is optional and not enforced, then the gym is allowed to have it. \n\nSo, if the gym is not violating any anti-discrimination laws, then the man's objection might be based on a personal belief rather than a legal wrong. In that case, maybe he's not in the wrong for having that opinion, but expecting his girlfriend to understand might be challenging if she doesn't see it the same way. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong because his objection is about perceived unfairness, but it's a matter of perspective. However, if the gym's policy is legal and allowed, then he might not be in the wrong for objecting, but the girlfriend's perspective is also valid. So the correct answer is B (No).\n"
