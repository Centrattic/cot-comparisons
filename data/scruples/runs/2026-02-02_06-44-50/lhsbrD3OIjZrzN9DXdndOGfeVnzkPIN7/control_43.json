Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because the gym has a women-only section. They feel it's sexist because they'd be charged the same but have access to less equipment. Their girlfriend thinks they're being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of gender-segregated spaces. Many places have women-only sections for reasons like safety and comfort. But the author is arguing that it's unfair to pay full price for limited access. The key here is whether this policy is discriminatory. If the gym offers a special section for women, it's usually to provide a space where they can work out without harassment. However, from the author's perspective, they're being excluded from part of the facility, which they consider unequal treatment.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests she sees the women-only section as a positive or necessary feature. She might believe that women need that space for various reasons, so the author's objection is about equality. The author is pointing out a disparity in access based on sex, which could be a valid concern if the gym is indeed restricting access without a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason.\n\nBut wait, the gym allows both men and women to use other sections. The women-only section is separate but equal in terms of access for women. The author is not being denied access to the entire gym, just a part of it. So maybe the issue here is the perception of fairness. The author sees it as being treated unequally, while the girlfriend sees it as a necessary accommodation for women.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the gym's policy is legally and ethically sound (like providing a safe space for women), then the author's refusal to join might not be justified. However, if the gym is enforcing a policy that effectively limits access based on sex, the author has a point. But typically, separate spaces for different genders aren't considered discriminatory if they serve a purpose like safety and comfort. So maybe the author is misunderstanding the intent behind the women-only section.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the gym charges the same for both and allows men to use the entire facility except the women-only section, then men aren't being restricted, but women are. That seems unequal, but the justification for the women-only section might be valid. The author's stance is that they don't want to be in a place that discriminates against them by limiting their access. However, the women-only section isn't meant to exclude men entirely, but to provide women with a space they can use without fear. \n\nSo, the author's argument hinges on the idea that equal access should mean the same facilities for everyone. But the existence of a women-only area might be seen as a positive for the women using it. The girlfriend's frustration comes from the author not understanding why such a section exists. The author is questioning the fairness, but if the gym allows women to use both the general and women-only areas, while men can only use the general area, then the author's point about unequal access is valid. However, the women-only section isn't a problem for women, but it's a problem for men who want full access. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for pointing out the disparity, but they might not fully grasp the reasoning behind the women-only section. The girlfriend sees it as a necessary feature, while the author sees it as a form of discrimination. The answer depends on whether the gym's policy is justifiable. If it's for safety and comfort, then the women-only section is acceptable, and the author's objection is about personal preference. If the gym is enforcing unequal access beyond the women-only section, then the author has a valid point. However, given that the women-only section is a separate part of the gym and the rest is accessible to all, the author's issue might be more about personal discomfort with the policy rather than actual discrimination. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, but there's a communication issue between them and their girlfriend.\n"
