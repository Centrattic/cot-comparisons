Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the guy doesn't want to switch to his girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. The guy's reasoning is that it's sexist because men pay the same fee but can't use that section. The girlfriend is upset and says it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The woman's gym has a women-only section, which is a quarter of the area and equipment. The guy is against switching because he thinks it's unfair that men can't use that part, even though they pay the same. The girlfriend argues that it's different for women, which the guy doesn't understand.\n\nSo, is the guy in the wrong? Well, gender-segregated spaces can be tricky. On one hand, the gym is providing a space for women, which can be important for safety, comfort, or other reasons. Many gyms have such sections to cater to women who might feel more comfortable working out without men. But the guy is seeing this as unequal treatment because men can't access that part. But maybe the reason for the women-only section isn't about restricting men but about providing women with a choice. \n\nThe guy's argument is that paying the same fee but having less access is unfair. But if the gym allows women to use that section and men don't, is it really discriminatory? Or is it a matter of different needs? The woman might not see it as sexist because the policy is to support women's needs, not to restrict men. \n\nThe guy's comparison of asking if she'd go to a gym that banned women might be a good point, but if the scenario is reversed, maybe there's a different context. However, the key here is whether the policy is inherently sexist. If the gym is providing equal value for all members, considering that women have a dedicated space, maybe it's not unfair. Men can use the rest of the gym, which is three-quarters. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy is seeing it as a lack of equal access. But if the gym has different sections for different groups without a discriminatory intent, it's more about choice rather than inequality. However, the guy's perspective is that he's being treated unfairly, which is a valid concern. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the gym is providing equal value to all members, then the guy might be misunderstanding the purpose of the women's section. The girlfriend might be right in thinking that it's different for women, as they have a space that meets their specific needs. \n\nSo, maybe the guy is not in the wrong if he's uncomfortable with the policy, but the way he framed his argument (calling his girlfriend's stance as \"stupid\" and bringing up the comparison about women being restricted) might be where the issue lies. However, the core of the problem is his disagreement with the gym's policy. If the policy isn't inherently discriminatory, then his objection might be misplaced. \n\nBut I'm still a bit confused. The gym isn't charging women more to use their own section. If the women's section is part of the overall gym and everyone pays the same, maybe the guy is right to point out that men aren't getting the full value. But then again, maybe the gym's structure is designed to serve different groups without discrimination. \n\nHmm. Maybe the key here is whether the policy is discriminatory. If the gym is allowing women to have a space while not restricting men in any other way, it's not necessarily sexist. It's more about choice and inclusivity. The guy might not see it that way, but if the policy is intended to support women without disadvantaging men, he might be the one not understanding. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because he's expressing his discomfort with a policy he sees as unfair, but the girlfriend's gym might have a valid reason for the women-only section. However, if the policy is actually equitable, then the guy is overreacting. \n\nBut how to decide? It's tricky. The gym charges the same fee for everyone, but men can't use a quarter of the equipment. If the women's section is part of the gym, then maybe the gym is providing equal access overall. But the guy is not using the women's section, so he's only getting three-quarters of the gym. That could be seen as unequal. But maybe the gym allows that section for women as a service, and men can use the rest. So, it's not that they're being charged more, but they get to use less. \n\nIn that case, the guy is right to point out that if a gym restricts a group from using part of the facility, it's not fair. But if the women's section is a service provided to women, and men can use the rest, maybe it's not about discrimination. \n\nWait, but if the gym is providing the same services to all members, including the women's section as a benefit for women, then men aren't being excluded from any service. The women's section is an additional benefit for women, not a restriction on men. So the guy is paying for access to the entire gym, but the women's section is an extra benefit for women. \n\nIn that case, the guy isn't being treated unfairly because he can use the rest of the gym. The women are getting a bonus. So his argument is flawed because he's not being restricted from using the majority of the gym. The women's section is a separate benefit. So his objection is based on a misunderstanding. \n\nTherefore, the author is wrong in thinking it's sexist because the gym isn't restricting men from using the majority of the facility. The women's section is an added feature for women, not a restriction on men. So the author is the one not understanding, which makes him the asshole. \n\nSo the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
