Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend wants them to switch to her gym for convenience, but the gym has a women-only section. The author is upset because they feel it's sexist to pay full price but only have access to part of the gym. The girlfriend is frustrated that the author doesn't understand why the women-only section is acceptable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of gender-segregated spaces in gyms. Some gyms offer women-only areas for reasons like comfort, safety, or marketing. However, the key issue here is that the author is being charged the same fee but not getting access to all the equipment. If the gym charges everyone the same but restricts access based on gender, that could be seen as discriminatory. The author is pointing out an inconsistency: if you pay the same as someone else, you should get the same access. But the girlfriend seems to accept that women can have their own section, implying that the author's objection is about something that's just part of the gym's policy and not inherently wrong.\n\nBut wait, is it fair for the gym to do that? In many places, laws require equal access unless there's a specific exemption, like religious institutions or certain types of spaces. However, a commercial gym might have the right to create such sections if they're willing to charge accordingly. But if they charge the same and exclude part of the facility based on gender, that might not be legal, depending on local anti-discrimination laws. For example, in the US, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits gender discrimination in public accommodations. If the gym is a public place, then gender-based restrictions could be illegal unless they're a religious or similar institution.\n\nBut the girlfriend's perspective is that it's \"different for women.\" This suggests she sees the women-only section as a positive, maybe for empowerment or safety. However, the author is arguing from a standpoint of equal treatment. If the gym allows such a section but charges men the same, that's a problem. The author isn't opposing the women-only section itself, but rather the unequal access when paying the same. The girlfriend's reaction seems dismissive, calling the author \"stupid\" and not understanding, which might indicate a lack of empathy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not be considering the reasons why the women-only section exists. Maybe the gym offers it for specific reasons, and the author isn't trying to engage with her perspective. The question is whether the author is wrong to prioritize equal access over her convenience. If the gym's policy is discriminatory, then the author is right to object. If it's a legitimate service offering, then the author might be overreacting.\n\nBut the crux is the author's argument about equal payment for equal access. If the gym charges everyone the same but restricts part of the facility by gender, that's unequal treatment. So the author is pointing out a problem with the gym's policy, not with the girlfriend's preference. The girlfriend's response is dismissive, which might mean she's not considering the validity of the author's concern. In that case, the author isn't the asshole; the gym might be at fault for the policy, and the girlfriend isn't supporting her partner's valid concern.\n"
