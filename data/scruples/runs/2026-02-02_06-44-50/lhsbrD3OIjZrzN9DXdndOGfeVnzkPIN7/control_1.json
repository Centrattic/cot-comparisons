Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The key points here are about gender equality and the gym's policy.\n\nSo the author's girlfriend suggested they go to the same gym, which has a women-only section. The author objects because he feels it's sexist\u2014charging the same fee but restricting access based on gender. He compares it to if she were charged the same but couldn't use part of the gym. She got upset and said it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of gender equality. Both genders should have equal access to facilities, right? If the gym is allowing women-only access to a portion, maybe that's a form of segregation. But wait, maybe the women-only section is intended to create a safe space where women can work out without feeling uncomfortable or objectified by men. That's a common argument in favor of such spaces. However, the problem here is that the gym charges men the same fee but restricts their access to 75% of the equipment. If that's the case, it's a discrepancy in access based on gender, which is indeed a form of discrimination.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is that if he's paying the same, he should have access to all areas. His girlfriend argues that it's different for women, implying that the women-only section serves a purpose. However, the author's objection is valid because it's about equal treatment. If the gym allows a women-only section, that's one thing, but if men are excluded from that same area without a reciprocal arrangement, it's unequal. \n\nWait, but maybe the women-only section is a special offer, and the gym is still providing all the standard equipment in the remaining areas. The author is arguing that by not allowing men into the women-only section, they're effectively being restricted. But if the gym's other areas are open to everyone, then maybe the author is still getting access to most of the facilities. However, the problem is that the author isn't being given the same access as women. If the gym had a men-only section that women couldn't access, but charged women the same, would that be acceptable? Probably not. So the principle here is about equal access based on gender. \n\nThe author is pointing out a double standard. The gym has a policy that allows women to use a certain area without restriction, but men are barred from it. If the author is paying the same fee, he should have the same access. The girlfriend's response that \"it's different for women\" might be a form of defensiveness, not addressing the actual issue of unequal access. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't being the asshole here. He's raising a valid concern about gender-based restrictions leading to unequal treatment. The girlfriend's gym policy is the root of the problem, not the author's objection. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
