Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully. \n\nThe user is asking if the person who wrote the post is wrong for not wanting to go to the same gym as their girlfriend because they think it's sexist. The girlfriend suggested switching gyms to carpool and work out together, but the author is against it because the gym has a women-only section. The gym charges the same fee for everyone, but the women-only section takes up a quarter of the gym and equipment. The author argues that it's unfair that men have to pay the same fee but can't use that section. The girlfriend is upset and says the author is being stupid, and that it's different for women. The author is confused and wants to know if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The gym has a women-only section, which reduces the available equipment for men by 25%. The author is paying the same fee as women but can't access that section. The author is objecting on the grounds of sexism, while the girlfriend is defending it as being different for women. \n\nNow, I should think about the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, having a women-only section in a gym might be considered discriminatory against men. For example, in Canada, there was a case where a women-only section in a gym was ruled to be discriminatory under human rights laws. Similarly, in the US, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on sex in places of public accommodation, so a gym that's open to the public can't exclude men from a section if they're charging the same fee. However, there might be exceptions for certain religious or cultural reasons, but this seems like a general case. \n\nThe author's argument is that it's unfair to pay the same fee but have access to less equipment. The girlfriend's response that it's different for women might stem from the idea that such sections are intended to create a safe space for women, especially in environments where they might feel uncomfortable working out around men. However, the existence of such a section could be seen as a form of segregation, which is inherently discriminatory. \n\nThe author is not being unreasonable in pointing out the inconsistency in the gym's policy. If the gym is charging everyone the same price but limiting access to resources based on gender, that's a form of sex discrimination. The girlfriend's reaction that the author is being stupid might be because she sees the women-only section as empowering for women, not as discriminatory against men. However, that doesn't negate the author's perspective. It's possible that both are coming from different points of view, but the author is correct in identifying a potential discrimination issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the women-only section serves a purpose, such as providing a space where women can work out without harassment or judgment. But from a legal standpoint, if the gym is public and charges the same fee, then gender-based restrictions could be illegal. Therefore, the author's stance isn't baseless. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out what appears to be a discriminatory policy. The girlfriend's response might be dismissive, but the author is raising a valid concern. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
