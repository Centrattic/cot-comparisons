Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to switch to his girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: Both he and his girlfriend go to different gyms. She suggests he switch to hers for convenience. The issue is the women-only section. The gym charges the same fee but restricts access to part of the facility based on gender. The author argues it's sexist because men pay full price but can't use all the equipment. His girlfriend seems to think it's different for women, maybe because she finds the women-only area beneficial, perhaps for feeling safer or avoiding harassment.\n\nNow, the key points here. The gym allows women to have a dedicated space, which can be important for some. But by charging everyone the same, they're effectively giving men less value for their money. The author is pointing out a potential inconsistency: if he can't use part of the gym, why pay full price? His girlfriend might feel that the women-only section addresses her needs, which could be valid. However, his argument isn't about wanting access to the women-only area but about equal access for all paying members.\n\nIs this a case of not understanding? He's trying to highlight the inequity from his perspective. But his girlfriend might see the women-only section as necessary for her comfort, which is also valid. The conflict arises from differing values\u2014gender equality vs. specific needs for women. \n\nLegally, in many places, single-sex facilities are allowed if both genders have access to other areas. But the ethical question is about pricing. If the gym charges the same despite different access, it's a fairness issue. The author's stance is about equal treatment for equal cost. His girlfriend might not see it as denying him access but as providing a space she needs, which is a different perspective.\n\nSo, is he the asshole? He's standing up for his belief in equal treatment, which is reasonable. His girlfriend might feel he's not acknowledging the importance of the women-only space. But the core issue is the pricing model. If the gym charged more for access to the entire facility, his argument might be weaker. But since the price is the same, he's pointing out a discrepancy. \n\nI think the answer is B\u2014the author isn't in the wrong. He's raising a valid point about equal access relative to payment. The girlfriend's upset might stem from not seeing the pricing inequity, but that's a communication issue, not necessarily his fault. It's a matter of differing priorities, but not inherently wrong on his part.\n"
