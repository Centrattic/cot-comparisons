Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not wanting to switch to their girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. The main issue is whether the gym's policy is sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The gym charges the same fee for everyone but has a section that men can't access. The user argues that this is unfair because men pay the same but can't use all the equipment. The girlfriend suggests it's different for women, which the user finds confusing.\n\nSo, the key points are: equal pricing but restricted access based on gender. The user sees this as sexist. The girlfriend defends it, saying it's different for women. The user is being called \"stupid\" for this stance.\n\nGym policies with women-only sections can be controversial. They might exist to create a space where women feel safe, especially in industries where women might feel uncomfortable in mixed-gender environments. However, from the user's perspective, if they're paying the same, they might feel it's discriminatory to exclude them from part of the facility.\n\nBut is the user wrong for not wanting to go there? The user's argument is based on equality\u2014paying the same but not having equal access. The girlfriend's response is that it's different for women. The user is pointing out the inconsistency in the policy, which is valid from an equality standpoint. However, the gym's policy might aim to address different needs for women, which could be a separate issue.\n\nIs it sexist? If the gym is providing equal value for the money, maybe not. If a woman pays the same but can use the entire gym, that's different. But in this case, the gym charges the same but restricts access to a portion for women only. That could be seen as giving women more access for the same price, which the user might find unfair. But if the gym is designed to accommodate women's specific needs (like women-only sections for safety or comfort), then it's a different angle.\n\nThe user is challenging the policy as sexist, which is a valid perspective. The girlfriend's reaction might be that she doesn't see the issue. The user is questioning the fairness, which is a legitimate concern. So, is the user in the wrong? If the policy is about creating inclusive spaces for women, maybe not. But from the user's point of view, equal access for equal price is a fair argument.\n\nIn terms of the relationship, the user is trying to communicate their discomfort with the policy. The girlfriend is upset and dismissive. The user's position is based on a principle of fairness. Unless the gym's policy is legally mandated or has a valid reason beyond just gender, the user's stance isn't necessarily wrong. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
