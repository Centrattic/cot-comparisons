Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is the asshole here (AITA), specifically whether they're in the wrong for not wanting to join their girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Both the author and his girlfriend work out at different gyms. She wants him to switch to her gym so they can carpool and work out together. The issue is that her gym has a women-only section that takes up a quarter of the gym's area and equipment. The author feels it's sexist because men are charged the same fee but can't use that section, which he compares to charging women the same but restricting them from using a lot of equipment. His girlfriend gets upset and says it's different for women, and he's wondering if he's wrong.\n\nSo, the core of the conflict is about gender-based restrictions. The author is objecting to the gym's policy of having a women-only section, which he sees as discriminatory because it limits access based on sex. His argument is that if women were charged the same but couldn't use certain equipment, that would be unfair, so the reverse should also be considered unfair. His girlfriend, however, thinks it's different for women, which could imply she sees the women-only section as beneficial or necessary, maybe for safety or other reasons.\n\nNow, considering the question of whether the author is in the wrong. If the gym is legally allowed to have a women-only section, then from a legal standpoint, there's no violation. However, the ethical side is more nuanced. The author's reasoning is based on the principle of equality\u2014why should one gender be restricted while the other isn't, especially when they pay the same. But his girlfriend might argue that women-only sections can be safe spaces for women, which is a common argument in favor of such spaces. However, the author is not being allowed to access that section, which could be seen as exclusionary, but he's still allowed to use the rest of the gym. \n\nThe author is drawing a parallel between his situation and what women might face in a gym without such sections. His comparison might be a bit of a hypothetical, but it's a way to highlight the inconsistency. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she doesn't see the issue from his perspective, possibly because she perceives the women-only section as a positive feature for women, not a negative for men.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, if he's advocating for equal access and seeing the policy as discriminatory, that's a valid concern. However, if the gym's policy is in place to provide safe spaces for women, then the author's objection might not be about discrimination but about his discomfort with the existing policy. The key here is whether the policy is inherently sexist. If the gym were to say \"men can't use certain areas,\" that would be discriminatory, but the author is being excluded from the women-only section, which is a different scenario. \n\nThe author is not being denied access to the entire gym; he can still use three-quarters of it. So maybe his objection is more about the principle of gender-based restrictions rather than actual exclusion. His girlfriend's gym's policy is a common practice in some gyms, where women-only hours or sections exist to encourage female participation. But the author is not okay with that because it creates a disparity in access between genders.\n\nIn terms of being the asshole, if the author is trying to have a discussion about equality and is pointing out a potential inconsistency in the policy, that's not inherently wrong. However, if he's refusing to compromise or understand his girlfriend's perspective (maybe she values the women-only section for valid reasons), then it could be seen as inflexible. But the situation is that he's explaining his reasoning, which is based on the idea that the policy is discriminatory. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's stance is justified. If the policy is a form of discrimination, then he's right. If it's a necessary accommodation for women, then his objection is less valid. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the policy is legal and intended to promote women's participation, then the author might be in the wrong for objecting to it. However, if he's arguing that the policy is discriminatory because it restricts based on sex, then he's standing on a principle of equality. \n\nIn many societies, having single-sex spaces is considered acceptable, especially if they are meant to create safer environments for women. For example, in some places, women-only transportation or sections in public transport exist for similar reasons. So, the gym's policy might be seen as a way to encourage more women to use the gym, thereby increasing their overall participation. In that case, the author's objection could be viewed as not understanding the purpose and being overly focused on equal access rather than considering the intent behind the policy.\n\nTherefore, the author might be considered in the wrong if he's not acknowledging the reasons behind the women-only section and is instead focusing on the disparity in access. His comparison might not be fair if the policy is meant to address historical inequalities and not to discriminate against men. However, if the policy is indeed discriminatory (e.g., charging men the same but restricting their use), then the author has a point. But given that the policy is a common practice and often seen as a way to support women, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for not understanding the context and the intention behind the policy.\n"
