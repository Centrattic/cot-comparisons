Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple who both like working out but have been going to different gyms. The girlfriend suggests they switch to the same gym for carpooling and working out together. The author objects because the gym has a \"women only\" section that takes up a quarter of the facility and equipment. He argues that since the fee is the same, it's unfair for him to pay full price but only have access to 75% of the gym.\n\nHmm, first, I need to understand the core of the issue. The author is uncomfortable because the gym has a section exclusively for women. His main point is that he's not getting the full value for his money. But the girlfriend is upset and says \"it's different for women.\" So what's the difference here?\n\nWell, the \"women only\" section is likely a space where women can work out without the presence of men, which is intended to make them feel more comfortable or safe. That's a common feature in some gyms to address feelings of insecurity or harassment. The author is equating his situation to the hypothetical where women are charged the same but can't use some equipment, which sounds like a comparison to segregation. But in this case, the women's section is optional for the author. He can use the rest of the gym, while women can use both the general area and the women-only section. \n\nSo the author is being denied access to a specific part of the gym, but he's still free to use the majority (75%) of it. If he's not using the women-only section, he's not being excluded from the other areas. The key point here is that the gym is not segregating all members; it's just offering an additional area for women. Men are allowed in the general areas. \n\nThe author's argument is that he's paying the same but getting less access. But the women are getting more access, not the other way around. The comparison he makes is flawed because he's not in the same position as the women. Women can choose to use both sections, while men can only use the general one. So if he's not in the women-only area, he's still using 75% of the gym. That's not a problem for him, but he perceives it as unfair because he's paying for 100% access. \n\nHowever, the existence of a women-only section is a response to potential safety or comfort issues. It's a separate space, not a restriction on him. The girlfriend might be pointing out that for women, having that section is important, even if it's a smaller part of the gym. The author's objection is about equal access, but the gym isn't forcing him to use the women-only area. He's free to use the general areas where both men and women are present. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of saying he's being stupid and that it's different for women might stem from frustration, but the author's perspective is about fairness. The issue is whether it's sexist to object to a gym that offers a women-only section while charging the same fee. The author isn't being denied access to the rest of the gym, so maybe his objection is not based on actual exclusion but on a principle of equal access for both genders. \n\nWait, but if the gym charges the same for men and women, and the women can use both the general and women-only areas, while men can only use the general, then from the gym's perspective, it's splitting the space. But the author is not being restricted; he just can't use the women-only part. So he's paying for the entire gym but not for the women-only section. However, the fee is the same for both. If the gym is using part of the space for women-only, maybe the cost structure isn't directly tied to the space accessed. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's being charged equally but has less access. But that's a misunderstanding. The women-only area is an added benefit for women, not a reduction in what men receive. Men are still getting the full access to the general areas. The author is not being excluded from the main part of the gym, so his argument is about not wanting to pay for something he can't use. But the gym's pricing might be based on the total facility, not per section. \n\nIn terms of sexism, the women-only section is a way to provide a safe space for women, which is a positive and non-discriminatory action. The author is not being discriminated against in the same way. He can still use the majority of the gym. His objection is more about the value of his membership rather than gender-based discrimination. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong here. His concern is about perceived fairness in membership value, not about denying his girlfriend's needs. The girlfriend's resistance might be because she values the women-only section for her own comfort, and the author's comparison to a hypothetical where women are restricted is not accurate. The gym isn't preventing him from using the most parts of the facility. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
