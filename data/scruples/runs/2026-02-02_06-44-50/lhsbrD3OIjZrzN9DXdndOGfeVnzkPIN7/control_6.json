Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend wants them to switch to her gym so they can work out together. The problem is that this gym has a \"women only\" section, which is a quarter of the gym's area and equipment. The author objects because they feel it's unfair that they'd be charged the same but only have access to 75% of the gym's facilities. The girlfriend thinks the author is being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue. The author is upset about the unequal access based on gender. The gym charges the same for both genders but reserves part of the space for women only. The author's reasoning is that if they have to pay for the full gym but can't use a part of it, it's unfair. The girlfriend, on the other hand, argues that it's different for women, which might imply that she sees the women-only section as necessary or justified.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author's concern is about fairness and equal access. If the gym is charging the same price but restricting access to certain areas based on gender, that could be seen as discriminatory against men. However, the women-only section might be intended to provide a safe space for women, which is a common argument for such sections in gyms. The author's argument is that they're paying for a service they can't fully use, which could be a valid point. But the girlfriend's perspective is that the women's section is there for a reason, maybe for comfort or safety, which is a different value.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and legal aspects, in many places, single-sex spaces can be allowed under certain conditions, especially if they serve a specific purpose. However, if the gym is offering a service where part is exclusive to one gender without a proportional discount for the other, that could be a point of contention. The author's stance is about equal treatment, while the girlfriend's is about the necessity of the women's section. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to support a policy that they see as discriminatory. From one angle, the author is standing up for equality and fairness, which is a valid position. From another, maybe the author isn't considering that the women's section is a positive space for women, and their refusal might be seen as not supporting their girlfriend's comfort. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's reasoning is that they shouldn't have to pay for something they can't use. That's a logical argument. However, the gym's policy might be designed to encourage more women to join, which could be a separate factor. If the gym is willing to charge the same despite the division, then the author's objection is about access. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is an asshole, it depends on if their argument is valid. If the gym's policy is indeed discriminatory (same price for less access), then the author has a point. But if the women's section is a feature that the gym provides and they're not making men pay for it (though they do charge the same, but the author can still use the other 75%), maybe the author's stance is too rigid. \n\nThe girlfriend's response that the author is being stupid might indicate that she doesn't see the issue as clearly as he does. The author's hypothetical question about whether she'd accept the opposite scenario is a fair point, but she reacts negatively. This could suggest that she values the women-only section more, and the author is not seeing her perspective. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. His argument about fairness and equal access is valid. However, the situation might require more discussion between them to reach a mutual understanding. The answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because his reasoning is based on equity and he's trying to communicate his concerns, even if the girlfriend doesn't agree.\n"
