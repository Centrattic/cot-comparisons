Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author and his girlfriend both like working out at different gyms. The girlfriend wants them to go to the same gym so they can carpool and work out together. The issue is that her gym has a \"women only\" section, which takes up a quarter of the gym and equipment. The author is upset because he would pay the same fee as her but only have access to 75% of the equipment if he switched. He argues it's sexist because he's being excluded based on gender. His girlfriend thinks he's being unreasonable and says it's different for women.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The gym charges the same fee for everyone but has a section reserved for one gender. The author is refusing to go there because he can't use all the equipment. The girlfriend thinks it's okay because the women-only section is for her. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if the gym charges the same price but restricts access based on gender, that could be seen as discriminatory. In many places, gender-based separation in public facilities is illegal unless there's a specific justification, like safety or privacy. However, gyms sometimes offer women-only sections for reasons like creating a safer space, especially in areas where women might feel uncomfortable. But from the author's perspective, paying full price for limited access isn't fair. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument that \"it's different for women\" might stem from understanding that these sections exist to address historical inequalities or to provide a more comfortable environment. But the author is pointing out a discrepancy: if he can't use all the equipment, it's a form of exclusion. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, if the gym's policy is legal and there's a legitimate reason for the women-only section, then maybe the author is overreacting. But if the gym isn't providing equivalent value for the same price, that's a valid concern. Also, considering that the author is being charged the same as his girlfriend but gets less access, it's a matter of fairness. \n\nI think the key is whether the gym's policy is justified. If the women-only section is for a valid reason, the author might be wrong to object. But if it's just an arbitrary restriction without a valid reason, he's justified. However, in many cases, such sections aren't illegal unless they're the only option. Since the gym has a mixed area as well, the author could use the larger part. But the problem is that the women-only section is a significant portion, so maybe the author feels it's unfair to pay for access he doesn't get. \n\nI'm a bit torn. The girlfriend might not see the issue because she benefits from the women-only section, and the author might be missing the underlying reasons for its existence. But from a fairness and equality standpoint, if the gym isn't offering the same access to all members, that's an issue. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. He's pointing out a potential inequity. \n\nAlternatively, if the gym is allowed to have such sections (e.g., for privacy or safety reasons), then the author's problem is more about personal preference than systemic sexism. In that case, he might be the one being unreasonable by not wanting to switch gyms. \n\nHmm. I think the answer depends on the context of the gym's policies and local laws. But based on the information given, the author is arguing that he's being excluded based on gender for the same price, which is a valid concern. The girlfriend dismisses his argument, possibly not understanding his perspective. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
