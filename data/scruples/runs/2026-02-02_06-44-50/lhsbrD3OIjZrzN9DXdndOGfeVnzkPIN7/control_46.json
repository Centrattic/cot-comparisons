Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author and their girlfriend both work out, but at different gyms. The girlfriend suggests they switch to the same gym so they can carpool and work out together. The problem is that the girlfriend's gym has a \"women only\" section. The author is upset because even though men pay the same fee as women, they can't use that 25% of the gym. The author argues that it's unfair to pay full price for less access, and the girlfriend thinks he's being stupid. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue. The author is objecting to a policy where a specific section is reserved for women, which he sees as discriminatory against men. But his girlfriend is saying \"it's different for women,\" which might imply that women's safety or comfort is a reason for the women-only area. \n\nSo, is the author wrong for not supporting his girlfriend's suggestion? Well, from a fairness perspective, if the gym charges everyone the same but restricts access based on gender, that could be a point of contention. The author is essentially saying that if he's being charged the same, he should have access to all the facilities. On the other hand, the existence of a women-only section might be intended to create a safe space for women, which is a common reason for such sections in gyms.\n\nBut here's the thing: if the gym is providing a service (the women-only area) that men can't use, but charging them the same, that might be a legitimate complaint. However, the problem might be that the author isn't acknowledging the reasons behind the women-only section. Maybe the girlfriend values having a space where she feels comfortable without men, which is a valid concern. The author's argument is about equal access, but the gym's policy is about creating different experiences, not necessarily charging more for less in a way that's directly related to the service provided.\n\nWait, but if the woman-only area is part of the gym and included in the membership fee, then men are paying for a section they can't use. That could be seen as unfair. However, perhaps the gym packages all services together, so even if a section is women-only, the membership cost is for the entire facility. If the gym isn't reducing the fee for women because they can't use part of the equipment, then maybe the author's comparison isn't accurate. \n\nBut the author's point is that they're being charged the same but can't use a portion of the equipment. If the gym's membership includes all areas, but some areas are restricted, then the author is right to feel that it's unfair. However, the gym might argue that the women-only section is a value-added service, and men are still getting the rest of the facilities. The problem arises when the author is not considering the intent behind the women-only area. \n\nIf the girlfriend feels that the women-only section is important for her to feel safe or comfortable, then the author's refusal to join her gym could be seen as dismissing her needs. The author is focusing on the financial aspect, but maybe the girlfriend values the social and psychological benefits of the women-only space. \n\nSo the question is: Is the author wrong for not recognizing the importance of the women-only section to his girlfriend, thereby prioritizing his own comfort over her needs? Or is he right in pointing out potential unfairness in the gym's pricing model?\n\nIn terms of fairness and equality, if the gym offers a women-only section but charges men the same, that could be a point of contention. However, the existence of such sections is often to address gender disparities in fitness environments. Women might feel marginalized or uncomfortable in co-ed gyms, so a women-only area can be empowering. The author's issue is with the pricing model, but if the gym isn't actually charging women less, then the criticism might not hold. However, the author's perspective is that if he can't use part of the facility, it's a fair complaint. \n\nBut the girlfriend argues that it's different for women. That might imply that the author isn't understanding the reasons why such a section exists. The author is framing it as a financial issue, but the girlfriend is framing it as a gender issue. \n\nIn terms of who is the asshole, the author is standing by his principles about fairness in pricing and access, while the girlfriend feels her needs are being ignored. It's possible that both have valid points but are not seeing each other's perspectives. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the gym isn't violating any laws or discriminatory practices (assuming the women-only section is legal), then the author's objection is more about personal preference. \n\nBut if the gym is charging the same price but restricting access based on gender, that could be seen as discriminatory against men, depending on the legal context. However, in many places, such sections are allowed if they are optional and not the only service provided. If the gym still offers the majority of the facilities to everyone, then the author's complaint might be less about discrimination and more about wanting to use all the equipment available. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is wrong for not accepting the women-only section. If the girlfriend's gym is important to her and the author is willing to compromise, maybe the author is being unreasonable. On the other hand, if the pricing model is indeed unfair, the author has a point. \n\nBut the way the question is framed, the author is asking if he's being an asshole. The girlfriend's response that he's being stupid and not understanding might indicate that he's not considering her perspective. The author's hypothetical question to her (would she go to a gym that charged her the same but restricted her access?) is a valid way to test for consistency, but the girlfriend's reaction suggests she feels there's a difference. \n\nSo, in conclusion, the author is not wrong in pointing out what he perceives as an inconsistency in pricing and access. However, the girlfriend's perspective is also valid as it relates to her comfort and the reasons for the women-only section. The author might not be in the wrong for his stance, but the conflict arises from both parties not fully understanding each other's viewpoints. Therefore, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
