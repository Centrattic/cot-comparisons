Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to go to the same gym as their girlfriend because the gym has a women-only section. The author argues that since the gym charges the same fee for both genders but restricts part of the facility to women, it's sexist. The girlfriend thinks the author is overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The gym has a women-only section, which is 1/4 of the equipment and area. The author is saying that if he pays the same fee as women, he should have access to the same equipment, and not being allowed into the women-only section because of his gender is unfair. The girlfriend says it's different for women, and the author is being too sensitive.\n\nThe key points here are about equality and discrimination. The author is objecting to a policy that seems discriminatory from his perspective. However, the women-only section is actually a provision to create a safer space for women, which is a common practice in many gyms to address issues like harassment or discomfort some women feel in mixed-gender environments. So, in that sense, the gym isn't charging women more; instead, they're providing a subsection that's exclusive to women. The author is arguing that he should not be excluded from that section because of his gender, but the existence of such sections is often to protect women's access and safety.\n\nThe author's analogy is asking if the girlfriend would accept a gym that charged her the same but had a men-only section she couldn't use. The girlfriend gets upset, which might indicate she sees the women-only section as necessary for her. If the author is trying to equate both situations, he might be missing the nuance that the women-only section is a response to historical gender disparities and safety concerns, not an arbitrary exclusion. Therefore, the author's reasoning might be flawed because he's not considering the reasons behind the women-only section. \n\nHowever, the author's stance is that he shouldn't be denied access to part of the gym he paid for. But in reality, the gym could have a men-only section if they wanted, and if that's allowed, then a women-only section is also permissible. The author is not being denied access to the gym overall; he's just not allowed into a specific section. The key is whether the policy is sexist. If the gym is providing a women-only area for valid reasons, then the author isn't being treated unfairly. He's just not allowed into an area that exists for a specific purpose. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong here because he's not understanding the purpose of the women-only section and is framing the issue as a personal slight rather than recognizing it as a policy meant to support women. His argument about not using 75% of the equipment is also misleading because the total access isn't restricted; the women-only section is an additional benefit for women, not a restriction for men. The author is conflating paying for full access with the gym's decision to create a subsection for a specific group. Therefore, the correct answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
