Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch to his girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. The key points here are the structure of the gym, the charging policy, and the differing perspectives between the couple.\n\nFirst, the gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women. The women-only section takes up a quarter of the gym's area and equipment. The author's issue is that men can't use that section, so they're paying full price for 75% access. The girlfriend argues it's different for women, possibly implying that the women-only section is a positive feature for her.\n\nThe author is comparing it to a hypothetical where women are charged the same but can't use a part of the gym. The girlfriend gets upset, saying it's different for women. The crux is whether the author's reasoning is valid or if he's missing the point.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author's argument is about equity. If both genders pay the same but have unequal access, that's a problem. The gym's policy could be seen as discriminatory against men in that context. However, the women-only section might be intended to create a safe space for women, which is a common practice in some gyms to encourage female participation. The girlfriend might value that aspect, and the author's refusal to switch could be seen as not respecting her needs or the reasons behind the section's existence.\n\nBut the author is also making a logical argument about equal access for equal price. If the gym charges full price but restricts access based on gender, that's unequal treatment. However, the existence of the women-only section isn't necessarily discriminatory if it's part of the gym's strategy to cater to women's preferences. The problem arises if the author is equating both scenarios without understanding the different contexts.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the gym's policy is a voluntary choice to include a women-only section, and the author is objecting to that choice on the grounds of equity, he might not be in the wrong. But if the girlfriend's request is about shared experiences and mutual compromise, his refusal could be seen as not being flexible. However, the author's stance is based on a legitimate concern about fairness. Therefore, the answer would hinge on whether the gym's practice is discriminatory, which it might not be if both sides are aware and agree. The girlfriend's upset reaction might stem from her valuing the women-only section, not necessarily the author being wrong. So, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
