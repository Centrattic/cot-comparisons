Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to switch to the girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. The main issue is about equality and access.\n\nThe author's argument is that the gym charges the same fee for both genders but restricts men from using a quarter of the equipment and space. That seems inherently unequal. If a man had to pay full price but couldn't use all the facilities, that would be a valid complaint. The author is pointing out a double standard by comparing it to the hypothetical scenario where the roles were reversed.\n\nThe girlfriend's response is that it's \"different for women.\" That's a bit vague. Maybe she's referring to historical reasons or the need for women to have a safe space. But if the gym is charging men the same but not providing equal access, that's a problem regardless of the reasoning. The author isn't being sexist by wanting equal treatment; he's highlighting a disparity.\n\nSo, is the author the asshole? Probably not. He's standing up for equal treatment. The girlfriend's gym might have good intentions, but the policy isn't fair if it's enforced with equal pricing but unequal access. The author's stance is about fairness, not being closed-minded. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
