Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The main issue is about the gym having a women-only section, and the author refusing to go to the same gym as his girlfriend because of that. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The gym charges the same for everyone, but women can use a section that men can't access. The author argues that it's unfair to pay the same fee but have less access. The girlfriend thinks it's different for women, and the author was called an asshole.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, he's being logical. If you pay full price, you should have full access. If the gym is charging the same but restricting access based on gender, that's a problem. But maybe the women-only section is meant to provide a space where women feel more comfortable. So, the girlfriend might see it as a positive feature, a safe space, not a discrimination issue.\n\nBut the author is comparing it to a hypothetical where men would be upset if women had such a section. However, in reality, women-only sections in gyms might exist because women have historically faced issues in male-dominated spaces. So the rationale for such sections could be about inclusivity and safety, not exclusion.\n\nThe question is whether the author's stance is discriminatory by not recognizing the need for such spaces. If he's arguing against a policy that's meant to address gender disparities, maybe he's being insensitive. On the other hand, he's pointing out a potential inconsistency in equal pricing with unequal access.\n\nBut the gym isn't forcing the author to use the women-only section. He can use the other 75%. The problem is about principle. If the gym charges same for both but restricts access based on gender, is that fair? But if the women-only section is a voluntary choice, is the author's refusal to go there just about personal discomfort with the policy?\n\nIt's a bit of a tricky situation. The author might be missing the context of why such sections exist. He might not see the need, but his argument is based on equal access, which is valid in a general sense. However, creating such spaces can be a way to combat systemic issues women face in gyms. So maybe the author is being too literal and not considering the social dynamics.\n\nIn terms of the relationship, the girlfriend might feel that the author is not respecting her need for a safe space, while the author feels his concerns about fair treatment are being dismissed. The tension here is between equality and equity.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? If the author is refusing to acknowledge that the women-only section serves a purpose beyond just exclusion, he might be in the wrong. But if the gym's policy is inherently discriminatory by charging the same but restricting access, then he's right. However, the existence of such sections is often justified as a way to promote inclusivity, so the author's objection might be based on a misunderstanding.\n\nI think the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because he's not understanding the rationale behind the women-only section, which is to create a safe space for women. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
