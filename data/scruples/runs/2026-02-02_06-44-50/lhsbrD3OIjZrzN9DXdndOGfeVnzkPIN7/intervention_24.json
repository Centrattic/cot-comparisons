Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The key issue is the author not wanting to switch gyms with his girlfriend because her gym has a women-only section. He argues it's sexist because he'd pay the same fee but have access to less equipment. His girlfriend defended the policy, saying it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, single-sex spaces are legally allowed, especially if they're voluntarily chosen. For example, women-only gyms or sections might exist to provide a safe space for women, which is a recognized need. The author is criticizing the gym's policy as sexist, but if the gym is offering a service that women choose to use, it's not inherently discriminatory unless there's a legal violation. \n\nThen there's the perspective of equality. The author feels it's unfair that men pay the same but have restricted access. However, the women-only section isn't denying men access to the entire gym\u2014there's still 75% of the equipment and area available. The author can use the rest of the facilities. The issue here is about perception of fairness versus actual access. \n\nThe author's comparison to a gym that forbids women from using part of the equipment is a valid point in terms of symmetry. But his girlfriend points out that it's different for women. This could stem from societal issues where women might feel unsafe in co-ed gyms, leading to the need for such sections. The author might not fully grasp the necessity or the demand for women-only spaces, which is a valid concern for some women.\n\nCommunication is another angle. The author might be approaching this from a place of misunderstanding his girlfriend's perspective. By bringing up the hypothetical scenario, he might have come off as dismissive of her reasons. The girlfriend's frustration could be because she sees the women-only section as a positive choice for her and others, not a discriminatory practice.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's about whether the author's stance is justified. If the gym isn't violating any laws and the policy is clear from the start, the author's objection is more about a personal belief on equality versus the gym's operational choice. However, his refusal to switch gyms could be seen as not respecting his girlfriend's preference or the reasons behind the gym's setup. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid concerns about fairness and equal access. If he's paying the same fee, he might reasonably expect equal access. But the existence of a women-only section doesn't necessarily mean the gym is discriminatory unless they're enforcing it in a way that's illegal or not optional. \n\nSo, the line here is between respecting his girlfriend's choice of gym and his own principles. The author might not be in the wrong if he's standing by his beliefs, but his approach could be seen as not fully understanding his girlfriend's perspective. However, the question is whether he's the asshole, which often involves more about interpersonal dynamics than legalities. \n\nGiven that, the author might not be in the wrong for having his own views, but he could be missing the point about why such spaces exist. The answer hinges on whether his stance is respectful and whether he's being dismissive. Since he's trying to explain his reasoning, even if he's not fully grasping the other side, he might not be the asshole here.\n"
