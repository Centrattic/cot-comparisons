Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about whether it's sexist to have a \"women only\" section in a gym that charges the same fee but restricts access based on gender.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's girlfriend suggested they go to the same gym for convenience. The problem is the gym has a women-only section which takes up a quarter of the space and equipment. The author finds it sexist because men can't use that part, even though they pay the same. The girlfriend thinks it's different for women and got upset when the author questioned her about it.\n\nNow, I should consider the concept of gender segregation in facilities. There are cases where certain spaces or services are separated to accommodate specific needs, like women-only gyms for cultural or safety reasons. However, in this case, the gym isn't entirely women-only, just a section. The author is pointing out a potential inconsistency: if the gym charges the same for both genders but restricts access, isn't that a form of discrimination? The author is applying the same logic to both genders to highlight the issue.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests she sees the women-only section as a positive, possibly for women's comfort or empowerment. But the author is essentially pointing out that if the roles were reversed, she'd likely also find it unfair. The argument here is about equality\u2014why should one gender have restricted access when both pay the same? The gym's policy might be intended to support women, but it could inadvertently create a double standard.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the women-only section serves a purpose, like providing a safe space for women, which is different from being discriminatory. However, the author's perspective is about equal treatment, and the issue is that they're being excluded from part of the facility without a clear justification beyond gender. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the gym provided equivalent access or compensation for the restricted areas, it might be different. But since both pay the same fee and the author can't use a quarter of the gym, that seems unequal. The author isn't being bigoted; they're pointing out a logical inconsistency. The girlfriend might not see it that way because she benefits from the existing setup, but the author's stance is about equal rights.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They\u2019re challenging a policy that appears to enforce gender-based restrictions without a valid reason, which aligns with principles of equality. The girlfriend's dismissal of the author's concerns as \"stupid\" suggests a lack of understanding of the equality argument, making the author not the asshole here.\n"
