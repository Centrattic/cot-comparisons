Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his girlfriend both go to the gym but at different places. The girlfriend wants them to switch to her gym so they can carpool and work out together. The author is against it because her gym has a \"women only\" section. He's arguing that it's sexist because it's charging the same fee for men but restricting their access to 75% of the equipment and area. The girlfriend gets upset and says that it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to understand gender dynamics here. The \"women only\" sections in gyms are probably meant to create a safe space for women, where they can exercise without the presence of men. That might be to address issues like harassment or judgment. But the author sees it as discriminatory since men are excluded from that area, even though they pay the same fee. \n\nThe author's argument is about fairness: if you pay the same, you should have the same access. But the girlfriend's response is that it's different for women. Maybe she sees the women-only section as a positive initiative to support women, and she doesn't see why the author is upset. She might feel that the gym is doing something good for women, so why is the author upset because he can't access that part?\n\nBut from the author's perspective, if the gym charges the same fee and then restricts access based on gender, that's unequal treatment. He's drawing a parallel: if a gym charged women full price but restricted them from using most of the equipment, women would likely be upset. So why isn't the author's girlfriend understanding his point?\n\nHowever, there's a difference in the intent here. The women-only section is to protect women from harassment or provide a space where they feel comfortable. It's a form of affirmative space, which is different from denying someone access to something because of their gender. The author is treating both sides equally in terms of access, but the gym's policy isn't about denying access entirely but creating a separate, safer area for women. So maybe the author is missing the nuance here.\n\nThe girlfriend might feel that the gym is giving women more than they deserve by having a special section, which the author is not seeing. But the author is focusing on the restriction for men. The key here is whether gender-based restrictions in this context are inherently sexist. In some cases, women-only spaces are considered necessary to address historical and ongoing issues women face in male-dominated spaces. So, the gym's policy might be seen as a way to level the playing field for women, not as discrimination against men.\n\nOn the other hand, if the men are paying the same but can't access certain areas, it could be seen as discriminatory. But the difference is that the women are being given a space they need for empowerment or safety, whereas if it were the other way around, it might be different. The author is equating both sides, but the context is different. The gym is not denying access to all equipment but creating a specialized area for women's needs. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong if he's against unequal treatment, but he might not be understanding the purpose of the women-only section.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the gym's policy is to create a safe space for women, which is a valid reason, then the author's refusal to go there isn't about discrimination but about personal discomfort with the policy. However, if the gym is genuinely offering the same access except for gender-based restrictions, then the author's objection is valid. But if the women-only section is a small part of the gym and the rest is co-ed, then the author can still use the majority of the facilities. The problem is whether the author's stance is based on legitimate equality concerns or misunderstanding the intent behind the women-only space.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for objecting to a policy he perceives as unequal. However, his lack of understanding of why such spaces exist might be the issue. But the core issue is whether the gym's policy is discriminatory. If the gym allows women-only sections for valid reasons, then the author's objection could be seen as not recognizing those reasons, making him the asshole. But if the gym is restricting access without a valid reason, then the author is justified. Since the scenario states that the women-only section is a part of the gym, and the author is objecting to it, the answer hinges on whether the gym's policy is acceptable. Since the author is comparing it to a hypothetical where women are excluded, but the reality is that the gym is providing a space for women, the author might be missing the point. Therefore, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not understanding the purpose of the women-only section and equating both sides as discriminatory without considering the context.\n"
