Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their girlfriend for posting on gonewild is in the wrong. The situation is that he found her on a porn site, which he considers cheating. She, however, says that since it's the internet, it's not cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The guy clearly felt betrayed. He clicked on a post, found out it was his girlfriend, and confronted her. He says he felt like she was cheating, even though she disagrees. He ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop posting. \n\nNow, the key points here are about boundaries and consent. The girlfriend was sharing explicit content about herself online, which she might not have considered cheating if it's just on the internet. But the boyfriend's perspective is that it's a violation of trust, even if she's not physically with someone else. \n\nI should consider cultural norms here. In many relationships, sharing explicit content with others, even if it's online and consensual, can be a deal-breaker for some people. The fact that she suggested he join her for couple posts might indicate that she isn't aware of how seriously he takes this issue. \n\nHe was upset during the argument, said some harsh things, but ended the relationship because she refused to stop. The question is whether his reaction is justified. \n\nOn one hand, he has the right to set boundaries in a relationship. If he finds her behavior unacceptable, it's reasonable to confront her. However, breaking up immediately might be seen as extreme. On the other hand, if he had communicated his feelings earlier about her posts, maybe this wouldn't have happened. But since he didn't mention it until he found her on the site, he might have been unaware of her boundaries. \n\nThe girlfriend's view that internet activity isn't cheating could be a cultural or personal belief. However, the man's feelings are valid. The decision to end the relationship because of a core value (trust, boundaries) might be his right. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he felt the relationship could not continue without her respecting his boundaries, then no. But if she didn't know posting was a problem and he didn't address it earlier, maybe there's some fault. However, the act of sharing explicit content without the partner's knowledge is a breach of trust in many relationships. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong. He had the right to end the relationship if her actions violated his trust, especially since she didn't plan to stop.\n"
