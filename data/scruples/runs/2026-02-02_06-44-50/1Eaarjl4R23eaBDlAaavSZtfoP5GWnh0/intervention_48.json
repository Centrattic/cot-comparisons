Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend for posting on GoneWild is in the wrong. The key points here are about consent, privacy, and the definition of cheating.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend posted explicit content online. The boyfriend found out through a Reddit comment, which he didn't notice was her until later. He confronted her, and she argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. He got angry, said some harsh things, and broke up with her when she didn't agree to stop posting.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, cheating typically involves an extramarital affair, but in modern relationships, people often have boundaries about sharing intimate content. If the girlfriend didn't get consent from her partner to post such material, then she might be violating their trust. However, the boyfriend's reaction is also a factor. He admitted to saying nasty things during the confrontation. While her actions might be a deal-breaker, his method of handling it could be seen as harsh, especially if he didn't consider her perspective first. \n\nBut the core issue is whether posting explicit content without the partner's knowledge is acceptable. If the couple had an agreement about such things, her actions breached that. If not, it's more about differing values. The author's decision to end the relationship because of her actions is his right, but the way he handled the confrontation might be where he's at fault. However, the main question is about the breakup itself. If the girlfriend's actions were a deal-breaker for him, then maybe he's not wrong. But if he didn't have prior discussions about boundaries, he might have a point. However, the fact that she was posting without his knowledge is problematic. So, considering all angles, the answer might be B (No), because he's making a tough decision based on her violating trust. But some might argue that his anger and the breakup were too extreme. Yet, given the context, he's within his rights to end the relationship if this crosses a line for him.\n"
