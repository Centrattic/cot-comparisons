Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy found out his girlfriend was posting on gonewild, which is a site for explicit content. He broke up with her because he felt like she was cheating even though she said it wasn't cheating because it's online. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy's perspective: he discovered his girlfriend in explicit content, which he found shocking. He confronted her, got into an argument, and decided to break up because he felt it was a betrayal. His friends are upset with him, but he's not exposing her.\n\nThe girlfriend's side: she argues that posting on the internet isn't cheating. She even suggested he join her for couple posts, which might indicate she's not bothered by it and sees it as part of her personal expression. She didn't stop, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, the question is whether the guy was wrong. Cheating usually involves physical or emotional infidelity. Posting explicit content online, especially if it's consensual and not involving others, might not be considered cheating by some. However, the guy felt it crossed a line. The key here is about mutual boundaries in the relationship. If they didn't discuss this before, maybe it's a communication issue. But once it happened, the guy's reaction was to break up, which some might see as extreme, but others might support if it made him uncomfortable. \n\nThe girlfriend's stance that it's not cheating could be a deal-breaker for him. The guy's actions were based on his feelings of betrayal, even if others disagree. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether you think sharing explicit content without considering the partner's feelings is wrong, or if the guy overreacted. \n\nIn relationships, consent and communication are key. If she shared without considering his feelings, maybe she was wrong. If he didn't communicate his boundaries beforehand, maybe he shares some blame. But since the issue arose after the fact, the guy's decision to end it might be justified from his perspective. So, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong) because cheating definitions vary, and if it made him uncomfortable, he's entitled to leave.\n"
