Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend over her posting on gonewild is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy found her post on a site with explicit content and felt like she was cheating. They argued, and he ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Gonewild is a site known for explicit content, so posting there might be a big deal for some people. The guy was shocked to find her there and confronted her. She didn't see it as cheating, and he ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop.\n\nNow, whether he's in the wrong. Cheating definitions vary. Some people might consider sharing explicit content online as cheating, others don't. The guy felt betrayed, even if there's no physical infidelity. But maybe he overreacted? Did he give her a chance to explain or talk it through? He did confront her, but he also says he said some nasty things. The breakup happened quickly. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend was okay with posting explicit content and didn't think it was cheating, maybe the guy's reaction was his own issue. But if it made him feel uncomfortable and the relationship couldn't move past it, then ending it might be fair. \n\nThe key points are mutual respect and communication. If the guy couldn't accept her actions and she couldn't change, then splitting up is a valid choice. However, if there was a lack of discussion before the breakup, maybe he could have handled it better. But in the end, he's allowed to set boundaries. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he had the right to end the relationship if her actions made him feel betrayed. But some might argue that he should have communicated more before breaking up. Hmm.\n"
