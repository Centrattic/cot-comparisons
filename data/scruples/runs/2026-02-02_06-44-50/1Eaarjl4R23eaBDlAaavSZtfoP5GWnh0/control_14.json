Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their girlfriend for posting on gonewild is in the wrong. The question is whether their actions were justified.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The girlfriend posted explicit content online, including on gonewild, which the boyfriend discovered. The boyfriend felt betrayed and ended the relationship because she refused to stop posting, even suggesting they do couple posts together. The girlfriend argues that internet activity isn't cheating, but the boyfriend felt it was a violation of trust.\n\nNow, considering ethical perspectives. The boyfriend's reaction is based on his personal boundaries and feelings of betrayal. He felt she was exposing herself in a way he found unacceptable, which he equated to cheating. On the other hand, the girlfriend might believe that sharing content online is her choice, especially if it's consensual. \n\nLegally, unless there's a violation of a specific agreement (like a no-porn clause in the relationship), there's no law against sharing explicit content unless it involves non-consensual sharing. However, the moral aspect is subjective. The boyfriend's right to feel hurt is valid, but ending the relationship over it depends on both parties' expectations. If there was no prior discussion about such boundaries, the boyfriend's reaction might be seen as sudden, but it's his right to end things if this crosses his personal line.\n\nThe girlfriend suggesting they do couple posts together could be seen as dismissive of his feelings, which might have pushed him over the edge. The boyfriend's decision to break up is a personal choice based on his values and what he's willing to tolerate in a relationship. Since relationships require mutual respect and understanding of each other's boundaries, if these weren't discussed beforehand, both could be at fault. But in this case, the boyfriend acted based on his reaction to a situation he found unacceptable. \n\nConsidering the AITA framework, the community often considers intent and communication. The lack of prior communication about boundaries might mean the boyfriend's reaction was abrupt, but he's not in the wrong for choosing to end the relationship if it's a dealbreaker for him. The girlfriend's refusal to stop could be seen as not respecting his feelings once he expressed them. So the answer would likely be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
