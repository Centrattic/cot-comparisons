Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who broke up with his girlfriend is in the wrong. So, the situation is that he found out her GoWild posts, which included explicit content. He got upset, confronted her, and they argued. He ended the relationship because she didn't stop posting, and he felt like she was cheating even though she said it wasn't cheating because it's online. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to see both sides.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: he looked through her phone or history without her consent? Wait, he says he saw the post on Reddit, which he scrolls through normally. He clicked on a GoWild post and realized it was her. So maybe he didn't check her phone directly but stumbled upon it while browsing. Then he confronted her, got angry, and ended the relationship. The key points here are consent in the relationship and the boundaries around sharing explicit content.\n\nThe girlfriend's side: she was posting explicit content online. If they were in a committed relationship, posting such things might be a deal-breaker for some. But she argues that since it's online and not with someone else, it's not cheating. However, sharing explicit photos without the partner's knowledge or consent can be a trust issue. The author felt betrayed, which is a valid feeling if he found out she was sharing intimate content without discussing it with him.\n\nThe author's response: he confronted her, but got aggressive. He says he said some nasty things. That's not great communication. Ending the relationship because of this is his choice, but the method could be questioned. However, if the content was non-consensual to him, he has the right to set boundaries. The question is whether his reaction was justified.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. If she was posting explicit content without discussing it with him, that's a breach of trust. He had the right to feel hurt and decide that he couldn't continue the relationship. However, the way he handled it, getting angry and ending it abruptly, might not be the healthiest approach. But the core issue is about consent in sharing intimate content. If she did it without considering his feelings, that's a problem. On the other hand, if he had never discussed this with her before, maybe he should have addressed it differently instead of jumping to conclusions about cheating. Still, the final decision to end the relationship is his, and if her actions violated his boundaries, he's not necessarily in the wrong. So the answer might be B (No) because he's within his rights to end the relationship if her actions were a violation of trust. However, if she was doing something that's not inherently cheating (like sharing content without engaging with others), the issue is more about their agreement. But the main point is that he found out about her sharing explicit content without his knowledge, which can be a valid reason to break up. So I think the answer is B.\n"
