Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she posted on a site called Gonewild. First, I need to understand the situation properly. \n\nThe girlfriend and the author were in a relationship. The author found out that his girlfriend had posted something on Gonewild, which is an adult content site. He got upset, confronted her, and ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop posting. The girlfriend argued that posting on the internet isn't cheating. The author is now wondering if he was wrong to break up.\n\nI need to consider the key elements here. The main issue is the girlfriend sharing explicit content online. The question is whether this constitutes a betrayal or a violation of trust. The author felt that this was a deal-breaker. The girlfriend's stance is that since it's online, it's not cheating. \n\nFirst, I should think about the concept of cheating. Traditionally, cheating refers to physical or emotional infidelity. However, in modern relationships, boundaries can extend to digital spaces. Some people consider sharing explicit content online without consent as a violation of trust. So, if the author didn't know about this and it made him uncomfortable, his reaction might be understandable. \n\nThe girlfriend's suggestion that it's not cheating because it's online might be her perspective, but the author may have different boundaries. The fact that she was posting explicit content of herself could be seen as a privacy issue. Also, the argument arises when the author sees the post and realizes it's her. The shock and subsequent decision to break up might stem from feeling betrayed. \n\nHowever, there are other factors. The author didn't know about the posts beforehand. Maybe the girlfriend had discussed this with him before, but according to the story, she didn't. The author's reaction was immediate, but did he give her a chance to explain? The girlfriend wanted to continue doing it and even suggested he join her, which the author found unacceptable. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author's decision to end the relationship is based on his feelings of betrayal. However, if the girlfriend was sharing content consensually (assuming she consented to post it), then maybe the issue is about differing expectations. The author might have thought that such content should be private, especially within a relationship. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the girlfriend was explicit about her intention to post and the author didn't mind, then maybe he's wrong to break up. But since he found it out only after the fact and felt it was a betrayal, his reaction is based on his values. However, the girlfriend's actions might have been a violation of privacy if the author didn't consent to her sharing such content. \n\nI need to check if there's any legal or ethical standards here. Legally, she can post content of herself, but in a relationship, expectations about privacy can be part of the unspoken agreements. The author's discomfort is valid, but does that make breaking up justified? It's possible that the author overreacted, but given the emotional impact, it's also a personal decision.\n\nIn AITA situations, the community often looks at whether the person acted with empathy and communication. The author confronted her, but maybe he could have had a conversation first instead of immediately breaking up. However, given the circumstances, his stress and emotional reaction might be considered understandable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because he acted based on his feelings of betrayal, and the girlfriend's actions could be seen as a violation of privacy. However, there's a middle ground where both might have miscommunicated. But since the question is binary, and the author's decision to end the relationship is a personal choice, it's not necessarily wrong.\n"
