Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend because he found out she was posting on gonewild. He was browsing Reddit and accidentally clicked on a post which turned out to be her. He got upset, confronted her, and ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop posting. The question is whether he did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key points here are consent, trust, and mutual boundaries in a relationship. When someone is in a relationship, they usually expect a certain level of privacy and discretion regarding their personal actions. However, the girlfriend's actions of posting on gonewild (a site known for adult content) might be considered as sharing explicit content online. \n\nThe man's reaction was to end the relationship because he felt it was a betrayal, even though she argued that online presence isn't cheating. It's important to note that cheating can vary in definition between partners. Some might see sharing explicit content online as a violation of trust, especially if it's done without considering the partner's feelings or if it's public.\n\nHe was initially unaware it was her, but once he found out, he confronted her. She suggested continuing the relationship but not stopping the posts, which he couldn't accept. The question is whether ending the relationship was justified. \n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend was sharing explicit content, which could be seen as crossing a line, especially if it's public. The man might feel that this behavior is incompatible with their relationship. On the other hand, if they hadn't discussed boundaries beforehand, it's possible that the man's expectations weren't communicated clearly. \n\nHowever, the fact that she continued after being asked to stop might indicate that she valued her online presence over the relationship, which could justify the breakup. The man's decision to end things when his boundaries were not respected could be seen as a valid choice. \n\nBut maybe the man should have addressed it earlier instead of breaking up suddenly. However, given the circumstances, if communication had already failed during the argument and she wasn't willing to compromise, ending the relationship might be reasonable. \n\nSo, considering that cheating definitions can vary, but sharing explicit content without the partner's knowledge or consent might be a breach of trust. The man's decision to end the relationship because of this could be seen as not being in the wrong, depending on their agreed-upon boundaries. Since she didn't want to stop, and he felt it was a deal-breaker, B (not in the wrong) might be the answer.\n"
