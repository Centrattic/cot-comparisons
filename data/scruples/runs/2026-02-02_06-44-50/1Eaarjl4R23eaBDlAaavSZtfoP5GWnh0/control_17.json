Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their girlfriend for posting on Gonewild is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend had a post on a site that's typically for explicit content, and the guy found out it was her. He confronted her, they argued, and he broke up because he felt it was cheating, even though she said it wasn't.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The user is the guy, and he's upset because his girlfriend posted something on a site he considers NSFW. He found out it was her, felt betrayed, and ended the relationship. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nSo, the main factors here are consent and understanding in the relationship. Did they have any prior discussions about what constitutes cheating or boundaries regarding online activities? If the girlfriend was aware that posting explicit content on such a site was against his beliefs or their agreement, then she might be at fault. However, if there were no such discussions, the guy's reaction could be seen as overstepping.\n\nGonewild is a platform known for adult content, so posting there usually implies that the person is sharing explicit material. If the girlfriend didn't realize that the guy would find it offensive or consider it a boundary violation, that's on her. But if the guy hadn't communicated his feelings about such content before, maybe he's responsible for not setting clear boundaries.\n\nThe guy's reaction was to break up, which is a big step. He felt like she was cheating because of the online activity, but she didn't see it that way. The definition of cheating can vary between partners. If they had mutual understanding that online activities don't count as cheating, then his reaction might be hasty. However, if he felt it violated their trust, then his decision could be seen as justified based on his feelings.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's suggestion that he join her for couple posts adds another layer. That might have pushed him over the edge, as it could imply she's okay with sharing more explicit content involving both of them, which he might find even more unacceptable.\n\nBut, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the couple didn't have prior agreements about online boundaries, and he didn't express his discomfort before, then he might be at fault for not communicating his boundaries. However, if he had communicated this before and she ignored it, then she's at fault. Since the story doesn't mention prior discussions, it's hard to say. But generally, in relationships, both parties should communicate their expectations. If he didn't talk about it before, breaking up because of this might be seen as his overreaction. On the other hand, if her actions made him feel betrayed regardless of prior communication, his feelings are valid.\n\nIn many cases, cheating definitions are subjective. If the girlfriend didn't consider it cheating, but the guy did, then it's a difference in perspective. However, breaking up might be a harsh response if there was no prior agreement. But relationships require mutual respect for boundaries. If she posted something that violates his trust, even without prior discussion, he has the right to end the relationship if he feels it's incompatible.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might hinge on whether the guy communicated his boundaries. Since there's no mention of prior communication, it's possible the author is in the wrong for not discussing his feelings beforehand. However, his right to end the relationship if he feels disrespected is also valid. It's a tricky situation, but given the lack of prior discussion, maybe the answer is that he isn't in the wrong because he's entitled to his feelings, but the girlfriend might share some responsibility for not respecting his potential boundaries.\n"
