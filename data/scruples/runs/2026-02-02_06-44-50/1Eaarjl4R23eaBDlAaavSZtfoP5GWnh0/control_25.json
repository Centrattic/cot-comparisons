Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend after finding out she posted explicit content of herself on a site called gonewild. He saw her post on Reddit, realized it was her, confronted her, and they had a big argument. He said he felt like she was cheating because she was posting on the internet, and she disagreed, saying it's not cheating. He ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop posting, and now he's wondering if he was at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key issue here is whether posting explicit photos online constitutes cheating. The girlfriend argues that it's not cheating because it's just the internet, but the boyfriend felt betrayed. The problem is that cheating definitions can vary between couples. If they didn't have prior agreement about what constitutes cheating, the boyfriend's reaction might be seen as valid, but maybe he should have communicated his boundaries earlier.\n\nHe found out through her Reddit post, which he stumbled upon by accident. That could be a privacy issue. Maybe she didn't want him to see it, but she also didn't hide her identity in the post. If the post was public, she might be aware that others could see it, but did she know he would see it? The fact that he found her post by scrolling through Reddit after a night out is a bit of a coincidence. \n\nHe confronted her the next day, and she suggested he join her for couple posts, which probably made him feel even worse. His reaction of saying he didn't want to continue the relationship if she didn't stop might be harsh, but if he felt that her actions were a deal-breaker, maybe it's his right to end it. However, the way he handled it could be questioned\u2014did he give her a chance to explain or address the issue before breaking up? He did wait until morning, but he was upset and maybe didn't approach it calmly. \n\nCheating is subjective. Some people might see public explicit content as a breach of trust, even if it's not with someone else. Others might not. The question is whether the author had the right to expect that she wouldn't post such content. If there was no prior discussion about this, then maybe both sides are at fault. However, since he ended the relationship because he found it unacceptable, and she didn't want to stop, it's his choice. \n\nAlso, the fact that she suggested couple posts implies she might be okay with sharing explicit content involving her partner, but he clearly wasn't okay with that. So, his decision to leave because of her actions is based on his own boundaries. Unless there was a direct agreement that she wouldn't post such things, maybe he's not wrong for ending it. \n\nBut was he wrong to break up over this? It's a matter of personal values and communication. If he didn't set clear boundaries before, maybe he's partially at fault for not discussing this earlier. However, since he did confront her and she didn't respect his feelings, ending the relationship might be justified. \n\nIn the AITA context, usually, the person is considered in the right if their actions are based on reasonable expectations and they communicated their boundaries. Here, the author didn't set expectations beforehand, but upon discovering something that made him feel betrayed, he tried to address it. Since she didn't change her behavior, his decision to end it might be seen as not being in the wrong. So, answer B (No).\n"
