Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend over her posting on Gonewild is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe user found out that his girlfriend posted a nude photo on a site called Gonewild. He was initially unaware it was her because he clicked on the post not recognizing her. Then he got upset and confronted her, leading to a breakup. She argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. The user then decided to end the relationship because she didn't want to stop posting, even suggesting they do couple posts together. Now he's asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The main issue is whether sharing explicit content online constitutes cheating. The girlfriend's stance is that it's not cheating, while the user felt it was a betrayal. \n\nCheating typically involves infidelity or actions that breach trust in a relationship. However, sharing nude photos online isn't physical infidelity, but it can be a violation of trust and boundaries. The user felt hurt and betrayed, which is a valid emotional response. \n\nNext, the user confronted her, and she didn't want to stop, even suggesting they do it together. The user's decision to break up because of this disagreement is his way of setting a boundary. However, some might argue that he overreacted, especially if the content was consensual and not shared with others. \n\nOn the other hand, the user's reaction is understandable if he found the act of posting explicit photos online unacceptable. Relationships require mutual respect for each other's boundaries. If the girlfriend didn't value his feelings and insisted on continuing, the user might feel that the relationship is untenable. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of communication. Did the user express his discomfort before this incident? If he never discussed his boundaries about her online activity, then he might be partly at fault for not addressing it earlier. However, in this case, he found out through her online presence, which could mean he wasn't aware of her habits beforehand. \n\nAnother angle is whether posting explicit content is a deal-breaker. It's subjective. Some people might not care, others would. The user made his decision based on his own values and comfort, which is his right. \n\nHowever, the way he confronted her\u2014being aggy (aggressive) and saying nasty things\u2014might not be the healthiest approach. But his actions afterward, ending things because she didn't respect his boundary, could be justified. \n\nIn conclusion, whether he's in the wrong depends on the relationship's context. If he had previously discussed boundaries and she ignored them, he's justified. If he never mentioned it and this was a sudden issue, maybe he overreacted. But since the situation is presented without prior context, it's reasonable to consider his decision as setting a boundary, hence not in the wrong.\n"
