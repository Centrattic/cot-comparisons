Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after finding her on a site like Gonewild.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The GF has posts on a site that's known for explicit content. The author stumbled upon her post while browsing Reddit, realized it was her, and confronted her. She argued that posting online isn't cheating, suggested they do couple posts together, and he ended the relationship because she wouldn't stop.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. Let's consider the girlfriend's perspective. If she's sharing explicit content online, even if it's consensual, it could be a dealbreaker for some people. The author felt betrayed and thought it was cheating, which led to the breakup. But the GF's stance is that the internet isn't cheating, which might be a cultural or personal belief. \n\nThe author's actions: He confronted her, got emotional, said some hurtful things, then ended the relationship when she refused to stop. Is this justified? It depends on their agreement. If there was an understood boundary about not sharing explicit photos, then her actions might be a violation. But if there was no prior discussion, maybe the author overreacted. However, the fact that she suggested couple posts might indicate she was okay with it and wanted to involve him, which he wasn't comfortable with. \n\nThe author's decision to break up because of her online activity could be seen as his right if it's a personal dealbreaker. But is he wrong for doing so? Maybe not. People have different values. However, the way he handled it\u2014being aggressive, not discussing it calmly first\u2014might contribute to the problem. But the core issue is whether posting explicit content is considered cheating. In many modern relationships, sharing explicit content without consent is considered a breach of trust. If the couple had an agreement that this wasn't acceptable, then the GF violated that. If they didn't, then the author's reaction is based on his own discomfort, which he's entitled to act on. \n\nBut the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. Maybe they think that the GF's actions weren't cheating, so the breakup is unwarranted. However, some people might still feel betrayed regardless of the medium. So it's a nuanced situation. \n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the context of their relationship expectations. If there was an unspoken agreement about not sharing such content, the GF might be at fault. If not, the author is acting on his personal boundaries. Since the scenario doesn't mention prior agreements, it's a bit of a gray area. But the author's decision to end the relationship based on his discomfort with her online activity isn't necessarily in the wrong if it's a dealbreaker for him. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), but I need to check if there's a stronger case for A.\n"
