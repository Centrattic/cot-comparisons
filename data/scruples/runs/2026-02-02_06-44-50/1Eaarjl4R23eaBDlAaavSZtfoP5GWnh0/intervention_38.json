Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after finding her on Gonewild. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend and boyfriend were in a relationship. The author found a post on Gonewild (which I know is a site for adult content) that he later realized was his girlfriend. He felt cheated on because she was posting explicit material. He confronted her, got into an argument, and broke up because she didn't want to stop posting. She argued that since it was the internet, it wasn't cheating. The author is now wondering if he did the right thing.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want an opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, sharing explicit content online can be a personal choice, but if it's a problem for the partner, communication is key. The girlfriend might have thought she was okay with it, but the author felt it was a betrayal. However, the line between cheating and personal privacy is tricky here. Cheating usually involves a physical or emotional affair, but sharing content might be seen as a different issue.\n\nThe author broke up because she refused to stop. Is that fair? It depends on their agreement and boundaries. If they had discussed this before and she agreed not to post such content, then her actions could be considered a breach. However, if there was no prior discussion, maybe the author overreacted. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend suggested making couple posts together, which might indicate she wasn't entirely against it, but wanted to continue. The author's reaction might be based on his own discomfort with her actions. The key point is whether the content was shared with others beyond their relationship, which could be a privacy concern. \n\nIn many relationships, sharing explicit content without the partner's knowledge can be a deal-breaker for some. The author might feel violated, even if no physical affair occurred. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel her autonomy was respected. \n\nSo, the author's decision to break up could be seen as his right if he values honesty and privacy in the relationship. However, some might argue that the breakup was too drastic if there was no prior agreement. \n\nBut since the author felt it was a betrayal and couldn't reconcile the issue, his actions might be justified. Therefore, he might not be in the wrong. The answer could be B.\n"
