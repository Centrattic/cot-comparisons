Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she posted on GoWild, which is a platform known for explicit content.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out that his girlfriend had posted a pornographic photo of herself on GoWild. He initially clicked on the post without realizing it was her, then became upset because he felt she was cheating by sharing explicit content online. They had an argument, and he broke up with her because she didn't want to stop posting, even suggesting they do couple posts together. He's now wondering if he was wrong to end the relationship.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Did the girlfriend do something wrong by posting explicit content? Is the author justified in breaking up over this? The girlfriend argues that since it's the internet and she's not cheating, it's not a valid reason to break up. But the author felt betrayed, like she was cheating, even though there's no physical infidelity. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. If the girlfriend shared explicit photos without her partner's knowledge, that could be a breach of trust. However, the concept of cheating varies between relationships. Some people might consider sharing explicit photos as cheating, while others might not. The girlfriend's suggestion to do couple posts might indicate she didn't see it as a problem, which could exacerbate the author's feelings of betrayal.\n\nThe author's reaction\u2014breaking up after a conflict where he said some harsh things\u2014might be a result of his hurt and feeling disrespected. However, he needs to consider if his actions were proportionate. Ending a relationship because of something that isn't traditionally considered cheating could be seen as extreme by some. On the other hand, if the girlfriend was nonchalant about sharing explicit content and didn't respect his boundaries, the author might have valid reasons to end the relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend's actions were a violation of their agreed-upon boundaries, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, if there were no prior discussions about boundaries and the author judged her actions without considering her perspective, he might be in the wrong. The scenario doesn't mention prior discussions about online behavior, so it's ambiguous. \n\nIn many cases, relationships require mutual understanding and negotiation of boundaries. If the author didn't discuss this with his girlfriend beforehand, he might be overreacting. However, if he felt her actions were a betrayal, even if others don't see it that way, his feelings are valid. The answer hinges on whether the act of posting explicit content is considered cheating in their context. Since the girlfriend didn't see it that way, but the author did, it's a matter of differing values. \n\nIn such cases, breaking up because of irreconcilable differences is not necessarily wrong. The author might not be in the wrong if he felt her actions were incompatible with their relationship. So, the answer could be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But some might argue A (Yes) if they believe the action doesn't constitute cheating. However, given the context and the emotional impact, B is more likely correct.\n"
