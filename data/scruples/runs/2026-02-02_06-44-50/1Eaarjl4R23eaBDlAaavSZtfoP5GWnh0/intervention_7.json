Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to think through this. So the question is whether the author did the wrong thing by breaking up with his girlfriend because she posted on gonewild. First, I need to understand the situation properly.\n\nThe user posted on Reddit about breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she was on gonewild, a site for explicit content. He was scrolling through Reddit after a night out and accidentally saw a post that turned out to be his girlfriend. She had other posts there too, and he got upset, thinking it was like cheating. They argued, and he broke up with her, not wanting to continue if she didn't stop posting. She tried to suggest they make couple posts together, but he ended things.\n\nNow, the user is asking if he's in the wrong (AITA). The person who posted thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. The question here is for me to decide: A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. Cheating typically involves physical or emotional infidelity. Posting on a site like gonewild is public, but is that considered cheating? The girlfriend argued it wasn't. The author felt betrayed, but maybe that's his own perception. The key here is whether sharing explicit content online counts as cheating in a relationship. Some people might have different boundaries. If the couple had an agreement about such things, then maybe breaking that agreement is a valid reason. But if there was no prior discussion, it's debatable.\n\nThe author acted impulsively after an argument, saying some nasty things. That might indicate he didn't handle it well. Breaking up immediately might be rash. Also, the girlfriend's suggestion to do couple posts together could have been a way to reconcile, but he rejected it. Maybe he didn't give her a chance to explain or address the issue. \n\nOn the other hand, finding out a partner is sharing explicit content publicly could be a deal-breaker for some. If the author felt it violated trust, even if others might not see it as cheating, it's his right to set boundaries. However, the way he handled it\u2014confronting her harshly and breaking up without giving her a chance to discuss\u2014might be problematic.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the issue is about mutual boundaries, and there was no prior agreement, then maybe he overreacted. But if sharing such content is against his values and he communicated that, then he's within his rights. But since he didn't give her a chance to explain or agree on terms, and instead just broke up, maybe the way he handled it was wrong. Alternatively, if he felt genuinely betrayed, maybe it's not his fault. \n\nI think the key is whether the act itself (posting explicit content online) is considered cheating. If the girlfriend is correct that it's not, then the author's reaction might be unwarranted. But if the author believes it is, then it's a boundary issue. However, the way he ended the relationship might be too abrupt without proper communication. So, perhaps the author is in the wrong because he didn't address it calmly and broke up immediately. But I'm not sure. Maybe both sides have valid points. However, according to the AITA framework, if the person did something the other found unacceptable but it's not cheating, then the person breaking up might be in the wrong. So I'm leaning towards A.\n"
