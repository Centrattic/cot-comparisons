Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend because she posted something on gonewild (which is a site for explicit content). The key points are: he found her post, got upset, confronted her, argued, and ended things because she didn't want to stop posting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend didn't actually cheat, but shared explicit content online. The author felt this was a betrayal, but the girlfriend didn't think it was cheating because it was the internet. The author then broke up with her. \n\nNow, whether he's in the wrong. The question is about whether his actions were justified. Some people might say that sharing explicit content is a personal choice and if it's consensual, it's not cheating. However, if the relationship had boundaries about such content, then maybe the girlfriend crossed a line. But the problem is that the author is the one who ended the relationship. \n\nBut wait, the author says he felt like she was cheating. Maybe he had boundaries that she wasn't aware of. But he didn't talk to her about this before she posted? Or maybe he should have? If he didn't communicate his feelings about sharing explicit content beforehand, then maybe he's in the wrong for not discussing it. But if he thought it was okay, then maybe she overstepped. \n\nThe girlfriend suggested doing couple posts, which might imply she wasn't planning to stop. So he ended the relationship because she didn't respect his boundaries. But maybe he should have talked to her first without being aggressive. The way he confronted her was \"aggy\" (aggressive?), leading to a bad argument. \n\nBut the core issue is whether sharing explicit content is acceptable in their relationship. If they had an open discussion, maybe they could have resolved it. However, the author felt hurt and ended things. Whether he's in the wrong depends on if communication was lacking or if he overreacted. \n\nSome might argue that he's not wrong because he's standing up for his boundaries. Others might say he's wrong because she didn't cheat and he didn't handle it calmly. The answer could be either A or B, but the user thinks A (he's wrong). But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is B because he had a valid reason to feel betrayed even if it wasn't cheating. Or A because he didn't handle it properly.\n"
