Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend over her posting on gonewild is in the wrong. The original poster (AITA) is the author.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend posted explicit content online, specifically on gonewild. The guy found out through Reddit, saw her posts, and confronted her. She didn't think it was cheating, and even suggested he join her for couple posts. He couldn't handle it and broke up. Now the question is if he's in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious what others think. The options are A for yes (author is in the wrong) and B for no.\n\nI need to analyze both sides. On one hand, the girlfriend's actions might be a dealbreaker for the guy. If he didn't know about her posts beforehand, maybe that's a red flag. But on the other hand, she might not have been aware of his feelings about this. Also, she didn't cheat; she just posted something online. The definition of cheating can vary, and if they hadn't discussed boundaries, maybe it's not clear.\n\nThe guy's reaction was breaking up because she wouldn't stop. Some might say that if she was willing to continue, then the relationship's values don't align. Others might argue that he needs to communicate better or set boundaries early. However, in relationships, both parties have expectations. If this was a dealbreaker and she didn't change her behavior, ending the relationship is a valid choice. \n\nBut was he wrong? If she didn't know he'd mind, then it's her fault for not knowing his feelings. However, if he never discussed it, maybe he's partially responsible. But the core issue is his decision to break up. Since he felt it was important to end the relationship over her posting, even if she didn't think it was cheating, he's acting on his own values. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Probably not. If the relationship's foundation requires mutual respect of boundaries, and he can't accept her actions, then ending it is his choice. Unless there was prior discussion where he made his stance clear, and she violated it, but in this case, it seems like a discovery after the fact. So, B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
