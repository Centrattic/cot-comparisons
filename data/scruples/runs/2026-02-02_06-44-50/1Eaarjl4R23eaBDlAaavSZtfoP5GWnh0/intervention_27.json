Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on gonewild is in the wrong. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend posted explicit content of herself on a site called gonewild, which is an NSFW platform. The guy found out through her Reddit history, got upset, confronted her, and then broke up because she didn't want to stop posting. He thinks it's cheating, but she says it's not because it's online. He says some hurtful things and ends the relationship.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are consent and communication. If the girlfriend was okay with posting her own content but didn't inform him, that's a communication issue. However, if the guy felt that her actions crossed a boundary he wasn't comfortable with, then he's within his rights to leave. The problem is whether the act of posting explicit content without his knowledge is a deal-breaker, and if breaking up is a valid response.\n\nIn a relationship, mutual respect and communication are key. If the girlfriend didn't discuss this with him beforehand, that's a problem. But the guy didn't talk to her about his boundaries either until he found out. So maybe he's responsible for not discussing this earlier. However, the act of posting explicit content without the partner's knowledge can be seen as a breach of trust, depending on the relationship's values. \n\nThe girlfriend's suggestion to do couple posts after the argument might have been a way to include him, but that could come off as dismissive of his feelings. The guy's reaction was intense, but if he felt it was cheating, even if she didn't, then his response is his way of handling it. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the relationship lacked communication from both sides, maybe he's not entirely at fault. But if he didn't express his boundaries earlier, maybe he shares some responsibility. However, the immediate reaction to break up might be a personal choice. Since he felt it was a deal-breaker, he's not necessarily wrong for ending it. The main issue is the lack of communication rather than who is right in the moment. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I'm a bit torn because both parties could have communicated better.\n"
