Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the user broke up with his girlfriend after finding out she posted something on Gonewild, which is a site for explicit content. The key points here are about trust, communication, and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the user found his girlfriend's explicit post on a public site. He felt betrayed because she shared private content without his consent. From his perspective, this might feel like a breach of trust. Even though she argues that since it's the internet, it's not cheating, he might see it as a violation of their relationship's boundaries. The girlfriend's suggestion to do couple posts together could have made the situation worse, as it might have felt dismissive of his feelings.\n\nNow, considering relationship norms, sharing explicit content without a partner's knowledge can be a sensitive issue. Even if there's no physical infidelity, emotional trust can be affected. The user's reaction\u2014breaking up\u2014might be seen as a personal choice based on his values and what he can handle in a relationship. However, some might argue that he should have communicated more before deciding to end the relationship, especially if there was a chance to discuss and set boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have her reasons for posting, such as personal expression or consent, but that doesn't necessarily negate the hurt caused to the partner. The user's decision to break up is a reaction to a situation where he feels his trust and comfort in the relationship were compromised.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Well, he's acting based on his feelings of betrayal. If the couple had different expectations and didn't communicate them beforehand, both could share some responsibility. But since the main issue is the girlfriend sharing content without consent, leading to the breakup, the user's action might be justified if he felt it was necessary for his own peace of mind and the relationship's health. However, others might say that he could have handled it differently. But given the information, it's a personal decision, and he might not be in the wrong for choosing to end a relationship where he felt uncomfortable.\n"
