Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author did the right thing here. The situation is that the author found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content on Gonewild, which is a site for such material. He confronted her, they had an argument, and he broke up with her because she didn't want to stop posting. Now he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was upset because he felt like she was cheating, even though she argued that posting online isn't cheating. From his perspective, finding out she was on a site like that, especially when he didn't know about it, could feel like a breach of trust. Cheating is subjective, and some people might not consider online activity cheating, but others do. If the relationship had an unspoken rule about such things, her actions might have broken that trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's side is that she was sharing content online, which she might have considered consensual if she was doing it voluntarily. She suggested couple posts, which implies she wanted to include him. The author's reaction was to end the relationship after an argument where he said some harsh things. Maybe he didn't give her a chance to explain or compromise. \n\nAlso, the author was defensive and ended things quickly. Communication is key in relationships, and maybe a more open discussion could have resolved the issue. However, the author's feelings of betrayal are valid if he considers online activities as part of the trust in the relationship. \n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong. If the girlfriend didn't hide her posts and he only found out by accident, maybe he overreacted. But if he felt it was a deal-breaker and she didn't want to stop, then ending the relationship might be his right. It's hard to say, but the answer might depend on mutual expectations. Since the author felt it was a deal-breaker, he might not be in the wrong. But if he didn't discuss it calmly first, maybe he is. However, the situation is complex, and both sides could have handled it better. But the answer is A or B. I think the author isn't in the wrong because he followed his feelings and boundaries, even if the breakup was sudden.\n"
