Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she posted on gonewild. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author found out that his girlfriend had a gonewild account and posted explicit content. He confronted her, they argued, and he broke up because she didn't want to stop. Now, he's wondering if he did the right thing. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know the opposite.\n\nLet me consider both sides. From the author's perspective, finding out about such posts can be a big trust issue. If the girlfriend was okay with sharing explicit content online, maybe she didn't see it as a problem, but the author felt it was a form of cheating. However, gonewild is a site for adult content, and using it doesn't inherently mean cheating unless there's a mutual agreement. The girlfriend's response that it's not cheating because it's online is a point to consider. Also, the author admitted he said some nasty things during the argument, which might indicate he acted out of anger rather than calm discussion.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend suggested making couple posts together, which could push the author's boundaries. If the relationship had a no-nsfw policy, then her actions might breach that. But the key is whether there was prior agreement. If they never discussed such boundaries, the author might have valid reasons for feeling betrayed. However, breaking up immediately after an argument without trying to resolve it might be hasty. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is wrong, maybe because the girlfriend didn't actually cheat, just posted online. But the author's comfort and trust in the relationship are important. If the girlfriend was open about her posts and the author wasn't, maybe the issue is about differing expectations. The author's decision to break up could be seen as his right to end the relationship if trust is broken. Still, the method of confrontation and immediate breakup might be problematic.\n\nSo balancing both sides, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship if it's a matter of incompatible values. However, the way he handled the confrontation could be improved. But since the question is about being in the wrong, and the girlfriend didn't cheat per se, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But also, considering that using gonewild is a personal choice and unless there was a prior agreement against it, the author's reaction might be harsh. Hmm, this is tricky. Need to decide based on typical AITA responses. Usually, people are AITA if their actions are unreasonable. Here, the author's breakup is a personal choice based on his discomfort, so maybe he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
