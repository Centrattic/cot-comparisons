Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her posting on gonewild is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The girlfriend posted explicit content online, specifically on a site like gonewild, which is known for adult content. The guy found out and broke up because he felt she was cheating, even though she argued that since it was the internet, it wasn't cheating. \n\nSo, the main issue here is about boundaries in a relationship. If both partners had agreed that sharing explicit content online was off-limits, then her actions would be a breach of trust. However, the scenario doesn't mention prior discussions about this. The guy's reaction is based on his personal feelings of betrayal, which is understandable. On the other hand, she might see it as her choice, especially if it's online and not involving physical interaction.\n\nThe guy confronted her, and she didn't take it seriously, even suggesting they make couple posts. That's a red flag because it shows she didn't respect his feelings. The breakup decision was based on his inability to accept this behavior. \n\nNow, whether he's in the wrong. If the relationship didn't have clear boundaries about such things, then both might share some responsibility. But since he felt it was a deal-breaker and she was unwilling to compromise, his decision to end things isn't necessarily wrong. However, maybe he should have discussed it more calmly first. But given the emotional reaction, breaking up might be a valid choice. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because he's justified in prioritizing his own comfort and boundaries in the relationship. Her actions crossed a line he found unacceptable, and he made a choice based on that.\n"
