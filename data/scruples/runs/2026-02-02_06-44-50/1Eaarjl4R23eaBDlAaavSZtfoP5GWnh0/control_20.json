Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who broke up with their girlfriend for her posting on Gonewild is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend found out that his girlfriend had posted explicit content of herself on a site like Gonewild. He confronted her, got angry, and ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop. She argued that since it's online, it's not cheating. \n\nI should consider the key points here. The main issue is whether sharing explicit content online constitutes cheating. The boyfriend felt betrayed and ended the relationship. The girlfriend's perspective is that online activity isn't cheating. \n\nCheating typically involves infidelity, which is engaging in sexual activity with someone else. However, sharing explicit images of oneself, especially without permission, can be a boundary violation in a relationship. The boyfriend might see this as a breach of trust, even if there's no physical or emotional infidelity. \n\nThe girlfriend's suggestion for the boyfriend to join her in posting as a couple could be a red flag, suggesting she's not willing to respect his boundaries. The boyfriend's reaction, while perhaps harsh, stems from feeling that his trust was broken. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend's approach\u2014acting in anger and ending the relationship abruptly\u2014could also be seen as extreme. Open communication might have been a better approach. But given the situation, if the boyfriend felt that this behavior was a deal-breaker, breaking up because of it isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nIt's important to note that consent and mutual boundaries are crucial in relationships. If the boyfriend didn't know about this activity and it made him uncomfortable, he's within his rights to end the relationship. The girlfriend's actions might not be cheating per se, but they could be seen as violating the trust and boundaries of the relationship. \n\nSo, the question is whether the boyfriend overreacted. Since the post was explicit and without his knowledge, and he found it upsetting, his decision to end the relationship isn't entirely his fault. The girlfriend might be in the wrong for not being transparent, but the boyfriend's response could be justified if he couldn't accept that behavior. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer might lean towards B (No), the author is not in the wrong, because he had the right to end the relationship based on his comfort level and the breach of trust he perceived.\n"
