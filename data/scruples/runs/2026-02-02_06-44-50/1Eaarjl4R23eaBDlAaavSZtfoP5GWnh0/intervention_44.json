Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on Gonewild is in the wrong. The situation involves him finding her explicit content on Reddit, which he clicked on by accident. They had a big argument, and he ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop posting such content. The user thinks the author might be in the wrong, but I need to figure out if that's the case.\n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. The girlfriend posted on Gonewild, which is an adult site. The author found her post accidentally while scrolling through Reddit. He confronted her, she argued it's not cheating since it's online, and he ended the relationship. Now, the author is questioning if he was right to break up.\n\nI need to think about the ethics and expectations in relationships. In a relationship, partners usually have certain boundaries. If one partner is uncomfortable with the other's behavior, that's a valid concern. However, the author's reaction might be too harsh. The girlfriend didn't cheat in the traditional sense; she posted content online. Whether that's considered cheating is subjective. Some people might see it as a breach of trust, others not. The author's immediate reaction was to end the relationship, which could be seen as extreme if there was a lack of communication or compromise attempted first.\n\nAlso, the author's approach was confrontational. He says he was \"aggy\" (aggressive?), which might have escalated the situation. The girlfriend suggested they do couple posts together, which could indicate she was trying to include him, but he didn't take that seriously and just ended things. Maybe there was a chance to talk about boundaries and reach a mutual understanding before breaking up.\n\nAnother angle: the author found the content by accident. He clicked on the post because he thought it was regular content. The girlfriend might not have intended for him to see it, but the fact that it's on a public platform (though maybe not intended for her partner to see) complicates things. However, the presence of her in explicit content, regardless of the platform, might be a deal-breaker for some people.\n\nBut does that make the author in the wrong? If the girlfriend was aware of his discomfort and still chose to post, then maybe she crossed a line. However, the author's decision to break up so quickly without trying to resolve the issue could be seen as hasty. Relationships require communication and effort from both sides. If he didn't address the issue calmly and instead reacted with anger, that could be problematic. On the other hand, if she was unwilling to compromise on something he found unacceptable, then ending the relationship is justified.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions could be viewed as a valid response to a breach of trust, especially if he had discussed his feelings about such content before. However, the way he handled the confrontation might have been harsh. The key is whether the breakup was a necessary step given the circumstances. If the author felt that her actions were a deal-breaker and she wasn't willing to change, he's not in the wrong. But if he didn't give her the chance to explain or adjust, maybe he is. Since the story is from his perspective, we don't know if he gave her a chance to discuss it further. The girlfriend's suggestion to do couple posts might have been a way to involve him, which he dismissed. So maybe he should have considered that approach instead of ending things immediately.\n"
