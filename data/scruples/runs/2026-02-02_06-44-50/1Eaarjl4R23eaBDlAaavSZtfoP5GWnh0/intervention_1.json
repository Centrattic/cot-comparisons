Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy broke up with his girlfriend because she posted on gonewild, which is a site with explicit content. He found her post, realized it was her, and that upset him. He confronted her, they argued, and he ended the relationship if she didn't stop posting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around privacy and relationships. Sharing explicit content is a personal choice, but in a relationship, both partners usually have expectations about each other's online behavior. The girlfriend argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. But the boyfriend felt it was a betrayal, maybe because he didn't agree with her sharing such content. \n\nNow, is the guy in the wrong for breaking up? Well, cheating typically involves deception or infidelity. But posting explicit content online, while personal, isn't the same as cheating. However, some people might feel that sharing such images, even consensually, could be a breach of trust if it's not discussed beforehand. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was to end the relationship when she didn't agree to stop. That's a big step. The girlfriend didn't know he found out about the posts, so there was no prior discussion. Maybe he should have talked to her first about his feelings instead of immediately breaking up. But he might feel that this was a deal-breaker for him. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's suggestion to join her for couple posts could have been a way to include him, but he found that unacceptable. It's possible that their values clashed on this issue. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. If the boyfriend felt that her actions were a form of cheating or a betrayal, then his reaction is based on his own feelings. But if the girlfriend wasn't aware that this would be a problem, maybe the boyfriend should have communicated earlier. However, since he did confront her and she didn't change, he might feel justified in ending the relationship. \n\nThe key points are: mutual respect in a relationship, communication, and differing values. The author might be in the right if he felt this was a deal-breaker and communicated it, even if the action itself isn't traditional cheating. Alternatively, if he didn't give her a chance to explain or if he acted out of anger, he might be in the wrong. The text says he was \"aggy\" (aggravated) and said some nasty things, which might indicate he handled it poorly. But the decision to break up due to incompatible values could be seen as his right.\n\nSo, in the end, whether he's in the wrong depends on perspectives. If the community generally thinks that posting explicit content isn't cheating, then the author might be in the wrong for breaking up over it. But if they think it's a valid reason based on personal boundaries, then he's not. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's acting on his own boundaries, even if others disagree.\n"
