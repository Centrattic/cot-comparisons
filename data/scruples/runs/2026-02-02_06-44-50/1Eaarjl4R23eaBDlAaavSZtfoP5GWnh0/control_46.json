Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content on a site called gonewild. He broke up with her because of it. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend was posting on gonewild, which is a site for adult content. The author found her posts, realized it was her, and then confronted her. She didn't think it was cheating because it was online, but he felt betrayed. He ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop posting.\n\nNow, thinking about cheating definitions. Cheating usually involves a breach of trust in a relationship. If the couple had an agreement that neither would post explicit content, then she violated that. But if there was no such agreement, it's more complicated. The girlfriend argues that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. However, the author felt it was a betrayal because of the content and the fact that it was her.\n\nAnother angle: privacy and consent. The author looked through her history without her knowledge. That's a breach of privacy. Even though he did it out of concern, it's still an invasion of her privacy. But then again, he had a right to be upset if he felt she was sharing intimate content without his consent. Wait, but she was the one posting it. So maybe he's in the right to feel betrayed if they had an understanding about such content.\n\nThe girlfriend suggested making couple posts together, which might indicate she's not willing to stop. The author left because she didn't agree to stop, which could be his decision based on his boundaries. If he felt that her actions crossed a line he couldn't accept, then ending the relationship is his choice. However, the method of confronting her might have been harsh, but the decision itself isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions were based on his feelings of betrayal and the lack of agreement on posting such content. The key is whether sharing explicit content online without the partner's consent is considered cheating. Some people might see it as a breach of trust even if it's not physical infidelity. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for breaking up because he set his boundaries and she didn't respect them. The answer is B.\n"
