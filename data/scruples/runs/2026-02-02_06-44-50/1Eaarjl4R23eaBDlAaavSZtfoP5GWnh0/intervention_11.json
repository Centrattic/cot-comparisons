Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy found out his girlfriend was posting on Gonewild, which is a site for NSFW content. He got upset, confronted her, and broke up with her. He's asking if he's in the wrong (AITA). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girlfriend was posting explicit content of herself on a site that's known for that. The guy found out through her Reddit history, clicked on a post and realized it was her. He confronted her, got angry, said some harsh things, and ended the relationship. The girlfriend argued that posting online isn't cheating. \n\nNow, the question is whether the guy was wrong to break up. Let's break it down. \n\nIn a relationship, trust and communication are crucial. If one partner is doing something that the other finds uncomfortable or unacceptable, it's important to discuss it. The guy's reaction is understandable if he felt violated or betrayed. However, breaking up immediately after an argument where both sides might have said hurtful things could be seen as impulsive. \n\nThe girlfriend's stance that internet posts aren't cheating might be a cultural or personal belief. Some people see social media or adult sites as private, but others might view it as a form of infidelity. It depends on the boundaries of the relationship. If they hadn't discussed this before, the guy might not have known it was a deal-breaker for him. \n\nAlso, the guy's actions: clicking on the post without her consent. That's a privacy issue. Even if he found it by accident, he didn't ask her permission to look through her history. That could be seen as invasive. However, given the context, he might have thought he was browsing normally and stumbled upon it. \n\nHe did confront her, which is a valid step. But his emotional response led to the breakup. If he had given her a chance to explain or set boundaries, maybe the outcome would be different. However, if she was insistent on continuing despite his objections, then his decision to leave might be seen as a way to protect himself. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he broke up without trying to resolve the issue through communication, maybe. But if her actions violated his trust and she refused to stop, then it's his right to end things. \n\nFactors to consider: Did he have prior knowledge of her posting? No. Did he handle it calmly? Not really, he was aggy. Did she respect his feelings? She suggested couple posts, which might have been dismissive. \n\nIn the end, whether he's in the wrong depends on relationship norms. If cheating means emotional or physical infidelity, but online sharing isn't traditionally seen as that, he might be overreacting. However, trust is personal, and if this breaches his trust, he's within his rights. \n\nI think there's a balance here. The guy's actions were reactive, but his feelings are valid. The girlfriend's actions might not be cheating by some standards, but they caused significant distress. So, maybe the guy isn't in the wrong because he stood up for his boundaries, even if the breakup was abrupt. Alternatively, he could have tried to work it out. \n\nBut given the information, the answer is likely B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's setting boundaries and prioritizing his comfort, even if the method was harsh.\n"
