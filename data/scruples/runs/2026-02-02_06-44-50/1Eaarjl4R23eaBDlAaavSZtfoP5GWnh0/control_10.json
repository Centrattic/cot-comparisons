Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after finding her on a GoWild post. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the girlfriend posting explicit content online. The author found her on a subreddit known for such content, which he found unacceptable. They had an argument, and he ended the relationship because she didn't agree that it was cheating and even suggested they do it together as a couple. \n\nNow, considering different perspectives. The author's perspective is that sharing explicit content, especially on a platform like GoWild, is a deal-breaker for him. He felt betrayed and couldn't reconcile with her continuing the behavior. On the other hand, the girlfriend's stance is that sharing such content online isn't cheating, which is a viewpoint some people hold, though others might disagree. \n\nCheating is often defined by both partners, right? So if one partner considers online activities as cheating and the other doesn't, it's a communication problem. But in this case, the author felt it was cheating. The fact that she didn't stop and even suggested they do it together as a couple might have pushed him to the breaking point. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Well, relationships require mutual respect and boundaries. If she agreed to stop, he might not have broken up. But she didn't, and he couldn't accept it. From a moral standpoint, the author's decision is based on his personal boundaries. However, the way he handled the confrontation\u2014getting \"aggy\" (aggressive) and saying nasty things\u2014could be seen as unfair. But the breakup itself is his choice based on his values. \n\nThe key point is whether the author had the right to end the relationship. Since he felt it was a betrayal and she didn't see it the same way, breaking up because of incompatible values isn't necessarily wrong. So, the answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong). But if the question is about the act of breaking up versus how he handled the argument, maybe A. However, the user is asking specifically about the author's action of breaking up because she posted on GoWild. \n\nIn many cases, people have different thresholds for what's acceptable. If the author's boundary was non-negotiable, then breaking up isn't in the wrong. So, B is more likely the correct answer here.\n"
