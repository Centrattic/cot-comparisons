Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person broke up with their girlfriend because they found her on a site called Gonewild, which is known for explicit content. The guy clicked on a post and realized it was his girlfriend. He confronted her, got into an argument, and ended things because she continued to post there. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Is sharing explicit content of oneself on a public site considered cheating? The girlfriend argued that since it's online, it's not cheating. But the guy felt betrayed. Different people have different boundaries. Some might see it as a violation of trust if the person is in a relationship and sharing without the partner's knowledge or consent.\n\nThe guy's reaction was to end the relationship when she didn't agree to stop. Is that fair? Well, if the girlfriend was okay with sharing explicit content and the guy wasn't comfortable with that, then he's within his rights to end it. But was there cheating involved? If she posted the content without intending to deceive and it's not part of an affair, maybe it's not cheating. However, the guy felt it was a betrayal, which is valid in terms of his emotions and their relationship's boundaries.\n\nThe key here is mutual consent and understanding of boundaries. If the girlfriend didn't hide other aspects of her life and the guy didn't discuss his discomfort beforehand, maybe the issue is that he didn't communicate his boundaries. But once he found out and chose to end the relationship, is that in the wrong? Probably not. People have the right to end relationships when their boundaries are violated. However, if the girlfriend didn't know it was a problem, maybe the guy should have addressed it earlier. But since he did confront her and she didn't stop, ending things makes sense.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends on whether sharing that content violates their agreed-upon boundaries. If they didn't discuss this before, maybe he's not in the wrong for ending it. But if she had no intention of hiding it and he didn't express his concerns, maybe he's being overly harsh. However, given the information, the answer is likely B (No), because he followed through after confronting her and she didn't meet his needs, so ending the relationship is acceptable.\n"
