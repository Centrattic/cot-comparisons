Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on GoneWild is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content online, specifically on GoneWild. He confronted her, they argued, and he ended the relationship because he felt it was a form of cheating, even though she didn't have a sexual relationship with someone else. The key points here are the definition of cheating, communication issues, and the sudden decision to break up.\n\nCheating typically involves infidelity, which is a physical or emotional affair outside the relationship. Posting explicit photos online, while potentially a privacy or trust issue, isn't traditionally considered cheating unless there's an agreement otherwise. The girlfriend argues that since it's the internet, it's not cheating, which might be her stance. However, the boyfriend felt violated, which is a valid emotional response. \n\nCommunication is a big factor here. They had an argument where the boyfriend was aggressive (\"aggy\") and said some hurtful things. The girlfriend suggested they could create couple posts together, which might indicate she didn't see it as a problem or wanted to include him. The boyfriend's reaction was immediate and decisive, ending the relationship without much discussion. \n\nNow, considering the boyfriend's actions: he broke up because of her online activity, which he perceives as a betrayal. But if there was no prior agreement about such content, his reaction might be abrupt. However, trust is crucial in relationships. If her actions made him uncomfortable and she was unwilling to stop, then his decision to end it could be seen as protecting his own feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, if he didn't discuss boundaries beforehand, he might have contributed to the issue. The fact that she was posting before he found out could mean she didn't consider how it would affect him. But he also had a right to feel upset. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If the girlfriend's actions violated his trust and he made it clear he couldn't accept it, then ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. But if there was no prior discussion about online behavior, he might have been too quick. However, given the emotional impact and the unwillingness of the girlfriend to stop, his choice could be justified. So, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
