Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author breaking up with his girlfriend after finding her posts on Gonewild, a pornographic forum. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author discovers his girlfriend has been posting explicit content online. He confronts her, they argue, and he breaks up because she refuses to stop. He's unsure if he did the right thing.\n\nNow, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants another perspective. In relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The girlfriend argues that posting on the internet isn't cheating, which is a point of contention. The author felt betrayed and ended things, which is his right, but is it wrong?\n\nFrom an ethical angle, does posting explicit content without the partner's knowledge breach trust? The author felt it was a dealbreaker. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she didn't see it as cheating, but the author did. The decision to end the relationship is personal, but was there a valid reason?\n\nThe author's actions were based on his feelings of betrayal. However, the girlfriend's actions might not be illegal or necessarily cheating, just a boundary he wasn't comfortable with. The question is whether the author overreacted. If the girlfriend was aware of the forum's nature and chose to post there, maybe it's her right. But the author's right to feel hurt is valid too.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship due to incompatible values. However, his approach (getting angry, saying nasty things) might be at fault, but the breakup itself is his choice. The answer might be B (No), because he's within his rights to end the relationship if it's a dealbreaker for him.\n"
