Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she posted something on gonewild. First, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe girlfriend was on a site called gonewild, which is a platform for adult content. The author found her posts there and realized she was the one posting. He confronted her, and she argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. The author felt betrayed, said some harsh things, and ended the relationship. He's now questioning if he was wrong.\n\nNow, the key points here. Cheating is typically about betrayal in a relationship, but definitions can vary. The girlfriend claims posting explicit content online isn't cheating. Some people might see it as a form of cheating, especially if it's about sharing intimate content without the partner's consent. Others might not, considering it personal choice unless there's a mutual understanding.\n\nThe author's actions: confronting her, getting angry, and breaking up. He was upset, which is understandable. But was he in the wrong? Well, if their relationship had boundaries about sharing content, and she violated them, then he's justified. However, if there were no such boundaries, maybe his reaction is overstepping.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend suggesting they post together implies she might have expected him to join in, which could be another point of conflict. The author's decision to end the relationship because she wasn't willing to stop might be based on his personal boundaries being crossed.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If they hadn't discussed what's acceptable regarding online content, the misunderstanding could be on both sides. But once the issue arose, the author's reaction of breaking up is his right, especially if he felt violated. However, some might argue that the breakup was too harsh without addressing the issue first. But given the emotional context, it's a personal decision.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong because he stood up for his boundaries. The girlfriend's actions breached those boundaries, and he ended the relationship to protect his own feelings. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
