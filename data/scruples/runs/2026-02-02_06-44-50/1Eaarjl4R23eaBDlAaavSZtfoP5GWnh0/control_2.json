Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy broke up with his girlfriend because he found out she was posting on gonewild, which is a site known for explicit content. He was scrolling through Reddit, clicked on a gonewild post, and realized it was his girlfriend. He confronted her, and she didn't think it was cheating because it's the internet. He felt she was being disrespectful or maybe even cheating, and they ended up breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he felt betrayed. Even though she wasn't physically cheating, posting explicit photos online might cross a line for him. He couldn't handle it emotionally and decided to end the relationship. On the other hand, the girlfriend's stance is that sharing such content online isn't cheating, which is her opinion, and she even suggested involving him in it as a couple. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong to break up. There's no clear legal or moral rule here. Relationships are based on mutual respect and boundaries. If the author felt that her actions violated their relationship's boundaries, then maybe he wasn't wrong to end it. However, some might argue that his reaction was harsh because she didn't engage in actual infidelity. \n\nBut here's the thing: everyone has different values. If the girlfriend agreed to post such content and the boyfriend didn't find out until later, there might be a communication issue. But if the boyfriend felt uncomfortable and she continued despite his feelings, then the breakup makes sense. The key here is whether the author's actions were justified given their agreed-upon boundaries. Since he confronted her and she didn't stop, ending the relationship could be seen as his right to protect his emotional well-being. \n\nAlso, she suggested he join her in couple posts, which might not align with his comfort zone. The author's decision to end things might be his way of setting a boundary. However, some might say he overreacted because sharing photos online isn't the same as physical cheating. But others would support his choice to leave if it made him unhappy. \n\nIn the end, it's subjective. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the scenario doesn't indicate any lies or coercion from the author's side, and he made his feelings known, it's possible he's not in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), but it's a bit of a gray area. However, given the context that he felt betrayed and she didn't respect his feelings, B seems more accurate here.\n"
