Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their girlfriend for posting on Gonewild is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content online and broke up with her because he felt it was like cheating. She argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating, and even suggested they do couple posts. He decided to end the relationship because she didn't want to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy felt betrayed and decided to end the relationship because he couldn't handle the idea of her sharing such content, which he equates to cheating. On the other hand, the girl might view her actions as her personal choice, especially since she's sharing on a platform that's for adult content. The key here is whether posting explicit material online constitutes cheating. Different people have different boundaries, and if this was established beforehand, the guy's reaction might be understandable. However, if there was no prior agreement, maybe the girl didn't realize it was an issue.\n\nThe guy acted on his feelings, which is valid, but he did confront her and gave her a chance to stop, which seems fair. She didn't want to stop and even suggested including him, which might have crossed a line for him. Breaking up because of a dealbreaker is not necessarily wrong. However, using harsh language during the confrontation could be seen as a mistake, but the core issue is about mutual respect and boundaries.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the guy's decision to end the relationship because of a boundary violation isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
