Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her posting on gonewild was in the wrong. The situation is that he found her on a site that's typically for explicit content. He felt it was cheating because she was using the internet, and he ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy felt betrayed because she was sharing explicit content online, which he considers cheating. But the girlfriend argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. There's a difference in values here. The guy values fidelity in a way that includes not sharing explicit content online, even if it's consensual. She, on the other hand, doesn't see it that way and even suggested he join her in sharing couple posts, which he found unacceptable.\n\nHe confronted her, got into an argument, said some harsh things, and then broke up. The question is whether he was in the wrong. If the relationship was built on mutual trust and communication, then maybe breaking up was a decision based on his personal boundaries. However, breaking up because of something that she didn't consider cheating could be seen as overreacting, especially if there was no prior agreement on internet activities.\n\nBut from the guy's perspective, if he felt it was a betrayal, then his reaction is justified. He had a right to his feelings and his boundaries. However, the way he handled it\u2014being aggressive, saying nasty things, and not giving her time to explain\u2014might have been problematic. But the core issue is whether the act itself was wrong in his eyes, given his values.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the act of posting explicit content online is cheating. Some people might say no, it's not cheating if it's just sharing and not involving others. Others, like the guy, might see it as a breach of trust. Since the question is whether he is in the wrong, if he genuinely believed it was cheating and couldn't reconcile that, then breaking up wasn't his fault. Therefore, he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
