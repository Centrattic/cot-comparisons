Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she posted on gonewild. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend found out that his girlfriend had posted explicit content of herself on a site called gonewild. He confronted her, they had an argument, and he ended the relationship. He's now wondering if he did the right thing.\n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong but is seeking a second opinion. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nTo analyze this, I should consider the key points. The girlfriend's actions: posting explicit content online. The boyfriend's reaction: breaking up because he felt it was equivalent to cheating. The girlfriend's defense: she argued that posting online isn't cheating. \n\nWhat's the standard here? Cheating typically involves a breach of trust in a relationship. However, sharing explicit content on the internet is different from physical infidelity. But in some relationships, even non-physical actions can be considered cheating if they violate the agreed-upon boundaries. \n\nThe boyfriend's perspective is that her online presence was a betrayal. The girlfriend, on the other hand, didn't see it that way. The breakup was because he couldn't accept her behavior. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the couple had no prior agreement about online activities, then the girlfriend might not have known that her actions would be a problem. However, once he confronted her and she didn't plan to stop, the boyfriend chose to end the relationship. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might have some accountability. The girlfriend made choices that her partner found unacceptable. The boyfriend made a decision based on his feelings of betrayal. \n\nBut is the author at fault? If he communicated his feelings and she didn't respect his boundaries, then he's acting within his right to end the relationship. Alternatively, if he overreacted without understanding her perspective, maybe he's in the wrong. \n\nHowever, the main issue is whether sharing explicit content online is considered cheating. Since definitions of cheating vary, if the boyfriend felt it was a violation, then his reaction is based on his own values. The girlfriend's suggestion that he join her for couple posts might indicate she didn't see it as problematic, but the boyfriend's decision to end it was his choice. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person acted out of proportion or without considering the other's perspective. Here, the author felt betrayed and made a decision to part ways, which is a personal choice. Unless there was some deceit (like her lying about her actions), the author's reaction seems within his rights. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong). However, there's a nuance here. If the author didn't have prior discussions about boundaries and reacted harshly without understanding her reasons, maybe A. But given the information, the author is justified in ending the relationship if he felt it breached trust, leading to B.\n"
