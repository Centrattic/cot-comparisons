Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend because he found out she was posting on GoWild, a site similar to Reddit but more explicit. He was upset and ended the relationship. Now he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The guy found his girlfriend's posts on a site that's for explicit content. He felt she was cheating, but she argued that since it's online, it's not cheating. The guy was in shock and couldn't sleep, confronted her, got into an argument, and decided to end the relationship because she didn't want to stop posting. His friends are upset with him, and he's unsure if he did the right thing.\n\nFrom a traditional perspective, cheating usually involves physical infidelity. However, some people might consider sharing explicit content as a form of emotional or virtual infidelity. The line here is blurry. The girlfriend argued that it's not cheating because it's online, but the guy felt betrayed. \n\nNow, the question is whether he was wrong to break up. If the relationship had prior agreements about online content and she violated that, then maybe he's justified. But if there were no such agreements, it's more complicated. The guy acted impulsively, maybe without fully discussing boundaries beforehand. He also admitted to saying nasty things during the argument, which isn't great. \n\nThe girlfriend suggested they could do couple posts together, which might imply she was open to continuing. The guy decided to end things immediately when she didn't agree to stop. Breaking up over this without prior discussion about boundaries could be seen as harsh. However, if this was a deal-breaker for him, then it's his right to end the relationship. \n\nBut the key point is whether the act of posting on GoWild constitutes cheating. Since it's not physical, it's more about mutual respect and agreed-upon expectations. If the guy felt deeply hurt by this, maybe he should have addressed it earlier instead of breaking up after an argument. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong if the relationship didn't have clear boundaries and he ended it without giving her a chance to explain or compromise. However, if this was a fundamental issue for him and he communicated it, then he's not in the wrong. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards him being in the right if the content posting was against his values and they couldn't compromise.\n"
