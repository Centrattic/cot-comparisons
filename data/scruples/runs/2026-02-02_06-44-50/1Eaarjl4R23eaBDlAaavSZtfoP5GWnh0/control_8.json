Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content on a site called gonewild. He broke up with her because he felt it was like cheating. She argued that since it's online, it's not cheating. He then ended the relationship when she didn't agree to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key points are: he found her posts by accident, she was posting explicit content online, and he felt betrayed. The question is whether breaking up was the right move.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are important. If something like this comes up, how both people handle it matters. The guy reacted by confronting her, which is understandable. But his friends are upset, which might indicate that his reaction was too harsh. \n\nNow, whether it's cheating online or not can be subjective. Some people might see sharing explicit content with others as a form of cheating, even if it's not in person. Others might not, depending on their values. The girl's suggestion for him to join in suggests she didn't see it as cheating and wanted to include him, but he didn't want to. \n\nThe guy's actions led to a breakup. Was he wrong? Well, if trust is broken, ending the relationship can be a valid choice. But if he acted out of anger without discussing it calmly, maybe that's where he's in the wrong. However, the user is asking if he's in the wrong for breaking up. If she was posting explicit content and he felt it violated their relationship, then his decision could be justified. \n\nBut maybe he should have talked about it first instead of immediately breaking up. However, given that she didn't stop, perhaps ending was necessary. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nConsidering both sides, the answer might be B (No), because he had a reason to feel betrayed, and if she continued after he asked her to stop, then breaking up is understandable. However, others might argue that he was too quick to end things without fully discussing. But based on the information given, the author's actions seem justified if trust was broken. So I'm leaning towards B.\n"
