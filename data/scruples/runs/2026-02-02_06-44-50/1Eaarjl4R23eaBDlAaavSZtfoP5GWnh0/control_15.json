Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about breaking up with a girlfriend after finding out she posted something on a site called gonewild. First, I need to understand the context.\n\nSo, the author found his girlfriend's post on gonewild, which is an online platform where people share explicit content. He was scrolling through Reddit, clicked on something, realized it was her, and then confronted her. The argument led to the breakup. The key issue here is whether his reaction was justified.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. The author felt betrayed and ended the relationship. Now, the question is if he's in the wrong. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, cheating typically involves physical or emotional infidelity outside the relationship. However, sharing explicit content online can be a gray area. Some people might see it as a violation of trust, especially if it's done without the partner's knowledge or consent. The girlfriend's suggestion to make couple posts together might imply that she wasn't against the idea, but the author was uncomfortable. \n\nThe author's reaction was to break up, which is a significant decision. But considering that he was upset and the argument turned into a major conflict, maybe his reaction is a personal choice. However, if there was no prior discussion about boundaries regarding online content, both parties might share some responsibility. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong because he felt betrayed and acted based on his feelings. On the other hand, if there were no clear boundaries set beforehand, maybe he should have communicated his discomfort earlier. But given the scenario, the immediate breakup after discovering this could be justified if it's a deal-breaker for him. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that the girlfriend should have respected his boundaries not to post such content. The key here is mutual consent and communication. If the girlfriend believed it wasn't cheating, but the author found it unacceptable, the conflict arises from differing expectations. \n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on cultural or personal beliefs about online content and cheating. Since he made a choice based on his comfort level and the girlfriend wasn't willing to compromise, the author might not be in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
