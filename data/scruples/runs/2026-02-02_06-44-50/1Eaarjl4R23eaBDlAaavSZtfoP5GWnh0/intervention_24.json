Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after finding her on a site called gonewild. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend posted explicit content online, which the boyfriend discovered. He felt betrayed and ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop posting. The key points here are consent, boundaries, and mutual respect in a relationship.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is based on feeling that her actions were a form of cheating, even though she argued that online actions don't count. He communicated his feelings, asked her to stop, and when she didn't, he broke up. His friends are upset, but he's not exposing her, which is considerate.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might believe that sharing explicit content online is her personal choice, especially if it's consensual. However, in a relationship, sharing such content without the partner's knowledge or consent can be a boundary crossed. The boyfriend had the right to express his discomfort and set boundaries. \n\nThe question is whether breaking up was the wrong move. Relationships require mutual respect for each other's boundaries. If the girlfriend was unwilling to respect his request to stop, then the breakup is a valid decision. The boyfriend isn't wrong for prioritizing his own comfort and values. However, if the content was something they had discussed and agreed upon beforehand, it might be different. But since there's no mention of prior discussion, it seems like a breach of trust. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because he acted based on his feelings and boundaries, and the breakup was a result of irreconcilable differences in their expectations.\n"
