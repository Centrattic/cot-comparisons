Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she posted on Gone Wild. First, I need to understand the situation properly. The key points here are that the girlfriend was on a gonewild post, which the author found out by accident. He was upset because he thought she was cheating, but she argued that online isn't cheating. Then she suggested they do couple posts, but he ended the relationship.\n\nSo, the main issues here are trust, definitions of cheating, and communication. The author found explicit content of his girlfriend, which he might feel is a violation of trust. He confronted her and felt she wasn't taking it seriously when she said it wasn't cheating. She then offered to include him in such posts, which he found unacceptable, leading to the breakup.\n\nI need to consider different perspectives. On one hand, sharing explicit content online can be a red flag for some people, especially if it's done without their partner's knowledge. The author felt betrayed, leading to emotional distress. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have considered it consensual and not cheating, and she might have thought the author would be okay with it if he found out. The fact that she suggested involving him could be seen as trying to include him, but that might have made things worse.\n\nAnother angle is communication. They had an argument where both said hurtful things. The author ended the relationship, which could be seen as a decision based on his personal boundaries. However, some might argue that breaking up immediately without trying to resolve the issue through better communication could be hasty. But if the author genuinely felt that this was a deal-breaker and she wasn't willing to respect his boundaries, then ending it might be his right.\n\nAlso, the definition of cheating varies. Some people consider sharing explicit content online as cheating, while others don't. It's subjective, but the author's comfort level is a significant factor here. Since the relationship became strained after the argument, the breakup might be a necessary step for the author to maintain his self-respect and emotional well-being.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship if her actions violated his boundaries. However, his approach\u2014confronting her late at night and being aggressive\u2014might not be the best way to handle it, but the final decision to break up is his to make. The girlfriend's willingness to continue posting despite his objection is a big issue here. If she wasn't willing to respect his feelings, then the breakup is justified.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because he acted based on his personal boundaries and the girlfriend wasn't respecting those boundaries. However, the way he handled the confrontation could be improved, but the decision itself isn't his fault.\n"
