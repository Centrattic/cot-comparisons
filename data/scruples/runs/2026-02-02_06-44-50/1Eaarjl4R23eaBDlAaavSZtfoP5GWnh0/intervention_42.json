Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend over her posting on Gone Wild is in the wrong. They provided the original AITA (Am I the Asshole) post, where the person explains finding their girlfriend's explicit photos online, confronting her, and ending the relationship because she didn't stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend posted explicit content on a site like Gone Wild, which is a platform for adult content. The boyfriend found her posts, felt betrayed, and ended the relationship because she continued to post. He argues that this counts as cheating, even though she says it's just the internet. \n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. From the boyfriend's perspective, seeing his partner's explicit photos publicly posted without his consent could be a huge violation of trust. Even if she claims it's not cheating, the act of sharing such content online might be seen as a breach of boundaries in the relationship. The boyfriend felt it was a deal-breaker and made a decision based on his discomfort and the emotional impact.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought that posting on such sites is a personal choice and doesn't involve her partner. She might not see it as cheating because there's no direct infidelity involved. However, the boyfriend clearly communicated that this was a problem for him, and she didn't agree to stop, which led to the breakup. \n\nThe question is whether the boyfriend was wrong to end the relationship. In relationships, boundaries are crucial. If the boyfriend communicated his concerns and the girlfriend didn't respect those boundaries, then the boyfriend is justified in ending things. Cheating isn't just about physical actions; it's about the trust and respect each partner has for the other. If the girlfriend's actions made him feel violated, then his decision to end the relationship could be seen as reasonable.\n\nHowever, another angle is that the boyfriend might have overreacted. If the girlfriend didn't consider it cheating, then maybe the boyfriend is imposing his own standards without fully understanding her perspective. But the key here is communication. The boyfriend did confront her and she didn't comply, so the breakup is a result of mutual disagreement on what constitutes cheating.\n\nIn summary, the boyfriend's decision to end the relationship because of a boundary violation he felt strongly about is not necessarily in the wrong. The girlfriend continued an activity that caused him significant distress, and he chose to end things when she didn't respect his boundaries. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
