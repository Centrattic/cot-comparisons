Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their girlfriend for posting on gonewild is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out that his girlfriend was posting explicit content online, specifically on gonewild. He confronted her, argued, and broke up because he felt like she wasn't respecting their relationship boundaries. She argued it wasn't cheating since it's the internet. \n\nSo, the key points here are consent and communication. The author didn't like the fact that she shared explicit content without his knowledge. In a relationship, sharing such content without the partner's consent can be a big deal. Even if it's online, the fact that she was using her real identity or recognizable details might be an issue. \n\nBut wait, she might have thought it was okay. Maybe she considered it a personal choice, and he didn't discuss boundaries beforehand. If they never talked about what's acceptable in terms of social media or online activities, then both could be at fault. However, the author's reaction was to break up after an argument. \n\nIs it right for him to end the relationship because of this? If she was unaware that he would take it as a deal-breaker, maybe he should have communicated his boundaries earlier. But on the other hand, sharing explicit material without consent can breach trust. \n\nThe girlfriend's suggestion that he join her for couple posts might have pushed him over the edge. That could imply she didn't take his feelings seriously. \n\nSo, who's in the wrong? If the author didn't set clear expectations about online behavior, maybe he shares some responsibility. But if she violated his trust by sharing explicit content without his knowledge, then her actions were wrong. The breakup decision might be justified if trust was broken. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he broke up after finding out something he considered a betrayal, it's a personal choice. However, if he didn't address it sooner, maybe he's not entirely wrong. \n\nI think the main issue is mutual communication. The author might not be in the wrong if he had valid reasons and discussed them, even if the breakup was sudden. But if he didn't give her a chance to explain or resolve it, maybe there's room for criticism. \n\nOverall, I lean towards the author not being in the wrong because sharing explicit content without consent is a breach of trust, especially if it's recognizable. The fact that she continued and even suggested involving him in such posts shows she didn't prioritize his feelings. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
