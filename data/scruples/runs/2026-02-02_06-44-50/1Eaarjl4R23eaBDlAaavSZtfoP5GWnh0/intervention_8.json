Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he found out his girlfriend was posting on gonewild, which he considered cheating. He confronted her, got into an argument, and broke up with her because she didn't want to stop. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Gonewild is a website where people share explicit content, often anonymously. The girlfriend was posting there, and the author found out. He felt betrayed and ended the relationship. She argued that since it's online, it's not cheating. \n\nNow, cheating typically involves infidelity, which is about being unfaithful to a partner. The key here is whether sharing explicit photos online counts as cheating. Some people might see it as cheating if they agreed not to share such content without the partner's consent. Others might not, especially if it's just posting without engaging with others. The girlfriend's stance is that the internet isn't cheating, which the author disagrees with.\n\nThe author's reaction was to end the relationship because she didn't agree to stop. He might feel that her actions breached trust. However, the issue here is whether his reaction was justified. He admits he said some nasty things during the confrontation, which could indicate he overreacted. Also, breaking up immediately might be a hasty decision without resolving the issue.\n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend was comfortable with online sharing and the author wasn't, maybe there was a miscommunication about boundaries from the start. The author could have discussed his feelings earlier instead of confronting her after the fact. But once he found out, his right to be upset is valid if he felt it was cheating. Still, handling it by breaking up without giving her a chance to change might be harsh, especially if there's no mutual agreement on what constitutes cheating.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the couple didn't have a prior agreement about online boundaries, both might share some responsibility. The author's immediate breakup could be seen as extreme, but his feelings are valid if he considered her actions cheating. However, his communication during the argument was aggressive, which isn't healthy. \n\nIn summary, it's a bit of a gray area. If the author believed it was cheating and communicated that, but the girlfriend didn't see it that way, both have valid perspectives. The author might not be in the wrong if he felt wronged, but his handling of the situation (aggressive behavior, quick breakup) could be seen as his fault. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer depends on whether the action of posting on the site is considered cheating. If the community or common opinion leans towards it not being cheating, then the author might be in the wrong for breaking up over it. But if people see it as cheating, then he's justified. Since the user thinks he's in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the situation given. The fact that she was posting without his knowledge and he felt betrayed might make him not at fault, but the way he handled it could be problematic. Hmm.\n"
