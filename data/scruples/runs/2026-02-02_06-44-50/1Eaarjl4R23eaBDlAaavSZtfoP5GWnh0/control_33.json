Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on Gonewild is in the wrong. The scenario is presented as an AITA (Am I the Asshole) question.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The man found out that his girlfriend had posted explicit photos of herself on Gonewild, a site known for user-submitted content. He confronted her, she argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating, but he felt betrayed and ended the relationship. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, sharing explicit content without consent is generally considered wrong. However, in this case, the girlfriend might have posted the content herself, so she had consented to sharing it. But the issue here is about trust and boundaries in a relationship. If the girlfriend was okay with sharing such content online, but the boyfriend wasn't comfortable with it, that's a conflict of values or expectations.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was to break up, which is his right if he feels that this is a deal-breaker. On the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective is that since it's online and not related to cheating, it's not an issue. But the boyfriend felt that this was a breach of trust because he didn't know about it and it made him feel like she was being unfaithful in some way, even if she wasn't.\n\nNow, considering societal norms, many people might view sharing explicit photos online as a personal choice, but when it comes to a relationship, both partners should agree on what's acceptable. The boyfriend didn't discuss this with her beforehand, so he might have had different expectations. However, once he found out and it caused him significant distress, ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong because he can't be in a relationship where this is a problem for him.\n\nThe key factors here are consent (she posted her own content), communication (they didn't discuss boundaries), and the impact on their relationship. Since she continued to post despite his request to stop, and he felt that he couldn't continue the relationship, his decision to break up isn't necessarily the wrong choice. However, whether he's in the wrong depends on whose perspective you take. If she felt that her actions were within her rights and he didn't give her a chance to explain or compromise, maybe he's being too harsh. But if he felt deeply betrayed and couldn't move past it, then he's not in the wrong for ending things.\n\nIn AITA terms, the answer usually hinges on whether the person did something to deserve the situation. Here, the boyfriend didn't do anything wrong; he's responding to his girlfriend's actions. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
