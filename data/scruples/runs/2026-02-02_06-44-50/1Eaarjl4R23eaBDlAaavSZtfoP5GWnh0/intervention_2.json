Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after discovering her posts on gonewild. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend posted nude photos on gonewild, a site known for adult content. The author found these posts and felt betrayed, leading to a breakup. The key points are: the author felt it was cheating, the girlfriend argued that online activity isn't cheating, and the author broke up when she didn't agree to stop.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. What constitutes cheating can be subjective. Some people view sharing explicit photos online as cheating because it's a form of intimacy with others. Others might not, especially if there's no physical interaction. The girlfriend's stance is that it's just the internet, so she doesn't see it as cheating. But the author clearly does. \n\nCommunication is crucial here. The author confronted her, but the argument escalated. The author's reaction was intense, leading to the breakup. The girlfriend even suggested they do couple posts, which might indicate she didn't think it was a big deal. However, the author felt strongly enough to end the relationship.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, relationships are about mutual respect and boundaries. If they had different boundaries regarding online activity, that should have been discussed earlier. The author might have felt blindsided, but did he address this issue before? If not, maybe he's reacting in a way that's justified for his personal beliefs. However, breaking up immediately without trying to resolve the issue might be hasty. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend was aware of the potential for discomfort and still chose to post, she might have her own responsibilities. The author's decision to end things because she wouldn't stop could be his right if it's a dealbreaker. \n\nBut I need to consider if there's a gray area. Did the author have prior knowledge about her posting habits? If not, then his reaction is a valid response based on his values. If he didn't set boundaries beforehand, maybe the issue is that both didn't communicate their expectations. \n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on their established boundaries. If they didn't discuss such things before, both might share some responsibility. However, since the author felt betrayed and couldn't reconcile their differences, his decision to break up might be justified. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he acted based on his values and boundaries in a situation where there was a lack of prior communication about online activities.\n"
