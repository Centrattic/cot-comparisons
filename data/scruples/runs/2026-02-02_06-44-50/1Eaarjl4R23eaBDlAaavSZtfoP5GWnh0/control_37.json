Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on Gonewild is in the wrong. The situation involves him finding her NSFW posts on a site, which he didn't realize were hers until later. He felt cheated even though she argued it wasn't cheating because it's online. He reacted strongly, called her out, and ended the relationship when she didn't want to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is whether sharing explicit content online counts as cheating. The girlfriend's stance is that since it's on the internet and not with a real person, it's not cheating. The author disagrees, feeling it's a betrayal. \n\nNow, relationship boundaries vary. What one person finds acceptable, another might not. The author clearly felt violated, even if it wasn't a physical infidelity. Emotional trust is a big part of relationships. If the girlfriend was sharing intimate content without his knowledge, that could be a breach of trust for him.\n\nBut then, the author's reaction might be seen as overzealous. He admitted to being \"aggy\" and saying nasty things. Ending the relationship immediately might be impulsive. Communication could have been attempted before breaking up. However, if the girlfriend was insistent on continuing the posts, the author might have felt justified in choosing to end the relationship to protect his own emotional well-being.\n\nAnother angle: The girlfriend's actions. Posting explicit content online can have consequences beyond the relationship. It might affect her privacy, reputation, and safety. The author might have valid concerns about her sharing personal content without his consent, even if she isn't cheating. In that sense, the author is acting to protect the relationship's integrity.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? If the couple had discussed boundaries beforehand, maybe. However, since they didn't, the author's reaction is based on his personal feelings. It's a tough call. Some might argue that he overreacted, while others say he's right to prioritize his comfort. Since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether his response was proportionate and if there was prior agreement on such matters.\n\nIn conclusion, without prior discussions, the author's decision to end the relationship is his choice based on his values. He's not necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing his emotional needs, even if others might see it differently.\n"
