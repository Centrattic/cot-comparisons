Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who broke up with their girlfriend for posting on gonewild is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation. \n\nFirst, the user found their girlfriend's post on a site like Reddit's gonewild, which is known for explicit content. The girlfriend argues that since it's online, it's not cheating. The user took the relationship seriously enough to confront her and eventually break up when she didn't agree to stop. The main question is whether the user was wrong to do that.\n\nLet me think about the key points. Consent and communication are big factors here. The girlfriend posted explicit content, which might be a red flag in a committed relationship. The user felt that this was a form of betrayal, even if it wasn't physical cheating. But is sharing explicit photos on the internet considered cheating? That's subjective. Some people might see it as a breach of trust, especially if it was done without the partner's knowledge or consent. Others might argue that since there's no physical infidelity, it's not cheating. \n\nThe user confronted her, and there was an argument where both sides said harsh things. The girlfriend suggested they do couple posts together, which the user didn't like. The user then decided to end the relationship because the girlfriend didn't want to stop posting. \n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationship expectations, sharing explicit photos online can be a deal-breaker for some. If both partners had discussed boundaries beforehand, maybe this situation could have been avoided. But in this case, the user only found out after the fact. The girlfriend might not have realized the user would take it so seriously. However, her argument that \"it's the internet, so it's not cheating\" might not hold weight if the user feels violated. \n\nAlso, the user's reaction was to break up rather than try to work through the issue. But they did confront her first, which is a valid step. If the girlfriend was willing to continue the behavior despite the user's discomfort, then the user's decision to end the relationship is about personal boundaries. \n\nSo, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong because they addressed the issue directly and decided that the relationship wasn't compatible with their values. However, the girlfriend might also have a point if she didn't see the online activity as cheating. But since the user is the one who ended it based on their own boundaries, they aren't the asshole here. The answer would be B, No.\n"
