Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she posted on gonewild. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. The girlfriend posted explicit content on a site called gonewild, which the author discovered. He confronted her, and she argued that since it was online, it's not cheating. The author then decided to break up because she didn't plan to stop posting, and he felt betrayed. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nSo, the main points here are about boundaries in a relationship, trust, and what constitutes cheating. The author's perspective is that seeing his girlfriend's explicit content online felt like betrayal, leading to the breakup. The girlfriend's stance is that since it's on the internet and not with someone else, it's not cheating. \n\nI need to consider cultural norms and relationship expectations. In many relationships, sharing explicit content, especially on public forums, can be a deal-breaker for some people. The author might have had different boundaries than his girlfriend. The key here is whether the author overreacted or if his reaction was justified based on their relationship's terms.\n\nThe girlfriend suggesting couple posts might imply she saw sharing such content as a way to enhance their relationship, but the author clearly felt violated. It's possible that there was a miscommunication about expectations regarding privacy and boundaries. \n\nIf the author had discussed his discomfort with online sharing before this incident, maybe the outcome would have been different. However, since he discovered it without prior conversation, his reaction might be seen as his boundary being crossed. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might not realize the significance of her actions to her partner. Some might argue that the author should have communicated his boundaries earlier. However, in this case, the discovery led to a breakup, which is a significant decision. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend didn't understand that sharing explicit photos online could be a deal-breaker, then the author's reaction might be justified. But if he didn't set those boundaries from the start, maybe he's partially at fault. However, considering the context, the author's feelings of betrayal are valid, and acting on those feelings to protect himself isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person acted reasonably given their perspective. Since the author felt cheated and couldn't reconcile the differing views, breaking up might be seen as his right. So, the answer might lean towards B (the author is not in the wrong). But I need to be careful here. Some might say that not discussing boundaries upfront makes him partially responsible, but in this case, the girlfriend's actions clearly violated his trust once he found out. Therefore, the author's decision to end the relationship is a personal choice based on his values, and he's not in the wrong for that.\n"
