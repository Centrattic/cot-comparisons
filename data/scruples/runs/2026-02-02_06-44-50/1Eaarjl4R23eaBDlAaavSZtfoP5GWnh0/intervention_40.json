Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she posted on Gonewild. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content of herself online, specifically on a site like Gonewild, which is known for explicit material. He was upset, argued with her, and eventually broke up because she didn't want to stop. She claimed that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. He felt like she was being dishonest or not respecting their relationship boundaries.\n\nNow, determining if he's in the wrong. The key points are about mutual expectations in the relationship. Did they have prior discussions about sharing explicit content online? If they didn't, then maybe both are at fault. The girlfriend might not have realized that posting such content was an issue for him. On the other hand, the guy found out later and reacted strongly. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. If the girlfriend didn't inform him about her intent to post explicit material, that could be a problem from his perspective. However, unless they had an explicit agreement that she wouldn't do that, it's debatable. Some people might see sharing nude photos as not cheating, especially if it's consensual and not with others. But the guy felt betrayed, which is a valid emotional response.\n\nThe guy's reaction: he confronted her, got angry, and then broke up when she didn't agree to stop. He might be in the right if he felt that her behavior violated his trust or made him uncomfortable. However, breaking up over this without prior discussion could be seen as abrupt. Did he give her a chance to explain? She suggested couple posts, which might imply she didn't see it as a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend was aware of his possible disapproval but continued, she might be at fault. However, the question is about the guy's actions. If he didn't communicate his boundaries earlier, then he might share some responsibility. But given that he was shocked and upset, and the breakup happened after a conflict, it's a bit of a gray area.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, often both parties have some fault. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The guy ended the relationship because he couldn't accept her actions. If the relationship was supposed to be exclusive and monogamous in terms of sharing explicit content, then he's justified. However, if it's a matter of differing values, then it's a mutual decision. The answer likely depends on whether there was an unspoken agreement or not. Since the girlfriend didn't see it as cheating, maybe the guy overreacted. But if he felt it was a deal-breaker, then he's not wrong. So, it's a bit of both. However, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. The system needs to decide A or B. Since the answer is binary, perhaps B (No) because he made a decision based on his comfort and boundaries, even if it was sudden. But if he didn't communicate his boundaries beforehand, maybe A. But without prior discussion, both are at fault. The question is, is the author in the wrong? The answer is probably a 50-50. But the system needs to pick one. In AITA, sometimes the person who ends the relationship over a deal-breaker isn't in the wrong. So maybe B (No). However, if he didn't talk about this first, maybe A. But in this case, he found out through her posts, and she didn't know he was upset. Since the post is asking if he's in the wrong, and the options are A or B, the answer is likely B (No) because he acted based on his feelings of betrayal and couldn't reconcile the difference, which is a valid reason to end a relationship. However, the initial assumption is that the user thinks he's in the wrong. So, the correct answer might depend on the cultural context and personal values. But given the information, the author isn't in the wrong if he felt it was a deal-breaker. Therefore, answer B.\n"
