Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her posting on Gonewild is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation properly. The girlfriend and boyfriend were in a strong relationship until she posted something on Gonewild, which he discovered. He was upset because he felt she was being unfaithful, even though she argued that it wasn't cheating since it's online. He ended the relationship because she wouldn't stop posting, and now he's questioning if he did the right thing.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether sharing explicit content online constitutes cheating or betrayal. The girl's argument is that it's just the internet, so it's not cheating. The boyfriend's perspective is that it's a form of infidelity. \n\nFrom a relationship ethics standpoint, cheating is typically defined as engaging in sexual activity with someone else. However, sharing explicit photos or videos online can be seen as a breach of trust, even if there's no physical interaction. The boyfriend might feel that this behavior is dishonest or that it violates their relationship boundaries. \n\nThe girl's suggestion that he join her for couple posts might have added to his discomfort, making him feel like she wanted to involve him in something he found unacceptable. \n\nIt's important to consider communication in relationships. The boyfriend's initial reaction was to confront her, leading to an argument where he said some harsh things. Ending the relationship after a heated argument might have been a result of not having a calm discussion about their boundaries beforehand. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend's decision to break up was based on her unwillingness to stop an activity he found unacceptable. If the girl continued to post despite his objections, he felt that staying in the relationship was not viable for him. \n\nIn many relationships, trust and mutual respect are key. If one partner's actions are causing significant emotional distress, it's reasonable for the other partner to seek to end the relationship. The question of right or wrong can be subjective here. \n\nIn some contexts, sharing explicit content without the partner's consent can be considered a privacy violation. But in others, especially if both partners are comfortable with it, it's not an issue. The key is whether there was a clear agreement on such activities. \n\nThe boyfriend may have overreacted by breaking up immediately after a confrontation, but his feelings are valid if he felt betrayed. The girl's stance that it's not cheating might not align with his definition of fidelity. \n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the agreed-upon boundaries in the relationship. If there was no prior discussion about online activities, then both could be at fault. However, the boyfriend had the right to set his boundaries and make decisions based on his comfort level. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he acted based on his feelings and the lack of mutual agreement on this issue.\n"
