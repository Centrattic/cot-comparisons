Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on gonewild is in the wrong. He found her on a site with explicit content and ended the relationship because he felt it was cheating, but she didn't agree. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend wasn't cheating in the traditional sense\u2014she wasn't having physical affairs. But she was posting explicit content online, which the boyfriend found unacceptable. Different people have different boundaries in relationships. Some might find online activity like that a deal-breaker, others not. \n\nThe key here is whether the boyfriend overreacted. He did confront her, and she didn't see it as cheating. He then broke up because she didn't agree to stop. Was that an overreaction? If their relationship had established boundaries about online behavior, then the girlfriend might be wrong for violating them. But if they hadn't discussed this before, the boyfriend might be overstepping by ending the relationship based on his own discomfort without prior communication.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's suggestion to do couple posts could imply she's inviting him to participate, which he might find uncomfortable. However, the act of posting explicit content, even consensually, can be a personal boundary issue. The boyfriend's reaction is based on his feelings about privacy and fidelity in the relationship. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. The boyfriend acted on his feelings but might not have considered if the relationship had different expectations. The girlfriend might not have realized how her actions were affecting him. Since both parties had different views on what constitutes cheating, the breakup is a result of incompatible values. So, neither is entirely in the wrong, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong specifically. Given that he ended the relationship due to her actions, and given that her actions were consensual and online, some might see his reaction as hasty. However, others would support his decision to leave if it goes against his comfort. The answer might hinge on whether prior expectations were set. Since they didn't have that conversation, maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong.\n"
