Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with a girlfriend because she posted on Gonewild. The author found her post on a site typically associated with adult content, which made him feel she was cheating. They argued, he said some harsh things, and then broke up. The girlfriend argued that internet activity isn't cheating, and even suggested making couple posts together. The author ended the relationship when she didn't stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Gonewild is a site that hosts explicit content, so posting there could be seen as a breach of trust. But the girlfriend's perspective is that she didn't think it was cheating. That's a key point. The author might have different boundaries about what constitutes cheating. But does that make him right to break up?\n\nThe author reacted strongly, maybe even immediately. He says he said some nasty things during the argument. That could indicate he acted out of anger. Also, the fact that she suggested making couple posts might show she didn't take the issue seriously. However, mutual agreement on boundaries is important in relationships. If the author felt uncomfortable with her posting, maybe he should have discussed it sooner rather than confronting her after the fact.\n\nAnother angle: the author found the post by accident. Did she know he would see it? Maybe not. But intent matters less if the action causes harm. If the author felt cheated, even if she didn't, the emotional impact is real. However, breaking up immediately after a heated argument could be seen as impulsive. Was there a chance to talk it through without ending things? \n\nThe girlfriend's stance that internet isn't cheating is a common debate. Some people see online activity as part of cheating, others don't. Without prior discussion about boundaries, it's a gray area. The author's reaction might be based on his own values, but ending the relationship might be a strong response unless there were other issues.\n\nAlso, the author's actions\u2014texting her the next day in a confrontational way\u2014could have escalated the situation. Maybe approaching the conversation with more calmness could have led to a different outcome. But if he felt betrayed, that's a valid emotion. Still, the immediate breakup might be harsh if she didn't intend to hurt him.\n\nIn the end, it's about mutual respect and communication. If the author didn't discuss his boundaries beforehand, he might share some responsibility. But if the girlfriend posted explicit content without considering his feelings, she's also at fault. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he made a unilateral decision to break up after a conflict without perhaps giving her a chance to change or explain, maybe he's not entirely wrong. But if he could have handled it differently, perhaps he's partially at fault too. But given the options are A or B, and the user thinks he's in the wrong, I need to decide if the answer is A or B. Considering all factors, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong) because he acted based on his feelings of betrayal, even if the communication could have been better. But others might argue he should have handled it differently, so it's a bit of a toss-up. But the main point is whether he was wrong. Since he felt it was a betrayal and ended the relationship, which is his right, maybe he's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
