Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's look at this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she posted on Gonewild. So, first, I need to understand the key points here.\n\nThe author found a Gonewild post that his girlfriend was in. He says he clicked on it by accident, not realizing it was her at first. Then, upon realizing, he confronted her the next day. He felt like it was cheating because she was posting explicit content online. She responded that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. He got upset, said some harsh things, and ultimately broke up with her because she didn't agree to stop posting. He's now questioning if he was in the right to do that.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The possible perspectives here are about consent, trust, and boundaries in a relationship. The key issue is whether sharing explicit images on a public or semi-public platform constitutes cheating. The girlfriend argues it's not cheating because it's online, while the author feels it is.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, cheating typically involves a betrayal of trust, which can include actions that go against agreed-upon boundaries. If the couple hadn't discussed this beforehand, there might be ambiguity. However, the author's reaction suggests that he found this behavior unacceptable. Breaking up because of a partner's actions that he perceives as cheating could be seen as his right, especially if he's not comfortable with it. On the other hand, if there was no prior discussion about such activities, maybe the author should have addressed it earlier rather than ending things abruptly after an argument.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The fact that he ended the relationship because of her actions, even if she didn't see it the same way, might be seen as his choice. However, if there was no prior agreement on boundaries regarding online content, maybe the author could have handled it differently. Alternatively, if the girlfriend was open about her actions and he didn't like it, then his decision to leave might be justified.\n\nAnother angle is the act of confronting her the next day and escalating the argument. He admits he said some nasty things, which might have contributed to a heated argument. Ending the relationship in the heat of the moment could be seen as hasty. However, the core issue is whether her actions cross a line he's unwilling to accept. If that's the case, then he's not in the wrong for ending it if her behavior is incompatible with his values.\n\nSo, considering these points, the answer might hinge on whether the act of posting explicit content is considered cheating. If it's not cheating by the girlfriend's definition, but the author finds it unacceptable, then he's not in the wrong for leaving. However, if the breakup was impulsive or without prior communication about expectations, that could be a factor. But given the scenario, the author's decision to end the relationship because of a dealbreaker he had is likely not wrong, making answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong) the choice.\n"
