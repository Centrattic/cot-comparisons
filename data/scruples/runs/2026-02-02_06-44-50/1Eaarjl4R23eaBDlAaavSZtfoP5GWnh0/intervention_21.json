Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The situation is about a guy breaking up with his girlfriend because she posted something on GoneWild, which he found out by accident. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The guy was scrolling Reddit, clicked on a post, found out it was his girlfriend on a site that's known for explicit content. He got upset, confronted her, she said it wasn't cheating because it's online. He ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop doing that. His friends are upset with him.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user initially thought he is, but I need to make my own assessment. Let's break it down.\n\nThe girlfriend's action: posting on a site that's associated with explicit content. This could be a breach of privacy or trust, depending on what the couple had agreed upon. However, the girlfriend argues that online activity isn't cheating. But some people might consider sharing explicit photos without consent as cheating, even online. But it's a gray area and depends on the relationship norms.\n\nThe guy's reaction: He got angry, said some harsh things, and broke up. He didn't immediately confront her, waited until morning. But he felt it was a betrayal. However, was confronting her the right approach? Also, she suggested he join her in couple posts, which might have been a joke or a way to de-escalate. \n\nIs the guy in the wrong? Well, he ended the relationship because of her actions. If the couple never discussed boundaries around sharing explicit content, then it's unclear who's at fault. The guy might feel wronged, but if there was no prior agreement, he might overreact. However, if she was sharing explicit photos of herself online without considering his feelings, that could be a breach of trust. On the other hand, he could have addressed it with her first instead of immediately breaking up. \n\nAnother angle: The guy found out through her own history, so maybe he violated her privacy by looking through her phone or history. If he did, that's a problem. But the story doesn't mention that explicitly. He says he looked through her history and saw it was her. Maybe he had access to her phone, which could be an issue. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's response that it's not cheating because it's online might be her defense, but some people might disagree. The guy has the right to feel hurt, but breaking up immediately without discussion could be seen as harsh. However, if this is a deal-breaker for him, then it's his choice. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's subjective. If the guy never expressed his boundaries and she didn't know posting GoneWild was an issue, then maybe he's not wrong. But if he's upset about her sharing explicit content, he has the right to end the relationship. However, the way he confronted her (being aggressive) might be where he's at fault. But the core issue is whether sharing such content is cheating. \n\nI think the answer depends on cultural or personal beliefs. In many relationships, sharing explicit photos without consent is considered cheating. But the girlfriend might not see it that way. The guy's actions in ending the relationship are his choice, but if he didn't communicate his boundaries first, maybe he's at fault. However, in the situation, he did confront her, though with aggression. \n\nSo, considering all that, I'm leaning towards the author (the guy) is not in the wrong because he's ending something that he found unacceptable, even if the justification is debatable. But if the girlfriend didn't know it was a problem, maybe he should have talked about boundaries first. However, in the end, it's his choice to end the relationship. So the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
