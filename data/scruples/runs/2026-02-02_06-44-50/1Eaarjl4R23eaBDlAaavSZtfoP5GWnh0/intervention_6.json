Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the guy found out his girlfriend had posted explicit content on Gonewild, a website known for adult content. He broke up with her over it. Now he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user says he clicked on a Gonewild post and realized it was his girlfriend. The key point here is whether posting explicit photos online is considered cheating. The girlfriend argues that since it's the internet and not a physical affair, it's not cheating. But the author felt betrayed and ended the relationship.\n\nI should think about consent and boundaries. Did the girlfriend know this could be an issue? If she posted the photos without discussing it with him and without his consent, that might be a problem. However, if she had mentioned it before and he was okay with it, that's different. The scenario doesn't mention prior discussion, so maybe it's a surprise to him.\n\nAlso, the fact that she suggested making couple posts together could be a red flag. Maybe she was encouraging him to participate, which might have crossed the line. But if he felt uncomfortable with that, it's valid to have boundaries.\n\nAnother angle is the definition of cheating. Some people consider sharing explicit content on the internet as infidelity because it's a form of emotional betrayal. Others don't, depending on the relationship's norms. The author felt it was cheating, so his reaction is based on his personal beliefs.\n\nHe acted impulsively after a fight, sending a text and breaking up. Was that too hasty? If they had a discussion to understand each other's perspectives instead of immediately breaking up, maybe the relationship could have been salvaged. But if he felt his trust was broken, ending it might be necessary for him.\n\nThe author's friends are upset, which could indicate that his reaction is seen as harsh. However, he's not the one in the public eye; it's his girlfriend who posted the content. He might be protecting her by not exposing her, which is a responsible move.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the girlfriend didn't hide her posts and believed it wasn't cheating, but the author felt it violated their relationship, both are in their own right. The author has the right to his boundaries. However, the way he handled it\u2014by immediately breaking up without communication\u2014might be seen as harsh. But if the core issue is about mutual respect and boundaries, he's justified in ending the relationship if her actions violated his trust.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer hinges on whether the girlfriend's actions were a breach of trust from the author's perspective. Since the author felt it was cheating and couldn't reconcile that, he's not necessarily in the wrong.\n"
