Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy broke up with his girlfriend because she had a post on Gonewild, which is a site known for explicit content. He found her post, realized it was her, got upset, confronted her, and then ended the relationship. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend was posting explicit content online. The author found out, felt cheated, even though she said it wasn't cheating because it's the internet. But he didn't want her to continue, and when she didn't, he broke up. \n\nNow, cheating typically involves physical or emotional infidelity. However, the girlfriend argues that posting on the internet isn't cheating. Some people might see sharing explicit content as a breach of trust, especially if it's done without the partner's knowledge. The author's reaction is based on his feelings of betrayal, even if it's not a traditional form of cheating.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. If the girlfriend was posting explicit content without discussing it with her partner, that could be an issue. The author felt it was a betrayal, and even though she didn't physically cheat, he might feel that her actions were a violation of their relationship's trust. \n\nOn the other hand, she didn't have a physical affair, so some might argue that the author overreacted. However, relationships are based on mutual respect and trust. If one partner feels that certain actions are a betrayal, even if the other doesn't, it can lead to a breakup. The author had the right to set boundaries and if those weren't respected, ending the relationship could be justified.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he followed through with his decision when his boundaries were crossed. The girlfriend didn't agree to stop, so he chose to end things. It's a matter of differing perspectives on what constitutes infidelity, but his reaction is valid based on his feelings.\n"
