Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who broke up with his girlfriend for her posting on gonewild is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy found out his girlfriend had posted explicit content of herself on a site called gonewild. He was upset, confronted her, and they had an argument. He then broke up because she wouldn't stop posting and even suggested doing couple posts. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are consent and boundaries. The girl was posting her own content, which isn't illegal, but it's personal. The guy felt it was akin to cheating, but she didn't see it that way. The main issue is whether sharing explicit content online is a dealbreaker and if his reaction was justified.\n\nI should consider both sides. The guy has the right to his feelings and boundaries. If he's uncomfortable with her posting, he's allowed to express that. But he also needs to respect her choices if they were consensual. However, in a relationship, certain boundaries are usually expected. If he didn't know about this beforehand and it's something he finds unacceptable, then breaking up might be his right.\n\nBut wait, is posting explicit content inherently cheating? That's debatable. Some people might see it as a personal choice, while others might feel it's a breach of trust. The girl said it's the internet, so it's not cheating. But the guy was upset, maybe because he felt she was exposing herself in a way he didn't agree with. \n\nAlso, the guy's reaction: he said some nasty things. That's not great. Confronting someone in a calm manner is better than being aggressive. He might have overreacted, but the situation is tense. He gave her an ultimatum, which is his choice, but maybe he could have tried to talk it out more.\n\nThe girl suggested couple posts, which might have made him even more uncomfortable. If she's pushing to involve him in her content, that could be a red flag for him. So his decision to end the relationship based on her unwillingness to stop might be his way of protecting his boundaries.\n\nIn terms of wrongdoing, the girl might have violated his trust without realizing it. But the guy breaking up because of this is his personal choice. Is he in the wrong for ending the relationship? Probably not, because he's allowed to set boundaries. However, if they had agreed on certain things beforehand and she broke them, that's different. But in this case, it seems like it came up unexpectedly. \n\nSo, the question is whether he's at fault. The user initially thought he is, but maybe not. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's acting on his discomfort and setting boundaries. However, if the girl was sharing her own content consensually, is it fair for him to break up over it? Some might say yes, others no. It's a personal choice. Without prior agreement, he can't expect her to stop, but he can decide to end the relationship if it's a dealbreaker. So he's not in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, the girl was the one who posted it. If it's her own content, maybe it's her right. But in a relationship, mutual respect and communication are key. If he hadn't discussed this with her before, he might have been unaware. So, maybe he's not in the wrong for breaking up if it's a dealbreaker for him. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He had the right to his feelings and boundaries, even if others might disagree.\n"
