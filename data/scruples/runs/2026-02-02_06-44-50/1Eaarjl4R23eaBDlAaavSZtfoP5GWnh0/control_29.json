Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her posting on gonewild is in the wrong. The scenario is a classic \"Am I the Asshole?\" situation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content online, specifically on a site like Gonewild. He confronted her, they argued, and he broke up because she didn't want to stop. He's now wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girlfriend's actions, the guy's reaction, and the context of their relationship. Let's break it down.\n\nThe girlfriend posted explicit content on a public platform. Even if it's just photos, sharing such content can be a big deal in a relationship. The guy felt it was a betrayal, especially since he saw her there and it felt like cheating. But wait, the girlfriend argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. That's an interesting point. But does that matter? Some people view sharing explicit material online, especially without consent or without the partner's knowledge, as a breach of trust.\n\nThe guy was upset, confronted her, and she didn't want to stop. He then decided to break up. Now, the question is whether he's wrong for doing that. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, relationships are about mutual respect and consent. If the girlfriend was okay with posting that content and the guy wasn't, then the issue is about differing values. But if the girl didn't inform him beforehand and he felt it was a deal-breaker, then his reaction might be justified. \n\nHowever, the way he reacted\u2014getting angry, saying nasty things, and breaking up immediately\u2014could be seen as extreme. But given that he felt betrayed, maybe it's understandable. Also, she suggested they do couple posts, which he might find even more problematic. \n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend didn't ask for his consent before posting. In many relationships, sharing explicit photos or videos, especially online, is a big deal. If she did this without discussing it with him, that's a breach of trust. So his reaction might be justified because he felt it was a violation of their relationship boundaries.\n\nOn the flip side, if she was okay with it and he wasn't, maybe he should have discussed it before taking such a drastic step. But since the argument happened and he felt the need to break up, it's about whether his reaction was appropriate given his feelings. \n\nAlso, the fact that she didn't want to stop indicates that she value her actions over his feelings. So the guy might feel that he can't be in a relationship where his boundaries are not respected. \n\nIn summary, the guy's reaction is based on his personal boundaries being violated. If the girlfriend didn't consider his feelings and continued to post, then his decision to break up might be seen as justified. Therefore, the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
