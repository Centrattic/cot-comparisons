Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she posted on gonewild. Let me go through the details again.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend and the author were in a relationship. The author found her posts on Reddit (gonewild is a subreddit known for NSFW content) without knowing it was her at first. He clicked through, realized it was her, and felt hurt. He confronted her, got into an argument where he said some harsh things, and she didn't want to stop posting. He ended the relationship, and now he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about trust, boundaries, and consent. The author was upset because his girlfriend was sharing explicit content online, which made him feel like she was cheating, even though she argued that internet activity isn't cheating. The definition of cheating can vary between partners, so communication about boundaries is crucial. \n\nHe confronted her, got angry, and she suggested they do couple posts together. He felt she didn't want to stop, so he ended the relationship. Now, the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nWell, everyone has the right to set boundaries in a relationship. If the girlfriend was comfortable with her online activity and the author wasn't, that's a conflict. However, the argument itself seems to have been heated. He said some nasty things, which might not be the best approach. But he did communicate his feelings and his limits. If she wasn't willing to respect those limits, then his decision to end the relationship is about self-respect and boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he could have handled it more calmly. But in the heat of the moment, it's hard to say. The fact that she suggested couple posts might have pushed him further. Breaking up because of a core value difference (trust and boundaries) isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong. He respected his own boundaries and made a decision based on his comfort level.\n"
