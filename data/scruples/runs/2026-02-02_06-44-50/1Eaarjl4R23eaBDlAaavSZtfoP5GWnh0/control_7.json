Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after finding her on gonewild. Hmm. First, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe guy found his girlfriend's post on a site called gonewild, which I think is a platform where people share explicit content. He clicked on it, realized it was her, and then confronted her. She said it wasn't cheating because it's the internet. He felt she wasn't respecting their relationship and ended it. Now he's wondering if he was in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether sharing explicit content online about oneself counts as cheating. The girlfriend's argument is that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. But the boyfriend felt differently. From a relationship ethics perspective, trust and mutual respect are key. If one partner does something that the other finds unacceptable, even if it's not a physical affair, it can still be a deal-breaker. \n\nCheating can be subjective. Some people consider emotional infidelity or sharing intimate content without consent as cheating. In this case, the girlfriend was posting explicit content, which the boyfriend found problematic. Even if she didn't see it as cheating, he did, which led to the breakup. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions of looking through her history might be a point of contention. He had a right to privacy too, but he was the one who discovered her posts. However, the main issue is the content she shared. She might have thought it was okay for her to post such content, but if it violated his trust, then the breakup could be justified from his perspective.\n\nAnother angle is communication. Did they discuss boundaries before this happened? If they didn't set clear expectations about sharing content online, both might be at fault. But since the girlfriend continued posting even after he confronted her and suggested she stop, it shows she didn't prioritize his feelings. That could make the boyfriend's decision to end things more reasonable.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend suggesting they do couple posts together after he was upset seems like she's not taking his feelings seriously. That's probably a red flag. So, the boyfriend might have been justified in breaking up because she wasn't respecting his boundaries.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, sharing explicit photos without the partner's knowledge can be seen as a breach of trust. Even if it's not illegal, it's a moral issue in the relationship. The boyfriend's reaction, while maybe harsh in the moment, stems from feeling betrayed.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He had the right to end the relationship if he felt her actions violated their trust. The girlfriend's behavior was the root cause here, not his decision to breakup.\n"
