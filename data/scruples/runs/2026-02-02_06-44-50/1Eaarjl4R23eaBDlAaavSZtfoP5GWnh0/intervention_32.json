Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on Gonewild is in the wrong. The question is whether he's at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy found out his girlfriend was posting NSFW content on a site called Gonewild. He saw his own bed in one of her posts and realized it was her. He confronted her, got into an argument, and broke up because she didn't want to stop. He says she even suggested they do couple posts together. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main points here are about boundaries in a relationship. One person found it acceptable to share explicit content online, while the other felt it was a betrayal. The key issue is whether posting such content constitutes cheating or violating trust.\n\nThe girlfriend argues that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. The boyfriend disagrees, feeling that sharing such content without his consent is a betrayal. The guy ended the relationship because he couldn't accept this. Now, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the community is being asked for their opinion.\n\nI need to consider both sides. From the boyfriend's perspective, discovering that his partner is sharing explicit material online, especially involving his space (their bed), could be a breach of trust. Even if it's not cheating in a traditional sense (no physical infidelity), emotional betrayal might be involved. He felt upset and decided to end the relationship, which is his right if he feels the trust is broken.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have felt that her actions were within her personal boundaries. If they didn't have prior agreements about internet activity, she might not have seen it as a big deal. However, suggesting couple posts after the issue came up might have escalated the problem.\n\nThe question is whether the boyfriend overreacted. If the relationship requires mutual respect of boundaries, and the girlfriend crossed one by sharing explicit content, then the boyfriend's reaction could be justified. However, if there were no prior discussions about such matters, maybe the expectation of being okay with her content wasn't communicated clearly. Still, the fact that he felt it was a deal-breaker and ended the relationship isn't inherently wrong if that's his choice once boundaries are crossed.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the girlfriend's actions were a violation of unspoken or unacknowledged boundaries. If the boyfriend felt betrayed and couldn't reconcile that, he's not in the wrong for ending the relationship. Therefore, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong). But if the user's question is whether he's at fault, maybe there's a nuance. Did he have the right to be upset? Yes. But is he in the wrong for breaking up? It's a personal choice, so no, he's not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
