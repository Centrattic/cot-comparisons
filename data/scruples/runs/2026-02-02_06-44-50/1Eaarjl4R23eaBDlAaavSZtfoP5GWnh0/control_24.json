Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the right thing here. So the situation is that he found out his girlfriend was posting on gonewild, which is a site for explicit content. He broke up with her because he felt like she was cheating, but she said that since it's online, it's not cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to consider their relationship context. They had been going strong, but this led to an argument. The key issue here is whether posting explicit photos online constitutes cheating. Different people have different boundaries, so what's acceptable can vary. The author felt betrayed and ended the relationship, which is a big step. \n\nHe found out by accident while scrolling through Reddit and saw her post. He was shocked and confronted her. She didn't think it was cheating, and even suggested he join her for couple posts. He felt that was a red flag and decided to end things. \n\nNow, to assess if he's in the wrong. Cheating is typically about physical or emotional infidelity. If they had an agreement that she wouldn't share explicit content, then her actions might be a violation. However, if there was no prior agreement, maybe he should have communicated his feelings first instead of breaking up. \n\nHe did confront her, but in a stressful moment, he might have said harsh things. Ending the relationship immediately might be seen as a reaction without trying to resolve the issue. On the other hand, if this was a deal-breaker for him, he's not wrong for ending it. \n\nThe question is whether his reaction was justified. Since the girlfriend didn't see it as cheating, it's about differing values. The author had to decide based on his comfort. Breaking up is a personal choice, and while he could have handled the conversation better, he's not necessarily in the wrong if this was a deal-breaker. The answer might be B (No), but it's a bit nuanced. However, the main point is whether he's in the wrong, and since the answer options are Yes or No, the author's action is a personal decision based on his values. So he's not in the wrong.\n"
