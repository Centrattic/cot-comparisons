Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their girlfriend for posting on Gonewild is in the wrong. The key points here are the context of the relationship, the specific action that caused the breakup, and the reasoning behind it.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend was posting on Gonewild, which is a platform associated with adult content. The author found her posts and felt it was a betrayal, leading him to break up. The girlfriend's argument was that since it's online, it's not cheating. The author, however, felt uncomfortable and decided to end the relationship when she didn't agree to stop posting.\n\nNow, considering relationship norms, sharing explicit content of oneself online can be a personal choice, but it might also be a dealbreaker for some partners. The author's reaction is based on his feelings of betrayal and discomfort. However, whether he's in the wrong depends on the mutual understanding in the relationship. If there were no prior discussions about boundaries regarding online content, then the author's reaction might be justified from his perspective. On the other hand, if the girlfriend didn't know it would bother him so much, maybe he should have communicated his feelings earlier instead of reacting impulsively.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. In relationships, both partners have the right to set boundaries. If the author couldn't accept her behavior and it was a dealbreaker, it's his choice to end the relationship. However, the way he handled it\u2014getting angry and deciding to break up immediately\u2014might be seen as harsh, but it's still his right. The girlfriend's suggestion that it's not cheating because it's online is a common argument, but fidelity in relationships isn't just about physical acts. Emotional and personal boundaries also matter.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's reaction is his prerogative. Since he's the one who felt this was unacceptable and chose to end the relationship, he isn't necessarily in the wrong. The wrong might be on the girlfriend for posting if he had previously expressed discomfort. But without prior communication, it's a personal choice to end the relationship. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
