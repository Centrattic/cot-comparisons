Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on gonewild is in the wrong. The situation is a bit tricky because it involves personal boundaries and expectations in a relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author found out his girlfriend was posting on a site like Gonewild, which is known for adult content. He felt it was a form of cheating, even though she argued that the internet isn't cheating. He ended the relationship because she didn't agree to stop, and she even suggested he join her for couple posts. The author is now wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, seeing his girlfriend's explicit content online, especially without his knowledge, could be a major breach of trust. Even if it's not traditional cheating, he might view it as a violation of their relationship's boundaries. His emotional reaction leads him to end the relationship, which he might see as necessary for his own peace of mind.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might believe that her actions are her personal choice and that sharing content online isn't the same as being unfaithful. She might feel that the author is overreacting or not respecting her autonomy. Also, the fact that she suggested he join in could indicate that she saw no issue with the behavior and wanted to include him, which complicates things.\n\nThe key here is about mutual respect and communication. The author didn't discuss this with her beforehand, which could be seen as a lack of communication. However, discovering such content without prior discussion might also be a shock. The girlfriend's refusal to stop might lead the author to feel that their values are incompatible.\n\nIn relationships, expectations vary. What one person finds acceptable, another might not. The author's decision to end the relationship is his choice, but whether he's in the wrong depends on the context of their discussions and agreed-upon boundaries. If they never talked about such things, the author might have a valid reason to feel betrayed. However, if he didn't express his feelings clearly before the incident, he could also be at fault for not communicating his boundaries.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author had previously discussed this issue with his girlfriend. If not, his reaction might be partly due to lack of communication. But given the circumstances, ending the relationship because of a fundamental disagreement on what constitutes cheating could be his way of protecting his own feelings. \n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because his decision stems from his personal boundaries and comfort in the relationship. However, it's a nuanced situation where both parties might have valid points. But according to the user's own thought that the author is in the wrong, maybe the answer is A. Wait, but the user is asking for an answer. Let me check again.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but is curious. The options are A for yes (author wrong) and B for no. Based on the analysis, if the author didn't communicate his boundaries beforehand, then maybe he's partially at fault. But if the girlfriend's actions crossed a line that he couldn't accept, then ending the relationship is his choice. The answer here is probably B (not in the wrong), as it's about personal boundaries and mutual agreement. So the correct answer is B.\n"
