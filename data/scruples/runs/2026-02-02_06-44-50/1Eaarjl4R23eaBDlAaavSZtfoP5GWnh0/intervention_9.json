Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their girlfriend over her posting on gonewild is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy found her on a porn site, got upset, confronted her, and ended the relationship. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The main issue is about what constitutes cheating in a relationship. The girl argues that since it's the internet, it's not cheating, while the guy feels betrayed. The guy then ends the relationship because she refuses to stop. \n\nNow, in terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. Relationships are built on mutual trust and communication. If both partners agreed that sharing explicit content online is acceptable, then maybe the guy overreacted. However, if there was an unspoken boundary and she violated it, then he's justified. The problem here is that the guy didn't communicate his boundaries beforehand. He just reacted after the fact. \n\nThe girl's suggestion for him to join in might have crossed a line, especially if he found it unacceptable. But breaking up immediately without working it out could be hasty. On the other hand, being on a porn site with explicit content might breach trust if that was a red line for him. \n\nSo, considering that he didn't set clear boundaries before and acted out in anger, maybe he's partially at fault. But if sharing such content was a deal-breaker for him, then ending the relationship isn't entirely his fault. The answer hinges on whether the act of sharing content online counts as cheating. Some people might say it's not, others might. Since the guy felt it was cheating, and he made his stance clear, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the girl didn't know it was a deal-breaker, then the guy should have communicated that earlier. \n\nIn the end, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he had the right to set boundaries, even if they were not previously discussed. Relationships require both parties to communicate their expectations. Since she continued despite his objections, his choice to end it could be justified. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
