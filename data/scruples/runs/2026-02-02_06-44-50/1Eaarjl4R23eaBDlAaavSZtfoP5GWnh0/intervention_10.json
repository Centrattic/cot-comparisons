Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she posted on Gone Wild. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend posted something explicit online, which the guy found out through Reddit. The argument is about whether that counts as cheating. The guy felt like she was being unfaithful, and the girl argued that since it's online, it's not cheating. The guy then ended the relationship, saying he can't accept that.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, posting explicit content online isn't the same as physical cheating, but it can still be a breach of trust depending on the relationship's boundaries. The guy might feel betrayed even if there's no physical infidelity. On the other hand, the girl might believe her actions were consensual and within her rights, maybe even not seeing it as cheating.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding of boundaries. If the guy never discussed his expectations with her before the incident, maybe he's at fault for not setting clear boundaries. However, if she was aware of his discomfort but continued, then she might be in the wrong. The guy did confront her, but his reaction led to a breakup. Was that justified? Ending the relationship because of something he didn't discuss beforehand could be seen as impulsive. However, if trust is broken, ending the relationship is a personal choice.\n\nThe girl suggested making couple posts, which might have been an attempt to include him, but the guy didn't want that. It's possible that both parties have valid perspectives. The guy acted based on his feelings of betrayal, while the girl didn't see her actions as cheating. Without prior discussion, it's unclear if there was a misunderstanding. So, is the guy in the wrong? He might have the right to end the relationship if he feels betrayed, but maybe he should have addressed the issue earlier. Alternatively, if he didn't set boundaries, he might be partially responsible for not communicating his needs. \n\nGiven that, I think the answer isn't straightforward. But according to the options, I have to choose A or B. The user says the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because he had the right to end the relationship if he felt trust was broken. However, some might argue that he should have handled it differently. But since the question is about being in the wrong, and he didn't act against agreed boundaries (if there were none set), maybe he's not in the wrong. The girl's actions might be the issue here. So B.\n"
