Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about breaking up with a girlfriend because she posted something on a site called gonewild. The author found her post on Reddit, realized it was her, and then broke up with her because he felt like she was cheating even though she said it wasn't. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what gonewild is. From what I know, gonewild is a site that hosts explicit content, often user-submitted. So if the girlfriend posted there, it's likely a nude or explicit photo of herself. The author found this and felt betrayed, leading to the breakup.\n\nThe key points here are the definition of cheating and the context of the posts. The author argues that seeing his girlfriend's explicit content online made him feel like she was cheating. The girlfriend, however, claims that posting online isn't cheating. \n\nI should consider societal views on this. Some people might see posting explicit photos online as a form of cheating, especially if it's done without the partner's knowledge or consent. Others might argue that as long as she's not physically cheating or sharing it with someone outside the relationship, it's her choice. But the author clearly felt violated and hurt, which is a valid emotional response.\n\nAnother angle is consent and communication. Did the girlfriend discuss with the author that she was posting such content? If not, then the lack of communication could be an issue. The author might have felt that this was a boundary crossed without his knowledge. \n\nHowever, the author reacted by confronting her in a heated manner, leading to an argument. He then gave her an ultimatum: stop posting or break up. She didn't agree, so he ended the relationship. Is that a fair response? Some might say that open communication and trying to resolve the issue together is better than an immediate breakup. But others might argue that if this issue is a deal-breaker for the author, he's within his rights to end the relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend's suggestion that he join her in posts might have been a way to normalize it for him, but that could also feel like a manipulation tactic. The author's decision to break up could stem from not being comfortable with the idea of such content being shared, even if it's his partner.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author's feelings are valid if he considers online posting as infidelity. However, if the girlfriend never agreed to that definition, then the author's reaction is based on his personal boundaries. Whether he's \"in the wrong\" depends on the mutual agreement in the relationship about what constitutes cheating. Since they didn't have that conversation beforehand, it's hard to say. The author might have been wrong not to discuss it first, but he's also within his rights to have boundaries. The girlfriend might be wrong for not respecting his boundaries once they were established. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer isn't clear-cut. The question asks if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (Yes), it's because he might have overreacted or didn't communicate his boundaries first. If B (No), it's because he has the right to his feelings and boundaries. Given the context, I think B is more likely the answer here because people have different boundaries in relationships, and the author's feelings are valid even if others disagree. But maybe there's room for both perspectives. However, the initial question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong (A), but I need to decide based on analysis. I might lean towards B, No, because he's acting according to his values, even if others don't agree.\n"
