Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who broke up with their girlfriend for posting on Gonewild is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe user found their girlfriend's posts on a site called Gonewild, which is an adult content platform. They argue about it, and the user breaks up because they feel she's cheating by posting such content. The girlfriend says it's not cheating since it's the internet. The user is now wondering if they did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I should consider what's considered cheating. Traditionally, cheating involves physical or emotional infidelity. However, some people might view sharing explicit content online as a form of betrayal, especially if it's done without the partner's knowledge or consent. The girlfriend argues it's not cheating because it's online, but the user disagrees.\n\nNext, the user confronted the girlfriend, and she suggested they could do couple posts together. This might indicate she's not in the wrong in her own eyes, but the user found this offensive or unacceptable. The user then ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop the posts.\n\nNow, whether the user is in the wrong. The key points here are consent and communication. If the girlfriend was posting content without discussing it with her partner, that could be an issue. However, if the user never explicitly told her that he found such posts unacceptable, maybe he's partly at fault for not setting boundaries earlier. On the other hand, the act of posting explicit material about oneself, especially in a relationship, might be a breach of trust. The user's reaction is emotional but understandable if he felt betrayed. Breaking up because of a fundamental difference in values (like sharing explicit content online) isn't necessarily wrong. However, the user's approach\u2014confronting her and ending the relationship abruptly\u2014might be seen as harsh, but given the circumstances, it's a personal choice. \n\nThe girlfriend's stance that internet activity isn't cheating might be a cultural or personal belief, but if the user finds it unacceptable, the relationship might not be compatible. So, the user made a decision based on his values and boundaries. Whether that's right or wrong is subjective, but in many cases, people have the right to end a relationship if there's a violation of their trust or values.\n"
