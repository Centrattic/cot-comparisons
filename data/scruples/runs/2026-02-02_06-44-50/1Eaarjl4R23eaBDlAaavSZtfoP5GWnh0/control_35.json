Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author found out their girlfriend was posting explicit content online, specifically on gonewild, which I think is a site for adult content. The author saw her post, realized it was her, confronted her, and then broke up because she didn't want to stop posting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend was posting on the internet, which is a public space. She might have thought that since it's online but not necessarily shared with others, it's okay. But the author felt it was cheating because they didn't discuss this before. The girlfriend argues that posting on the internet isn't cheating, which is a common debate in relationships. \n\nCheating usually refers to physical or emotional infidelity. However, some people consider sharing explicit content without the partner's consent as a form of betrayal, even if it's online. The author might feel violated because they were not aware of this and didn't agree to it. The girlfriend's suggestion to do couple posts might have made the author feel pressured into something they weren't comfortable with, which could be another point.\n\nThe key factors here are consent and communication. If the author and the girlfriend had different expectations about what constitutes cheating, then the problem is about differing values. The author decided to break up because they couldn't reconcile this difference. \n\nIs the author wrong for doing that? Well, if the girlfriend didn't want to stop and the author couldn't accept that, then the breakup is a personal choice based on their values. However, the author did confront her and gave her a chance to stop before breaking up. The girlfriend didn't want to change her behavior. In that case, the author is acting on their own boundaries. \n\nBut some might argue that posting explicit content without a partner's knowledge is a breach of trust, even if it's not traditional cheating. So the author's reaction is understandable. On the other hand, if they never discussed boundaries regarding online activity, the author could be seen as overreacting. \n\nI think the main issue is about mutual understanding. The author's decision to end the relationship because of a value difference isn't necessarily wrong. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
