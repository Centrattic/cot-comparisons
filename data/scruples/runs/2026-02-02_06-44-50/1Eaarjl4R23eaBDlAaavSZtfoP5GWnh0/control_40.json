Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on gonewild is in the wrong. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The guy found out his girlfriend was posting NSFW content online, specifically on gonewild, which is a forum for adult content. He felt she was cheating, even though she argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. He confronted her, got into an argument, and broke up. Now he's questioning if he was at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are about cheating and boundaries in a relationship. Cheating is typically defined as engaging in a physical or emotional relationship with someone outside of the committed relationship. However, the girlfriend argues that posting on the internet isn't cheating. The guy disagrees because he felt she was exposing herself in a way that he found unacceptable.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on several factors. First, did the girlfriend have a prior agreement with him about sharing personal content? If there was an understanding that she wouldn't post such content, then she might have broken that trust. However, if there was no such agreement, then maybe the guy's reaction is based on unspoken expectations.\n\nAnother angle is the definition of cheating. Some people consider sharing explicit content without their partner's knowledge as a form of betrayal, even if there's no physical or emotional infidelity involved. The guy's perspective is that he felt cheated because she was sharing herself online in a way that he wasn't comfortable with. On the other hand, the girlfriend might see it as her personal freedom unless there was a specific boundary set.\n\nThe argument here is that the guy had strong feelings about it, leading him to end the relationship. Breaking up is a personal choice, but the question is whether he was wrong to do so. If the action of posting explicit content without consent is considered a breach of trust, then the guy's reaction could be justified. However, if there was no prior discussion about such boundaries, then maybe the guy's expectations were unspoken, leading to conflict.\n\nIt's also important to note that the guy admitted to saying some harsh things during the argument. That could affect how the situation is viewed, as his communication might have contributed to the tension. However, the core issue is the posting of content and the differing views on what constitutes cheating.\n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to have open communication about boundaries. If the guy never discussed his feelings about such content before, he might have been setting himself up for misunderstanding. Conversely, if the girlfriend believed that online activity wasn't part of cheating, then his reaction might be seen as overstepping.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might hinge on whether there was an agreement or prior discussion. Since the scenario doesn't mention any prior conversation, the guy might have been wrong to have unspoken expectations. However, the act of posting explicit content without the partner's knowledge could still be seen as a betrayal in his eyes, making it a subjective issue.\n\nIn many cases, the act of sharing explicit material without consent can be considered a form of cheating by one partner, even if the other doesn't see it that way. So, the guy acting on his feelings and ending the relationship isn't necessarily in the wrong if he felt it was a deal-breaker. But if there was no prior discussion, some might argue he should have communicated his boundaries earlier.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he acted based on his feelings and boundaries, even though there might be differing opinions on what constitutes cheating. His decision to end the relationship is a personal choice based on his comfort level, and unless there was a prior agreement, he isn't necessarily at fault.\n"
