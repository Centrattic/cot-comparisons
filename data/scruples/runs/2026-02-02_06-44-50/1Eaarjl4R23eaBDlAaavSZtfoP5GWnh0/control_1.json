Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend because she posted on gonewild. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out that his girlfriend was posting explicit content online, specifically on gonewild, which is a site known for adult content. He felt she was cheating because she was posting these images. They had an argument, and he ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop, even suggesting they do couple posts. The question is whether he was wrong to break up with her.\n\nSo, the key points here are: consent, trust, and mutual expectations in the relationship. Did the girlfriend know that posting explicit photos online would be a deal-breaker for her partner? The author felt it was cheating, but the girlfriend didn't see it that way. The concept of cheating can vary between individuals. If the relationship had an understanding that sharing explicit content online was off-limits, then her actions might be considered a violation. However, if that wasn't discussed or agreed upon, then the girlfriend might not have realized it would be a problem.\n\nThe author acted based on his own feelings and values, which were hurt by her actions. Ending the relationship because of a deal-breaker is a valid reason. However, the way he handled the confrontation might be questioned\u2014getting \"aggy\" (angry) and saying nasty things could have made the situation worse. But the decision to break up because of incompatible boundaries is his right.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior might have been a breach of trust if she knew he wouldn't be okay with it. However, if she didn't think it was cheating and they never discussed it, then she wasn't necessarily in the wrong for doing something that wasn't agreed to be a boundary.\n\nSo, the author's actions stem from his personal boundaries being crossed. He has every right to end a relationship if a partner's actions violate those boundaries. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to consider if the act of posting on gonewild inherently violates trust without prior discussion. It's possible that the girlfriend didn't see it as a problem because they hadn't set those expectations. In that case, the author might be overreacting if there were no prior discussions about online behavior. But if he felt it was a deal-breaker, breaking up is his choice. It's a bit of a gray area, but the decision to end the relationship based on personal values isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
