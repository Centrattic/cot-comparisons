Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author breaking up with his girlfriend after finding her posts on Gonewild. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girlfriend was posting explicit content online, which the author discovered. The argument arises from whether this counts as cheating. The girlfriend argues that since it's online, it's not cheating, while the author feels betrayed. The author then breaks up with her after she refuses to stop posting.\n\nCheating definitions vary. Legally, cheating might not apply if it's consensual and done online. But emotionally, it's different. The author felt the act of posting explicit photos without his consent was a breach of trust. The girlfriend's suggestion to join her in posting might have made him uncomfortable, reinforcing his decision.\n\nThe author's reaction is driven by his feelings of betrayal and lack of consent. However, he did confront her and she didn't comply. Breaking up because of unmet boundaries might be justified from his perspective, but he did lash out emotionally. The question is whether his actions were reasonable.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. If the girlfriend didn't inform him about her posts, that's a problem. The author's right to set boundaries is valid. But his reaction\u2014calling it cheating and breaking up\u2014depends on mutual understanding. If they had discussed this before, it's a different scenario. Since they didn't, maybe the author overreacted. However, feeling that his partner's actions are a betrayal is subjective.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument that online isn't cheating is a common point. But for the author, it's a deal-breaker. The fact that she continued after being told not to might support the author's stance. Yet, some might say he should have addressed it earlier.\n\nOverall, it's a gray area. The author acted based on his feelings and boundaries. Since the girlfriend didn't respect his boundaries post-confrontation, the breakup might be justified. But whether he's in the wrong depends on cultural and personal beliefs about online actions. The answer hinges on whether consent and prior discussion were present, which they weren't. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
