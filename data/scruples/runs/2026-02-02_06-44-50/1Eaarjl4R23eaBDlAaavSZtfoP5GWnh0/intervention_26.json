Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with a girlfriend because she posted explicit content on GoWild, which he found out through Reddit. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author found his girlfriend's explicit post online and felt betrayed. He confronted her, they argued, and he broke up because she didn't want to stop posting. He's asking if he's at fault.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective: She might argue that sharing explicit content online isn't cheating, especially if they had no prior agreement about it. She might have thought it was her choice, and she didn't actually have an affair or anything. She even suggested doing couple posts, which could imply she wanted to include him.\n\nThe author's side: He felt like she was being unfaithful because of the explicit content. He was upset, couldn't sleep, and ended the relationship. He might believe that sharing such content without his consent breaches trust.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent, boundaries, and mutual understanding. If they were in a committed relationship and he didn't know about her posting explicit content, that's a breach of trust. But if they never discussed boundaries regarding internet activity, it's a gray area. \n\nThe author's reaction was to break up immediately. He didn't give her a chance to explain or talk it out. He was aggressive in his text and didn't consider her perspective. The girlfriend's response was defensive, and she didn't see it as cheating. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. If they never had a conversation about what's acceptable online, both could be at fault. The author could have approached the situation more calmly, discussed his feelings without accusing her immediately. However, finding out about such content can be a shock, and his reaction, while harsh, might be understandable given the circumstances.\n\nBut the fact that she didn't want to stop suggests she wasn't willing to respect his feelings once he expressed them. The author ended the relationship because he couldn't accept her actions, which is his right. The question is whether he was wrong to do so. \n\nIn many cases, people have different thresholds for what they consider cheating. If the author felt deeply betrayed, ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. However, the way he handled it\u2014being aggressive and not giving room for discussion\u2014might be seen as hasty. \n\nThe girlfriend's stance that internet activity isn't cheating unless there's a physical affair is a common viewpoint. If they were clear about their boundaries, but she violated them, then she's in the wrong. But if there were no explicit boundaries, it's unclear.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be in the wrong for ending the relationship because he couldn't accept her actions, but his approach could have been better. Alternatively, if they had discussed boundaries beforehand and she violated them, she'd be at fault. Since the situation isn't clear on previous agreements, it's a bit of a toss-up. However, the author's immediate breakup might be seen as a reaction to something he found unacceptable, which is his prerogative.\n"
