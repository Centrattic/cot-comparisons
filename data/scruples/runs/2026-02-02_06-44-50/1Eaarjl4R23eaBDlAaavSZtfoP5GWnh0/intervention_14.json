Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she posted on gonewild. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content on a site called gonewild. He was upset, thought she was cheating, and ended the relationship when she didn't stop. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom his perspective, he felt betrayed even though she argued that online activity isn't cheating. He had a strong reaction, said some harsh things, and ended the relationship. She suggested they do couple posts, which he found unacceptable. \n\nBut wait, is posting explicit photos of oneself considered cheating? That's subjective. Some people might see it as a violation of trust, especially if it's a shared account or if the content is intimate. Others might consider it a personal choice unless there's a mutual agreement against it. \n\nHe was upset, maybe overreacted. The key here is communication. If he didn't talk about it calmly and instead lashed out, that could be his fault. Also, breaking up immediately might not have given them a chance to resolve the issue. \n\nOn the other hand, if he had boundaries and she was aware but continued, he might have a right to end things. But was his reaction justified? He didn't give her a chance to explain or agree to stop. He also mentioned not exposing her, which shows he tried to be respectful, but the breakup was abrupt.\n\nSo, considering both sides: he had valid feelings of betrayal but handled it poorly. She might have violated his trust, but his response might have been too harsh. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If the main issue is his immediate breakup and harsh words without proper discussion, maybe he's at fault. But if her actions were a deal-breaker for him, then not.\n"
