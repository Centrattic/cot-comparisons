Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on GoneWild (a site known for NSFW content) is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the guy found out his girlfriend was on this site and posted explicit content. He confronted her, got into an argument, and ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop. He says he felt like she was cheating, even though she argued that online actions aren't cheating. \n\nHis reasoning for breaking up is that her behavior made him uncomfortable, and he felt violated. But wait, cheating typically involves infidelity, like having physical or emotional relations with someone else. If she's just posting her own content online, even if it's explicit, does that count as cheating? The girlfriend says the internet isn't cheating, which is a common debate. \n\nHe was angry and said some nasty things. Emotional reactions are normal in such situations, but the key here is their agreement. Did they have prior boundaries about sharing explicit content? If they did, then she might have broken them. But if there were no prior discussions, his reaction might be a bit harsh. \n\nHe also mentions she suggested they do couple posts together. That could be seen as an attempt to involve him, maybe to make it less about cheating and more about mutual participation. However, he still decided to end things. \n\nIs he in the wrong for breaking up? It's a personal choice. He had the right to set boundaries. If her actions violated those boundaries, then his decision is justified. But if he didn't discuss these boundaries beforehand, maybe he's overreacting. Also, his approach was emotional and maybe impulsive\u2014he waited till morning but still ended it quickly. \n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that online isn't cheating, which is a valid perspective for some people. However, trust and communication are crucial in relationships. If he felt betrayed, even without physical infidelity, that's his emotional reaction. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a judgment call. If they had an unspoken agreement about privacy and she broke it, then he's not. But if there were no set boundaries, he might be overstepping. Given the info, he acted based on his feelings of betrayal, so maybe he's not in the wrong. But the answer depends on whether their previous discussions about such matters existed. Since the scenario doesn't mention prior discussions, it's a bit ambiguous. However, given that he felt the need to end things due to his discomfort, and she wasn't willing to stop, it's a matter of personal values. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), he's not in the wrong because he had the right to set boundaries and act on his feelings of betrayal, even if it's a personal choice.\n"
