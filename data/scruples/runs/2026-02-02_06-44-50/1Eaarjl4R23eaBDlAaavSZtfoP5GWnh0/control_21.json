Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story did the wrong thing by breaking up with his girlfriend because she posted on Gonewild.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend posted a photo of herself on Gonewild, which is a website that hosts explicit content. The boyfriend found out and broke up with her because he felt like she was cheating, even though she argued that since it's online, it's not cheating. The main question is whether the boyfriend was in the wrong.\n\nI should consider the context. The girlfriend willingly posted explicit content online. The boyfriend discovered it and felt betrayed, leading to the breakup. The key points here are consent, communication, and expectations in the relationship. Did the girlfriend know that posting such content would be a deal-breaker for her partner? Did she discuss it with him beforehand? \n\nIn relationships, honesty and communication are crucial. If the girlfriend didn't discuss her intention to post explicit content, the boyfriend's reaction is understandable. However, some might argue that if the content is consensual and not shared with others, it's her choice. But in this case, the content was public on a site known for explicit material, which could be seen as a violation of trust.\n\nThe boyfriend waited until the morning to confront her, which shows he tried to process his emotions. However, during the confrontation, he became aggressive. The girlfriend suggested creating couple posts together, which might indicate she wasn't going to stop, leading to the breakup. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the boyfriend's actions are justified if he felt the trust was broken. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought it was her personal choice. The answer depends on societal norms and personal boundaries. Since the act of posting explicit content without the partner's knowledge can be seen as a breach of trust, the boyfriend's decision to end the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
