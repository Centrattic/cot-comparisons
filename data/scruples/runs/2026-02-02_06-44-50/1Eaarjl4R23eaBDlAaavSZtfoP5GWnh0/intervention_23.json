Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on gonewild is in the wrong. The question is between A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content online, specifically on gonewild, which is a site for adult content. He confronted her, they argued, and he broke up because she didn't want to stop. He's now asking if he's the asshole.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and consent. The user's main issue is that he feels his girlfriend was cheating by posting on the internet. But technically, sharing explicit photos of oneself (even if it's on a site like gonewild) isn't cheating unless there's an agreement otherwise. However, the context matters. If she posted these images without his knowledge and it made him uncomfortable, that's a problem. But was he in the wrong for breaking up?\n\nHe says he felt she was cheating because it was the internet. That's a common misconception. Cheating usually involves a betrayal with someone else. If she's just sharing her own content, unless there's an explicit agreement against it, it's not cheating. So his reasoning here is flawed. By breaking up because of this, he might be overreacting unless they had prior boundaries about such things.\n\nAlso, she suggested doing couple posts, which might imply she wanted him involved. If they didn't have that conversation beforehand, his reaction is more about his personal discomfort rather than an actual betrayal. The fact that he got angry and ended things might be hasty. He could have discussed boundaries first instead of assuming cheating.\n\nBut then again, if the content included him without his consent, that's a different story. However, the description says she was the one in the post, so maybe it's just her content. If they had an agreement about not sharing explicit material, then he's right to be upset. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If there was no prior agreement, then his reaction is based on his own discomfort, which he could have addressed differently.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. He should have talked about his feelings about her posting such content before making a decision. By breaking up immediately, he might not have given her a chance to explain or adjust. However, if this was a deal-breaker for him, he's not entirely wrong. But his justification of \"cheating\" because of the internet is questionable. So the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because his reasoning was incorrect and he didn't handle it properly. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if he had a right to his boundaries.\n"
