Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for breaking up with his girlfriend after discovering she posted explicit content on Gonewild. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend posted explicit photos, which the author found out by accident. The key points here are consent, boundaries, and mutual understanding in the relationship.\n\nThe author felt betrayed, thinking she might be cheating, but she argued that online actions don't count as cheating. This shows a fundamental disagreement on what constitutes betrayal. The girlfriend's willingness to continue posting despite the author's objections might indicate she didn't consider it a deal-breaker, but for the author, it was a major issue leading to the breakup.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, honesty and communication are crucial. The author confronted her, which is reasonable, but the argument escalated. The girlfriend's suggestion for the author to join in might have crossed a line for him. The decision to end the relationship because she wouldn't stop posting could be seen as his way of setting boundaries. \n\nHowever, some might argue that he overreacted, especially since she didn't explicitly cheat. But the emotional impact and the fact that boundaries were violated (her posting without his knowledge) are valid reasons for him to feel hurt. \n\nIn relationships, what one person finds unacceptable might be different for another. Since the author made his decision based on his comfort and values, it's hard to say he's entirely in the wrong. The answer likely leans towards B, No.\n"
