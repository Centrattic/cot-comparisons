Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content on GoneWild, a site known for adult content. He broke up with her over this, and he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend was posting on GoneWild, which the author found out about by accident. He confronted her, they argued, and he ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop. The question is whether he did the right thing.\n\nOn one hand, some people might argue that she wasn't cheating in the traditional sense because it's online. She might have chosen to share her explicit photos online, which is a personal decision. However, if the relationship had boundaries about such things, then this could be a breach of trust. The author might have felt that this was a deal-breaker for him, which is his right. But does that make him the asshole?\n\nOn the other hand, the author admitted he said some nasty things during the confrontation. That's not great. Also, the girlfriend suggested they do couple posts together, which could have been an attempt to involve him or resolve the issue. Ending the relationship immediately without further discussion might be seen as hasty, but if he felt it was too much for him, maybe it's his prerogative.\n\nAnother angle is consent and communication. If the girlfriend chose to post those photos, it's her choice unless there was a prior agreement against it. The author didn't mention discussing boundaries beforehand. If there was no prior agreement, he can't really hold it against her unless it's a violation of their established norms. But if he found out after the fact and it made him uncomfortable, that's valid. However, breaking up might be an extreme reaction, but it's his choice based on his feelings.\n\nAlso, the fact that she didn't want to stop might indicate that it's important to her, and he felt it was important to end the relationship. Whether that's the right decision is subjective. The author might not be in the wrong if he had the right to set boundaries in the relationship. However, if the breakup was abrupt and he didn't consider her perspective, maybe he could have handled it differently.\n\nI think it's a tough call. The author's reaction is based on his personal values and what he can accept in a relationship. If he felt that her actions were a violation of their trust or his comfort levels, then ending it isn't necessarily wrong. But if she didn't realize it was an issue, maybe he should have communicated earlier. The key here is that both parties have different values, and the author is acting on his own discomfort. Unless there was a clear agreement she broke, it's hard to say he's in the wrong. However, his approach during the argument might have been harsh, but the decision to end it could be his right.\n"
