Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author breaking up with his girlfriend because she posted on GoneWild, which he found out through seeing her on a porn post on Reddit.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author was scrolling through Reddit, saw a Gonewild post (which is a porn site), and realized it was his girlfriend. He confronted her, she said it wasn't cheating because it's the internet, and he ended the relationship. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide.\n\nSo, the key points here are: \n\n1. Did the girlfriend cheat? She posted nude content online. But cheating usually involves physical or emotional infidelity with someone else. If she's just posting her own content without sharing it with a third party, it's not exactly cheating. However, some people might find this a violation of trust, especially if they had an agreement not to do so.\n\n2. The author's reaction: He confronted her, got angry, and ended the relationship. Is that justified? It depends on their relationship boundaries. If they never discussed or agreed on boundaries regarding online content, then she might not have known it was a deal-breaker. But if he felt uncomfortable and she continued, then maybe he's right to leave.\n\n3. The girlfriend suggested making couple posts together. This could imply that she didn't see it as a problem and wanted to involve him. If he wasn't okay with that, maybe their relationship had different expectations.\n\n4. The author's immediate breakup after confrontation might be seen as hasty. Did he give her a chance to explain or change her behavior? She mentioned she was reeling from a night out, maybe she made the post impulsively.\n\n5. Privacy and consent: If she posted without his knowledge, even if it's her own content, it's a breach of privacy if he wasn't aware. But if she was upfront about it, maybe he should have known. The story says he found it accidentally, so she didn't tell him beforehand.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's situational. If the girlfriend's actions were a violation of agreed-upon boundaries, then the author isn't in the wrong. If there were no such boundaries, then he might be overreacting. However, the author's main issue is feeling like she was betraying trust, even if she didn't have a physical affair. Emotionally, he felt that posting explicit content online was equivalent to cheating in their relationship.\n\nBut in the eyes of many, unless they had a specific agreement, posting one's own content isn't cheating. So the author might be in the wrong for assuming it was cheating and ending the relationship over it without discussing it more. However, it's also about personal values and how the relationship's boundaries were set. Since the author didn't mention prior discussions about this, he might have acted based on his own judgment without considering hers. But the girlfriend's suggestion to make couple posts together might have pushed him to his limit, so he felt it was a deal-breaker.\n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he ended the relationship over an action that isn't traditionally considered cheating unless agreed otherwise. However, if their relationship had specific boundaries about online content, then it's different. Since there's no mention of prior discussions, it's more his own projection of what's acceptable in the relationship.\n"
