Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she posted on gonewild. From the story, the guy found her post on Reddit, which he later realized was her. He confronted her, got into an argument, and ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend was posting explicit content online. The author saw that on a forum, which he didn't realize was her at first. He felt betrayed, even though she argues that internet activity isn't cheating. The author ended the relationship because he couldn't handle it, and she didn't agree to stop.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on perspectives. From his side, finding intimate content of his girlfriend online must feel like a violation of trust, even if it's public. He might see it as a form of cheating or a breach of their relationship boundaries. His emotional reaction is valid because he felt hurt and betrayed.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might believe that sharing such content online, especially if it's consensual and not shared behind his back in a deceptive way, isn't cheating. She might view it as her personal choice, as long as it's not in a relationship where such behavior was previously agreed upon. However, the fact that she suggested he join her for couple posts could indicate she didn't realize how it might affect him or that she wasn't respecting his feelings.\n\nThe author's decision to break up is a personal choice based on his values and what he can accept in a relationship. If their communication was lacking, maybe they should have discussed boundaries earlier. But the author acted out of his feelings of betrayal, which is natural. Breaking up to protect himself from further hurt isn't necessarily wrong. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, maybe there's a nuance where he could have addressed the issue more calmly. The question is whether his actions were justified given the situation. Alternatively, if the girlfriend's actions were a deal-breaker for him, then ending the relationship is his right. So, the answer is B.\n"
