Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on GoneWild is in the wrong. The situation is a bit tricky.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The guy found out his girlfriend had posted explicit content online, specifically on a site like GoneWild. He confronted her, there was an argument, and he ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop. He's asking if he's the asshole here (AITA). The user initially thought he's in the wrong but wants my input.\n\nSo, the main points are: He found her explicit posts, felt it was equivalent to cheating, she said it's the internet so it's not cheating, he ended the relationship. Now, is he in the wrong?\n\nWell, from a relationship standpoint, trust and boundaries are crucial. If he felt that her posting explicit content online was a violation of their trust, then it's his right to end the relationship. However, the way he approached it might matter. He mentioned getting angry and saying nasty things. That could have been harsh, but the core issue is about differing values. She wanted to continue, he didn't. \n\nLegally, in many places, posting explicit content isn't cheating, but in a relationship, people have different boundaries. If the girlfriend agreed to it and he didn't, then her actions crossed his personal boundary. So, he has a valid reason to break up. However, some might argue that his reaction was too extreme, especially if the content wasn't shared with others or was consensual. \n\nThe key here is that relationships require mutual agreement on boundaries. If she wasn't violating any rules (like having an online account he didn't know about), but he found out and it made him uncomfortable, then it's his right to end it. He might not be in the wrong for breaking up, but maybe the way he handled it could have been better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for the breakup itself. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often consider intent and mutual understanding. If the girlfriend didn't realize it would hurt him, but he still felt it was a deal-breaker, then it's not entirely his fault. So, the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong). But I need to make sure I'm not missing any nuances. Also, the fact that she invited him to join in might have added to his discomfort, reinforcing his decision. So, overall, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his comfort and boundaries.\n"
