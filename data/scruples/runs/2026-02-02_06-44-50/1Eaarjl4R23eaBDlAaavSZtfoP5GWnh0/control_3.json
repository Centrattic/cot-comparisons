Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she posted on Gonewild. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The key points are that the author found his girlfriend's explicit photos on an adult website. He argues that seeing her in such a context made him feel like she was cheating, even though she insists that since it's on the internet, it's not cheating. The author then broke up with her after a confrontation where she suggested even doing couple posts. \n\nI should consider different perspectives. From the author's side, discovering explicit images of his partner in a public forum might be a major breach of trust. He felt betrayed and decided to end the relationship, which is a personal choice. On the other hand, the girlfriend might think that sharing such photos is her personal choice, and the author overreacting. \n\nLegal and social norms vary. In some cultures, sharing explicit images without consent is a serious issue, even if it's one's own photos. Privacy is a big concern here. The girlfriend's decision to post such content might not be illegal, but it could be seen as a violation of trust in a relationship. \n\nCommunication is key in relationships. The author confronted her, which is a valid step. However, his reaction was to end the relationship immediately. The girlfriend's suggestion to do couple posts might have been a red flag he couldn't accept. \n\nIt's important to note that there's no one-size-fits-all answer here. The author's decision is based on his personal boundaries. If he felt that this behavior was unacceptable, then ending the relationship is a choice he made. However, some might argue that he didn't give her a chance to explain or that he was quick to judge. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's perspective matters. If she didn't realize the impact of her actions, the author might need to explain why this was hurtful. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's reaction is a matter of personal values. Since he made a decision based on his own boundaries and communicated it, he isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
