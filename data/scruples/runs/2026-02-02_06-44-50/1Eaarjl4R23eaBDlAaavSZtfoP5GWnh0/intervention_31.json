Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend because she posted explicit content on a site called gonewild. The key points to consider are: their communication, mutual expectations in the relationship, and the context of the situation.\n\nFirst, the author found out his girlfriend was posting on gonewild. He was shocked and felt she was cheating because she was posting explicit content. But she argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. That's a big point. Cheating typically involves infidelity, but in modern relationships, boundaries around social media and online activity can vary. Some people might consider sharing explicit content without the partner's consent as a breach of trust, even if it's not physical cheating.\n\nThe author confronted her and got angry, saying some nasty things. He then gave her an ultimatum: stop posting or he would end the relationship. She suggested he join her for couple posts, which he didn't take, leading to the breakup. \n\nNow, whether he's in the wrong depends on several factors. Did they have an agreement about sharing explicit content? If the girlfriend didn't inform him about her posts beforehand, maybe she should have communicated that. However, if the author didn't set clear boundaries about what's acceptable, he might also be at fault. \n\nCheating definitions can be subjective. If they never discussed what constitutes cheating, both might have different views. The author might have felt betrayed, but if the girlfriend wasn't aware it would be an issue, she might not have intended to hurt him. \n\nBreaking up is a big decision. The author acted out of emotion, maybe without fully discussing and trying to resolve the issue. He could have given her a chance to explain or agreed on a compromise. However, if he felt that her actions violated his trust and he couldn't move past it, ending the relationship could be justified. \n\nIn relationships, transparency and communication are key. If the girlfriend was posting content without considering her partner's feelings, that's on her. But if the author didn't express his boundaries earlier, he shares some responsibility. The fact that she suggested he join in might indicate she wasn't willing to stop, which could validate the author's decision to end things.\n\nOverall, it's a bit of a gray area. If the author had clear boundaries that weren't communicated to her, then maybe he's in the wrong for not talking about it sooner. But if he felt genuinely betrayed and couldn't reconcile that, he's not wrong for ending the relationship. The answer might depend on whether the girlfriend knew his expectations and the nature of their relationship's boundaries.\n"
