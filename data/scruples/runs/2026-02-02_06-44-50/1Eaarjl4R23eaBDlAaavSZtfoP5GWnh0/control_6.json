Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after finding her on a porn site, Gonewild.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy found his girlfriend's post on a site he considers, presumably, as a platform for explicit content. He was shocked, confronted her, they argued, and he broke up with her because she didn't want to stop posting. The key points here are consent, trust, and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nThe girl argues that posting on the internet isn't cheating. But for the guy, seeing her in such content was a deal-breaker. Relationships require mutual respect and understanding of each other's boundaries. If she was posting explicit content, even if it's not a physical affair, it might go against his comfort levels. The fact that she suggested he join her for couple posts adds another layer, implying she might be looking to involve him in her activities, which he clearly didn't want.\n\nCheating definitions can vary. Some people consider emotional infidelity or sharing explicit content online as cheating. The guy felt betrayed, which is a valid emotional response. However, was he wrong to break up? Well, if the relationship had prior discussions about boundaries, maybe. But since this is the first incident leading to a breakup, it's hard to say he's in the wrong. He had a right to his feelings. On the other hand, maybe he should have discussed it more calmly before breaking up, but given the emotional state, it's understandable.\n\nThe girl's stance that internet activity isn't cheating might not align with his values. So the conflict here is about differing views on what constitutes betrayal. Since the guy acted based on his boundaries, which she wasn't respecting, I think he's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
