Spinel stenosis, osteoarthritis, and my cartilage are essentially being attacked by my body and being broken down and along with this being legally blind. So with all of that, I really can't bend down, walk very far, or walk without limping for the most part. I have good days and bad days like most people my bad days however just involve me being stuck in bed until my body decides to stop hating me. \n\nNow onto today's events, I was grocery shopping, minding my own damn business just trying to get some chicken noodle soup before a damn blizzard hit and I see a package of I think taco seasoning? Idk what it was, but I asked the person in front of me if they dropped it, they said no, and I went along. Now if I could have bend down and picked it up I would have, however, if I tried to do that today there's a 90% chance I would have been stuck bend over or at least in severe pain, and falling is a real possibility for me as I'm not good with balance.\n\nAnother woman in the isle pushes past me and says \"Fine just leave it then.\", I figured she just didn't know I had joint pains or didn't notice me limping around and turned to say \"Sorry, I have joint problems and can't really bend over.\" and she scoffs and says \"don't make up fake excuses\" and then calls me a 'lazy millennial' and said something else under her breath I couldn't quite catch, and typically I'm pretty rational but I'm already in pain and this lady struck a nerve so I said \"Don't be such a cunt\" and walked off to continue my shopping. \n\nWhen telling a friend of mine this, they said I was being an asshole to her. Personally, I don't think I was, she's the one pushing people aside and starting shit, so I figure I'd let the internet decide. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called a woman a cunt is in the wrong. The situation involves the person having health issues that make it difficult to bend down. They were in a grocery store, saw something on the floor, asked the person in front if they dropped it, and when the other woman pushed past and dismissed them, the author responded with an insult.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has legitimate health problems that prevent them from bending down. They tried to explain their situation but were met with hostility. The other woman accused them of making up excuses and called them a \"lazy millennial.\" The author, already in pain, responded with \"Don't be such a cunt.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. The key points here are the provocation from the other woman and the author's response. The other person was dismissive and insulting, which might have escalated the situation. However, using a strong swear word like \"cunt\" is a clear insult. Even if provoked, using such language could be seen as inappropriate. The author's friend also said they were being an asshole, which is a perspective to consider.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was in pain and dealing with chronic health issues, which might have affected their tolerance. But regardless of the circumstances, name-calling is generally not acceptable. The response, while understandable given the provocation, doesn't excuse the use of a derogatory term. The other woman's actions were rude, but the author's response wasn't a proportionate reaction. So, the author did have a reason to be upset, but the choice of words was definitely in the wrong.\n"
