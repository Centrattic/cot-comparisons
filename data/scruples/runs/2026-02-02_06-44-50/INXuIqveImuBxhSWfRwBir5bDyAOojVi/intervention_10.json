Spinel stenosis, osteoarthritis, and my cartilage are essentially being attacked by my body and being broken down and along with this being legally blind. So with all of that, I really can't bend down, walk very far, or walk without limping for the most part. I have good days and bad days like most people my bad days however just involve me being stuck in bed until my body decides to stop hating me. \n\nNow onto today's events, I was grocery shopping, minding my own damn business just trying to get some chicken noodle soup before a damn blizzard hit and I see a package of I think taco seasoning? Idk what it was, but I asked the person in front of me if they dropped it, they said no, and I went along. Now if I could have bend down and picked it up I would have, however, if I tried to do that today there's a 90% chance I would have been stuck bend over or at least in severe pain, and falling is a real possibility for me as I'm not good with balance.\n\nAnother woman in the isle pushes past me and says \"Fine just leave it then.\", I figured she just didn't know I had joint pains or didn't notice me limping around and turned to say \"Sorry, I have joint problems and can't really bend over.\" and she scoffs and says \"don't make up fake excuses\" and then calls me a 'lazy millennial' and said something else under her breath I couldn't quite catch, and typically I'm pretty rational but I'm already in pain and this lady struck a nerve so I said \"Don't be such a cunt\" and walked off to continue my shopping. \n\nWhen telling a friend of mine this, they said I was being an asshole to her. Personally, I don't think I was, she's the one pushing people aside and starting shit, so I figure I'd let the internet decide. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for calling a woman a cunt at the grocery store. The background is that the person has several health issues making it hard to bend down and pick up a dropped item. The other woman pushed past them and accused them of making fake excuses and being a lazy millennial. The author then responds with \"Don't be such a cunt.\"\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation based on the information given. The author couldn't pick up the item due to their health conditions. The other woman didn't help and instead mocked them. The author was already in pain, which might have affected their reaction. \n\nNow, the key here is whether using a derogatory term like \"cunt\" was an appropriate response. Even if the other person was being rude, the author's use of a swear word and a derogatory comment could be seen as escalating the conflict. The author might have felt provoked, but the response was still aggressive. \n\nAlso, the author mentioned that they are legally blind and have mobility issues. That's a valid reason for not being able to bend down, so the other woman's accusation of faking an excuse is baseless. However, the author's reaction of calling her a cunt is a swear word that's offensive, especially towards a woman. It's a harsh term that's not necessary even in the heat of the moment. \n\nThe friend said the author was the asshole, and the person is seeking validation. The author's intention was to defend themselves against an unfair accusation, but the method was inappropriate. In most social contexts, using such language is considered rude and unprofessional, even if the other person was being difficult. \n\nSo, while the other woman was clearly in the wrong for her unkind and dismissive behavior, the author's response might have crossed a line. The question is whether the author is just as wrong for using that term. The answer likely depends on the perspective, but the author's choice of words was definitely an asshole move regardless of the provocation.\n"
