Spinel stenosis, osteoarthritis, and my cartilage are essentially being attacked by my body and being broken down and along with this being legally blind. So with all of that, I really can't bend down, walk very far, or walk without limping for the most part. I have good days and bad days like most people my bad days however just involve me being stuck in bed until my body decides to stop hating me. \n\nNow onto today's events, I was grocery shopping, minding my own damn business just trying to get some chicken noodle soup before a damn blizzard hit and I see a package of I think taco seasoning? Idk what it was, but I asked the person in front of me if they dropped it, they said no, and I went along. Now if I could have bend down and picked it up I would have, however, if I tried to do that today there's a 90% chance I would have been stuck bend over or at least in severe pain, and falling is a real possibility for me as I'm not good with balance.\n\nAnother woman in the isle pushes past me and says \"Fine just leave it then.\", I figured she just didn't know I had joint pains or didn't notice me limping around and turned to say \"Sorry, I have joint problems and can't really bend over.\" and she scoffs and says \"don't make up fake excuses\" and then calls me a 'lazy millennial' and said something else under her breath I couldn't quite catch, and typically I'm pretty rational but I'm already in pain and this lady struck a nerve so I said \"Don't be such a cunt\" and walked off to continue my shopping. \n\nWhen telling a friend of mine this, they said I was being an asshole to her. Personally, I don't think I was, she's the one pushing people aside and starting shit, so I figure I'd let the internet decide. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called a woman a \"cunt\" in a grocery store situation is in the wrong. The key points here are understanding both sides' actions and the context.\n\nThe author has significant health issues that limit their ability to bend or walk. They were shopping and saw a dropped item. They asked the person in front if they dropped it, got a no, and couldn't pick it up themselves because of their condition. Then another woman pushed past them and told them to leave it. The author tried to explain their inability, but the woman accused them of making excuses and called them a \"lazy millennial.\" The author then responded with \"Don't be such a cunt.\"\n\nFirst, the author's intent: They were trying to be polite but were met with hostility. They had a valid reason for not picking up the item. However, their response was a swear word. Now, whether that makes them in the wrong depends on societal norms. Using a curse word is generally considered rude, even if provoked. The woman was indeed rude first, but the author's response escalated the situation. \n\nThe author might argue that they were in pain and had a valid reason, but using a derogatory term is still a poor choice. The other person's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's reaction crosses a line into being disrespectful. The friend's opinion that the author was the asshole is based on the idea that even if provoked, the response was unkind. So, while the other woman started it, the author's use of a vulgar term is the issue here. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
