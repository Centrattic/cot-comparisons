Spinel stenosis, osteoarthritis, and my cartilage are essentially being attacked by my body and being broken down and along with this being legally blind. So with all of that, I really can't bend down, walk very far, or walk without limping for the most part. I have good days and bad days like most people my bad days however just involve me being stuck in bed until my body decides to stop hating me. \n\nNow onto today's events, I was grocery shopping, minding my own damn business just trying to get some chicken noodle soup before a damn blizzard hit and I see a package of I think taco seasoning? Idk what it was, but I asked the person in front of me if they dropped it, they said no, and I went along. Now if I could have bend down and picked it up I would have, however, if I tried to do that today there's a 90% chance I would have been stuck bend over or at least in severe pain, and falling is a real possibility for me as I'm not good with balance.\n\nAnother woman in the isle pushes past me and says \"Fine just leave it then.\", I figured she just didn't know I had joint pains or didn't notice me limping around and turned to say \"Sorry, I have joint problems and can't really bend over.\" and she scoffs and says \"don't make up fake excuses\" and then calls me a 'lazy millennial' and said something else under her breath I couldn't quite catch, and typically I'm pretty rational but I'm already in pain and this lady struck a nerve so I said \"Don't be such a cunt\" and walked off to continue my shopping. \n\nWhen telling a friend of mine this, they said I was being an asshole to her. Personally, I don't think I was, she's the one pushing people aside and starting shit, so I figure I'd let the internet decide. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is at the grocery store, has some health issues that make it hard for them to bend down. They see a package on the floor, ask the person in front if they dropped it, and the person says no. The author can't bend down to pick it up because of their condition. Then another woman pushes past and tells them to leave it. The author explains their difficulty, the woman scoffs, calls them a lazy millennial, and the author responds with \"Don't be such a cunt.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid reason for not being able to bend down. They mentioned specific medical conditions, which are legitimate. So when they tried to explain their situation, the other woman didn't believe them and made a harsh comment. That's rude and dismissive. But then the author called her a \"cunt,\" which is a strong swear word. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. The key points are: the author was in pain, had a legitimate reason, the other woman was rude and possibly judgmental. The author's response was a direct insult. Even if provoked, using such a strong expletive is generally considered inappropriate in public and could be seen as the author's fault for escalating the situation. \n\nHowever, the other woman started the conflict by pushing past and being dismissive. The author was already in a vulnerable state due to their health. People might argue that the author had a right to react, but using a swear word like \"cunt\" is pretty harsh. Depending on the context, maybe the author could have de-escalated the situation by walking away instead of responding with a curse. \n\nOn the other hand, if the other woman was being intentionally mean and the author was just trying to defend themselves, some might see the author's response as a justified reaction to being insulted. But in general, using such a strong expletive is likely to be seen as the wrong move, regardless of provocation. So I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong, because even though the other woman was rude, the author could have handled it without the insult. The key is that the author's response was a direct attack, which is usually considered inappropriate, even if provoked.\n"
