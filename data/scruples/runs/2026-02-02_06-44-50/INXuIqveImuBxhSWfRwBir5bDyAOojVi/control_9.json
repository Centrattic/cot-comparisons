Spinel stenosis, osteoarthritis, and my cartilage are essentially being attacked by my body and being broken down and along with this being legally blind. So with all of that, I really can't bend down, walk very far, or walk without limping for the most part. I have good days and bad days like most people my bad days however just involve me being stuck in bed until my body decides to stop hating me. \n\nNow onto today's events, I was grocery shopping, minding my own damn business just trying to get some chicken noodle soup before a damn blizzard hit and I see a package of I think taco seasoning? Idk what it was, but I asked the person in front of me if they dropped it, they said no, and I went along. Now if I could have bend down and picked it up I would have, however, if I tried to do that today there's a 90% chance I would have been stuck bend over or at least in severe pain, and falling is a real possibility for me as I'm not good with balance.\n\nAnother woman in the isle pushes past me and says \"Fine just leave it then.\", I figured she just didn't know I had joint pains or didn't notice me limping around and turned to say \"Sorry, I have joint problems and can't really bend over.\" and she scoffs and says \"don't make up fake excuses\" and then calls me a 'lazy millennial' and said something else under her breath I couldn't quite catch, and typically I'm pretty rational but I'm already in pain and this lady struck a nerve so I said \"Don't be such a cunt\" and walked off to continue my shopping. \n\nWhen telling a friend of mine this, they said I was being an asshole to her. Personally, I don't think I was, she's the one pushing people aside and starting shit, so I figure I'd let the internet decide. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for calling a woman a \"cunt\" at the grocery store. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the background: The person has significant health issues\u2014spinal stenosis, osteoarthritis, cartilage issues, and is legally blind. These conditions make it hard for them to bend down, walk, or avoid limping. On bad days, they can't even get out of bed. So they're dealing with chronic pain and physical limitations. That's pretty serious and probably affects their daily activities a lot.\n\nNow, the incident: They were shopping and saw a dropped item. They asked the person in front if they dropped it, which the person denied. The user couldn't bend down themselves due to their health, so they let it be. Then another woman told them to just leave it. The user explained their situation, but she scoffed, accused them of making up excuses, called them a \"lazy millennial,\" and said something else under her breath. The user, already in pain, responded with \"Don't be such a cunt\" and walked off.\n\nThe user's friend said they were the asshole, but they think the woman started it by pushing past and making snide comments. So the question is: Is the user in the wrong?\n\nI need to consider both sides. The user has valid health reasons for not being able to bend down. They tried to explain their situation, which the other woman dismissed rudely. Her comments about laziness and fake excuses are clearly condescending and unkind. However, the user's response was to call her a \"cunt,\" which is a very strong and offensive term. \n\nEven though the other woman was rude first, the user's reply was also aggressive and derogatory. The user's health issues are real, but the response might still be considered inappropriate. In public settings, people often have different thresholds for what's acceptable when dealing with conflict. While the woman's behavior was inconsiderate, using a swear word might escalate the situation and could be seen as unprofessional or disrespectful, regardless of the provocation.\n\nIt's important to note that the user was likely in pain and frustrated, which can lower one's tolerance for rudeness. However, the act of cursing at someone, even if they were mean first, is a choice. The user could have responded without using a foul word. Also, the context of the situation\u2014being in a public place and dealing with a stranger\u2014might make the user's response more notable.\n\nOn the other hand, the other woman's behavior was clearly at fault. She didn't help pick up the item, dismissed the user's genuine explanation, and made a derogatory comment. The user might have felt disrespected and wanted to assert themselves, but the choice of language is where the issue lies.\n\nIn AITA judgments, both parties often have some responsibility. The user was provoked, but their response was also unkind. The woman was inconsiderate, but the user's reaction crossed a line. So, the answer isn't entirely clear-cut. However, the key question is whether the user is in the wrong. Since they used an offensive term, even if justified by the provocation, they might be considered in the wrong for that specific action. But maybe the judgment is that both are at fault to some extent.\n"
