Spinel stenosis, osteoarthritis, and my cartilage are essentially being attacked by my body and being broken down and along with this being legally blind. So with all of that, I really can't bend down, walk very far, or walk without limping for the most part. I have good days and bad days like most people my bad days however just involve me being stuck in bed until my body decides to stop hating me. \n\nNow onto today's events, I was grocery shopping, minding my own damn business just trying to get some chicken noodle soup before a damn blizzard hit and I see a package of I think taco seasoning? Idk what it was, but I asked the person in front of me if they dropped it, they said no, and I went along. Now if I could have bend down and picked it up I would have, however, if I tried to do that today there's a 90% chance I would have been stuck bend over or at least in severe pain, and falling is a real possibility for me as I'm not good with balance.\n\nAnother woman in the isle pushes past me and says \"Fine just leave it then.\", I figured she just didn't know I had joint pains or didn't notice me limping around and turned to say \"Sorry, I have joint problems and can't really bend over.\" and she scoffs and says \"don't make up fake excuses\" and then calls me a 'lazy millennial' and said something else under her breath I couldn't quite catch, and typically I'm pretty rational but I'm already in pain and this lady struck a nerve so I said \"Don't be such a cunt\" and walked off to continue my shopping. \n\nWhen telling a friend of mine this, they said I was being an asshole to her. Personally, I don't think I was, she's the one pushing people aside and starting shit, so I figure I'd let the internet decide. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who called a woman a \"cunt\" at the grocery store is in the wrong. The situation involves someone with health issues who couldn't pick up a fallen item, and another woman got confrontational.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author has legitimate health problems that make it hard to bend down, which is clear from the detailed medical conditions mentioned. They tried to explain this to the other woman but were dismissed as making excuses. The other woman called them a \"lazy millennial,\" which is an insult. The author then called her a \"cunt\" and walked off. \n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong. The key here is the use of a derogatory term. Even if the other person was rude, responding with a swear word is unprofessional and could escalate the situation. The author might have been in pain and frustrated, which is understandable, but verbal aggression can still be seen as inappropriate, especially in a public place. \n\nOn the other hand, the other woman pushed past and was insulting, so maybe the author felt provoked. However, the author's response was a personal insult, which is a low blow regardless of the provocation. There's a difference between standing up for oneself and lashing out. The author could have chosen a different approach, like ignoring it or walking away, rather than using a derogatory term. \n\nAlso, the author's friend said they were being an asshole, which suggests that others might see the author's response as uncalled for. While the other woman was at fault for being dismissive and rude, the author's use of a swear word is still a misstep. So, even if both parties had some fault, the author's action might be considered in their wrong."
