Spinel stenosis, osteoarthritis, and my cartilage are essentially being attacked by my body and being broken down and along with this being legally blind. So with all of that, I really can't bend down, walk very far, or walk without limping for the most part. I have good days and bad days like most people my bad days however just involve me being stuck in bed until my body decides to stop hating me. \n\nNow onto today's events, I was grocery shopping, minding my own damn business just trying to get some chicken noodle soup before a damn blizzard hit and I see a package of I think taco seasoning? Idk what it was, but I asked the person in front of me if they dropped it, they said no, and I went along. Now if I could have bend down and picked it up I would have, however, if I tried to do that today there's a 90% chance I would have been stuck bend over or at least in severe pain, and falling is a real possibility for me as I'm not good with balance.\n\nAnother woman in the isle pushes past me and says \"Fine just leave it then.\", I figured she just didn't know I had joint pains or didn't notice me limping around and turned to say \"Sorry, I have joint problems and can't really bend over.\" and she scoffs and says \"don't make up fake excuses\" and then calls me a 'lazy millennial' and said something else under her breath I couldn't quite catch, and typically I'm pretty rational but I'm already in pain and this lady struck a nerve so I said \"Don't be such a cunt\" and walked off to continue my shopping. \n\nWhen telling a friend of mine this, they said I was being an asshole to her. Personally, I don't think I was, she's the one pushing people aside and starting shit, so I figure I'd let the internet decide. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called a woman a \"cunt\" at the grocery store is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has several health issues that make it hard for them to bend down or walk far. They were at the store during a blizzard trying to get supplies. They saw a dropped item, asked the person in front if they dropped it, but couldn't pick it up themselves because of their condition. Then another woman pushed past and told them to just leave it. The author tried to explain their inability, but the other woman dismissed them with a rude comment and an insult. The author responded by calling her a \"cunt\" and walked off.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's physical limitations, the other woman's pushy behavior, and the use of a derogatory term. The author's friend says they were being an asshole, but they think they're not in the wrong. The question is whether the author was wrong to say \"Don't be such a cunt.\"\n\nI need to consider if the author's response was justified. The other woman was rude and dismissive, but using a curse word in return could be seen as escalating the situation. Even if the other person was starting it, the author's choice of language is offensive and not appropriate in public. The author has valid reasons for their pain and frustration, but the response still involved a derogatory term. \n\nAlso, the author's health issues might explain their frustration, but it doesn't necessarily excuse their use of a swear word. People should communicate respectfully, even when provoked. So, while the other woman was at fault for her actions and words, the author's response was also unkind and could be seen as the wrong choice. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for using such language, even if provoked.\n"
