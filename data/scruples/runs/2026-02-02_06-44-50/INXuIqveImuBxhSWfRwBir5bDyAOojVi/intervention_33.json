Spinel stenosis, osteoarthritis, and my cartilage are essentially being attacked by my body and being broken down and along with this being legally blind. So with all of that, I really can't bend down, walk very far, or walk without limping for the most part. I have good days and bad days like most people my bad days however just involve me being stuck in bed until my body decides to stop hating me. \n\nNow onto today's events, I was grocery shopping, minding my own damn business just trying to get some chicken noodle soup before a damn blizzard hit and I see a package of I think taco seasoning? Idk what it was, but I asked the person in front of me if they dropped it, they said no, and I went along. Now if I could have bend down and picked it up I would have, however, if I tried to do that today there's a 90% chance I would have been stuck bend over or at least in severe pain, and falling is a real possibility for me as I'm not good with balance.\n\nAnother woman in the isle pushes past me and says \"Fine just leave it then.\", I figured she just didn't know I had joint pains or didn't notice me limping around and turned to say \"Sorry, I have joint problems and can't really bend over.\" and she scoffs and says \"don't make up fake excuses\" and then calls me a 'lazy millennial' and said something else under her breath I couldn't quite catch, and typically I'm pretty rational but I'm already in pain and this lady struck a nerve so I said \"Don't be such a cunt\" and walked off to continue my shopping. \n\nWhen telling a friend of mine this, they said I was being an asshole to her. Personally, I don't think I was, she's the one pushing people aside and starting shit, so I figure I'd let the internet decide. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves them calling a woman a \"cunt\" at the grocery store. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author has several health issues that make it hard for them to bend down. They were trying to help pick up a dropped item but couldn't because of their physical limitations. Another woman pushed past them and accused them of making up excuses, called them a \"lazy millennial,\" and then the author responded with a curse word.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to use that language. On one hand, the author was in pain, maybe frustrated, and the other woman was dismissive and rude. The author might feel justified because they were trying to be helpful. But on the other hand, using a vulgar term like \"cunt\" is generally considered offensive and disrespectful, regardless of the situation. Even if the other person started it, responding with a curse might escalate the conflict unnecessarily.\n\nAlso, the author's friend said they were being an asshole, which suggests some perspective. While the other woman's behavior was uncalled for, the author's response is still inappropriate in a public setting. It's a matter of how to handle conflict. Maybe a different response, like calmly explaining their situation again or ignoring the comment, would have been better. So, even though the situation isn't entirely the author's fault, their choice of words does put them in the wrong.\n"
