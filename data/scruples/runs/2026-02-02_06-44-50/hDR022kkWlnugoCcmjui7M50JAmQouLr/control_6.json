I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation is about bringing food to work specifically to mess with coworkers' diets. The person is retaliating against coworkers who are rude to them, maybe due to jealousy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is using food to undermine the diets of their coworkers. While the coworkers might be rude, is sabotaging their diets a fair response? It's a form of retaliation, which can be problematic. Also, the author is targeting specific people who are dieting, which might not be fair to others who aren't on a diet. The author mentions that others in the department appreciate the snacks, but they're focusing on the four women who are being rude.\n\nAnother angle: the coworkers' rudeness isn't justified, but does that give the author the right to take matters into their own hands? Maybe there's a better way to address the workplace issues, like talking to HR or the boss. The author's method could be seen as unprofessional and could lead to a hostile work environment. Plus, the author is manipulating their coworkers' willpower, which isn't healthy. Even if the author is doing it for revenge, it's not a constructive solution.\n\nAlso, the author is feeding others, but that's a side point. The main issue is the targeted sabotage. The coworkers didn't ask for the food, and the author is encouraging them to break their diets. It's crossing a line from kindness to manipulation. The author might think they're even the score, but it's not a professional approach. So the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
