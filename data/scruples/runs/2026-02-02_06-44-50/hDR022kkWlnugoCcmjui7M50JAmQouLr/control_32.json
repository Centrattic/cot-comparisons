I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for bringing in food to mess with their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are part of a clique that's been rude to them. The author is targeting these women who are dieting by bringing in tempting snacks, knowing that a little indulgence could break their diets. They also mention that other coworkers are benefiting from the food.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the intent. The author is doing this on purpose to wreck the diets of their rude coworkers. Even though the coworkers are being mean, using food as a weapon might be crossing a line. It's a form of retaliation, but it's manipulative and could be seen as harmful. Diets are personal choices, and undermining someone's health goals without their consent isn't really fair. Also, the author is affecting others in the department who might be trying to diet too, even if unintentionally. \n\nThen there's the aspect of workplace dynamics. The author is trying to get back at a group that's been hostile, but the method is questionable. Instead of addressing the rudeness directly or seeking a constructive solution, they're using a passive-aggressive approach. This could lead to a toxic work environment or escalate the conflict. Plus, the author mentions that others are appreciative, but the negative impact on the dieting coworkers isn't considered. \n\nSo, even though the coworkers are being rude, the author's actions might be considered unethical or unkind. It's a situation where the ends don't justify the means. The right approach would be to address the rudeness through appropriate channels, not by undermining personal choices. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
