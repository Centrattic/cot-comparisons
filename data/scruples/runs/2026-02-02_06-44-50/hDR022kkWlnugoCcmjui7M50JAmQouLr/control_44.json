I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for bringing in delicious food to the office with the intention of wrecking their coworkers' diets. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author mentions that a group of four women in the office are unnecessarily rude to them. The author believes these women are being cliquish and possibly jealous because the author is younger and earns more. In response, the author starts bringing in unhealthy snacks like cookies and pastries, encouraging the women to indulge by saying things like \"just a little piece won't hurt.\" The author notes that others in the department also appreciate the snacks.\n\nNow, the key points here are the author's intent and actions. The author's motivation is retaliation against perceived rudeness and cliquishness. They're targeting specific coworkers who are dieting by providing tempting foods to undermine their diets. However, others in the department also benefit from the snacks. \n\nI should consider if the author's actions cross a line. Deliberately undermining someone's diet could be seen as a form of bullying or revenge. Even if the food is available to everyone, the author's specific intent to target those on diets might make this behavior problematic. It's not just about sharing snacks; it's about using food as a weapon against coworkers.\n\nAlso, the author's knowledge about dieting and willpower suggests they understand the potential consequences of their actions. The fact that they see the women taking platefuls might indicate success in their plan, but that success could be at the expense of others' health goals. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is just sharing food, and the coworkers chose to partake. But the malicious intent here is a crucial factor. The question is whether it's acceptable to use food as a tool for revenge, even if others enjoy it. \n\nIn professional settings, workplace etiquette often emphasizes respect and not interfering with others' personal choices. While sharing snacks is generally positive, doing so with the specific goal of sabotaging someone's diet crosses into unethical territory. The author's actions could be seen as mean-spirited, especially if the coworkers weren't directly involved in the rudeness. The assistant who excludes the author email-wise might be part of the issue, but the author's response affects the entire group, which includes people who might not be part of the problem.\n\nIn summary, the author's intent to undermine their coworkers' diets for personal retaliation makes them in the wrong, despite the positive aspect of feeding others. The malicious intent and the targeted approach are key factors here.\n"
