I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves someone bringing in delicious food to the office specifically to undermine their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are described as being unnecessarily rude, cliquish, and excluding the author from emails.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is deliberately using food to mess with the coworkers' diets. Even though the coworkers might be rude, is it right to retaliate in such a way? The author mentions that others in the department also benefit and are appreciative, but the main intent seems to be to target those on diets. \n\nI should think about whether this action crosses a line. While the coworkers might be difficult, undermining someone's health goals could be seen as unkind, especially if the author knows dieting is a personal matter. Also, the author's motivation might be revenge for being treated poorly, but that doesn't justify malicious behavior. \n\nAnother angle is the potential consequences. If someone slips and gains weight because of the food, it might affect their health. Plus, the author's actions could escalate workplace tension. Even if the author isn't directly harming, the intent to sabotage is questionable. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworkers are being rude, so maybe the author feels justified. But is it appropriate to respond with a similar level of meanness? There's also the aspect of workplace dynamics\u2014shouldn't addressing the rudeness be done through HR or direct communication rather than passive-aggressive food tactics?\n\nI also need to consider if the author's actions are truly harmful. They are sharing food, which is a positive thing, but the intent is negative. The coworkers are making a choice to eat the food, even if influenced. But the author is actively trying to undermine their efforts, which is manipulative. \n\nIn summary, while the coworkers' behavior is bad, the author's response is likely not acceptable. It's a form of retaliation that can create more problems and doesn't address the root issue of being excluded or treated rudely. The right approach would be to handle the conflict through proper channels, not by undermining health goals.\n"
