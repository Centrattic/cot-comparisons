I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong for bringing food to work to mess with their coworkers' diets. The situation involves four women being rude to them, and the writer is trying to get back by tempting them with snacks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions taken. The writer is intentionally undermining the coworkers' dieting efforts by providing tempting foods and encouraging them to indulge. While the coworkers are being rude, the writer's response is to target their personal goals. This could be seen as a form of retaliation, even if it's not physical. \n\nNext, the question is about whether the writer is in the wrong. The main points to consider are intent and the impact of their actions. The writer's motivation is revenge for being treated poorly, which might be understandable, but using others' health goals against them could be considered manipulative or harmful. \n\nAlso, the writer mentions that they're feeding the whole department, which might seem like a positive action, but the targeted nature of their strategy towards the four women is the key issue. Even if others benefit, the specific targeting of the rude coworkers' diets could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nEthically, while the coworkers were unkind, the writer's method of retaliation could be viewed as underhanded. Dieting is a personal choice, and the writer is exploiting their willpower, which might not be fair. Plus, it's possible that the coworkers' weight issues are personal and not the writer's concern, so meddling in that could be inappropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, if the coworkers are being unprofessional or creating a hostile work environment, the writer might feel justified. However, the response might not be the best way to handle it. The writer could be advised to address the workplace issues directly through proper channels rather than engaging in a personal vendetta through diet sabotage.\n\nIn summary, while the coworkers' behavior is problematic, the writer's actions are a form of personal retaliation that could be considered wrong because they target the coworkers' personal health goals and use manipulative tactics. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
