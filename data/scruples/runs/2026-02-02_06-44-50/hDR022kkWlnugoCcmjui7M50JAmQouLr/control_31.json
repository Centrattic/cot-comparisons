I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets. The situation involves four women being rude to the author, and they've started dieting together. The author brings in snacks like cookies and pastries, knowing it might derail their diets.\n\nFirst, the author's coworkers are being rude, so there's a possible motive for retaliation. But is it justified? The author is using food to undermine their diets, which is a personal choice of those coworkers. Even if the coworkers are mean, intentionally sabotaging their health goals might cross a line. The author mentions that they know about dieting and willpower cracks, which suggests they're exploiting a vulnerability.\n\nAlso, the author is providing food for the rest of the department, which is appreciated. So there's a positive aspect, but the targeting of specific coworkers is the issue. The author is being passive-aggressive, using food as a weapon. Even if the coworkers are part of a clique and exclusionary, the author's actions could be seen as petty or harmful. It's possible the author is projecting their own insecurities or frustrations, but that doesn't excuse the behavior.\n\nEthically, it's about respect and boundaries. The author has a right to bring food, but intentionally targeting others' diets without their consent is manipulative. The coworkers might not have asked for this; they're making their own choices. The author's actions could lead to health issues or further conflict. While the coworkers are rude, the author's response isn't professional and could be considered unkind. So, the answer is likely A\u2014the author is in the wrong.\n"
