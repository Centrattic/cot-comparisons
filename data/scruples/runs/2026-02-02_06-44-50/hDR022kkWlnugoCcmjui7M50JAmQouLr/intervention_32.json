I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for bringing in food to their office to undermine their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are being rude, and the person feels excluded. They're bringing snacks like cookies and pastries, knowing the group is dieting, and encouraging them to indulge.\n\nHmm, the main issue here is the intent. The author is deliberately trying to mess with the coworkers' diets, which is a personal attack. Even if the coworkers are being unkind, is it right to retaliate by undermining their health goals? The author is also sharing food with others, so maybe there's a justification there. But the key point is that they're specifically targeting those who are dieting. \n\nAlso, using food as a weapon to break someone's willpower, even if it's their own choice to diet, could be seen as manipulation. The coworkers might not appreciate being tricked into giving up their diets. Plus, the author mentions they know a little crack can cause a flood of cravings, which adds a manipulative element. \n\nEven if there's some truth to the coworkers being cliquish and rude, the author's response is not professional. Office environments should encourage mutual respect, and this seems like a personal vendetta. The author is feeding others too, but the targeted approach towards the dieting group is problematic. \n\nSo, while the coworkers' behavior is bad, the author's method of retaliation is not appropriate. They should address the rudeness through proper channels, not by undermining others' health choices. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
