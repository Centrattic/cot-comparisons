I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for bringing in delicious food to mess with their coworkers' diets. \n\nFirst, the context: The author is dealing with a group of four women who've been rude to them since starting the job. The author speculates the reason might be jealousy because they're younger and make more money. The coworkers are dieting and eating salads, so the author brings in tempting foods to undermine their diets, using phrases like \"just a little piece won't hurt.\" They admit it's working because the coworkers take the food. The author also mentions feeding others in the department, who are appreciative.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is intentionally sabotaging others' diets. Even if the author is retaliating against perceived rudeness, is that justified? Sabotaging someone's health choices, even if they're not healthy, could be seen as crossing a boundary. Also, the author is using manipulation by knowing how to trigger cravings. \n\nAdditionally, the author is taking advantage of others' willpower weaknesses, which might be unethical. Even if the coworkers are part of a clique, the author's actions could be seen as mean-spirited. The fact that others in the department appreciate the food doesn't necessarily make it right, especially since the target group is being specifically targeted.\n\nThere's also the aspect of workplace behavior. Office politics are tricky, and seeking revenge through undermining others' health goals isn't a professional approach. The author could have addressed their issues through direct communication or HR, but instead chose to retaliate in a personal way. This could lead to a hostile work environment.\n\nHowever, the author might argue they're even-handed by feeding everyone else, but the intent here is specifically to target a group they have issues with. The key point is the intent to wreck their diets, which is a form of passive-aggressive behavior. \n\nIn conclusion, while there's a backstory of rudeness, the author's actions are harmful and unprofessional. They're using food to manipulate and undermine others, which is likely in the wrong.\n"
