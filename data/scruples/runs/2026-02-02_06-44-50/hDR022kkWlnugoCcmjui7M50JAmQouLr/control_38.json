I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing food to the office to wreck their coworkers' diets. The situation is that there's a group of four women who are being rude to the author, and they're all dieting, eating salads. The author brings in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and encourages them to eat a little piece. The author mentions that they know about dieting because their own weight fluctuates by 15 lbs. They say they're feeding the whole department and everyone seems appreciative.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions are justified. The coworkers are being rude, so the author's motivation is revenge or disrupting their diets. But is that a valid reason? The author is using food to undermine the coworkers' efforts, which might be seen as playing a prank or intentional sabotage. The coworkers are in a group that's cliquish and excluded the author from emails. The author is retaliating by making it harder for them to stick to their diets.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, even if the coworkers are being rude, intentionally undermining their health goals could be considered unkind or malicious. The author is taking advantage of their vulnerability around dieting. Plus, the author is making a comment about the coworkers needing to lose weight, which could be seen as body-shaming or passing judgment. Even if the author's own weight is a factor, that doesn't necessarily justify encouraging others to eat more if they're trying to diet.\n\nThe author also points out that other coworkers are happy with the snacks. But the specific question is about the four women. The author is targeting them by placing tempting foods in the kitchen and encouraging them to indulge. This could be seen as a form of bullying in response to being excluded. The assistant's behavior (leaving the author off emails) might be unprofessional, but the author's retaliation is also problematic. It's a cycle of negative behavior.\n\nSo, even if the author feels wronged, the act of intentionally sabotaging someone's diet isn't a constructive or appropriate response. It's more about revenge than solving the underlying issue. The correct answer would be that the author is in the wrong because their actions are mean-spirited and unprofessional, regardless of the coworkers' behavior.\n"
