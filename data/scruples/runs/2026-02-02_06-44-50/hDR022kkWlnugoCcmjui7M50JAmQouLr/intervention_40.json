I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves someone bringing food to the office to intentionally disrupt the diets of their coworkers who are being rude to them. The person is retaliating against the group of women who are excluding them by tempting them with snacks, knowing their willpower might crack.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the coworkers have been unnecessarily rude and cliquish from the start, and there's a sense of exclusion. The assistant for the boss leaves them off emails, and there's a possible reason involving jealousy. The author's motivation is revenge for being treated poorly.\n\nNow, the action in question is bringing food to undermine their diets. The author is using a strategic approach, knowing that even a small indulgence can lead to giving up on a diet. It's working because the coworkers are eating the food. However, the author is also feeding others in the department, which seems positive.\n\nThe key points here are: intent (retaliation vs. kindness), the impact on others, and whether the action crosses ethical boundaries. While the author's actions might be seen as playful or a form of revenge, they are targeting specific individuals' goals without their consent. Even though the food is available to everyone, the author's intention is specifically to mess with those who are dieting. This could be considered manipulative or malicious, especially since it's a form of harassment or bullying in response to being bullied. \n\nAlso, the author's justification is that the coworkers are being rude, but using food as a tool to undermine their diets isn't a constructive response. It doesn't address the underlying issue of workplace rudeness and exclusion. Instead, it creates a negative environment by targeting their personal choices, which might not be the coworker's fault. Plus, promoting a diet-busting culture could have health implications, even if it's not directly harmful.\n\nIn terms of office etiquette, while sharing snacks is generally acceptable, doing so with the intent to disrupt others' diets is problematic. The author should consider more appropriate ways to address the workplace issues, like talking to HR or addressing the behavior directly, rather than engaging in a form of retaliation that affects others negatively.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are a form of revenge that targets their coworkers' personal goals and could be seen as manipulative. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
