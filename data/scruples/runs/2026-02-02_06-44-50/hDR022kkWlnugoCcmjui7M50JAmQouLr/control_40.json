I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing food to work to undermine their coworkers' diets. The situation involves four women being rude to the author, and the author is retaliating by providing tempting snacks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle. The author is intentionally trying to wreck their coworkers' diets. Even if the coworkers are being rude, is it okay to take such action? Bullying or retaliation in the workplace is generally frowned upon. The author's actions might be seen as a form of revenge, which isn't appropriate regardless of the provocation.\n\nThen there's the health aspect. The coworkers are dieting, and the author is providing high-calorie foods. While the author mentions knowing about willpower cracks, intentionally weakening others' diets could be considered harmful, especially if it leads to negative health outcomes. Even if the author's intention is to get back at the rude coworkers, the method is questionable.\n\nAlso, the author is feeding the entire department, which is a positive aspect. However, the targeted approach towards the four women is the issue. The author is being selective in their actions, which creates an unfair dynamic. It's possible that others in the department appreciate the snacks, but the specific targeting of the four women for sabotage is problematic.\n\nWorkplace etiquette and respect are key here. Even if the coworkers are cliquish and rude, the appropriate response would be to address the behavior directly, perhaps through HR or management, rather than taking matters into one's own hands. The author's approach could escalate tensions and create a hostile work environment.\n\nAnother point is the assumption that the coworkers need to lose weight. The author's comment about them needing to lose 30-50 lbs each is judgmental. It's not the author's place to comment on others' bodies, and using that as a reason to undermine their diets is not justified.\n\nIn summary, while the author might feel wronged by the coworkers, the method of retaliation is inappropriate. The action crosses into bullying and could have adverse effects on the coworkers' health and morale. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
