I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing food to work to mess with their coworkers' diets. The situation involves some workplace dynamics.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that a group of coworkers are being rude to them. They're trying to get back at them by bringing in unhealthy snacks, knowing the coworkers are dieting. The author uses the excuse that others are eating the snacks too, so they're not targeting just those four women. But the intention seems to be specifically to undermine the diets of those four, right?\n\nNow, ethics-wise, is it okay to retaliate in the workplace? Even if someone is being rude, is this a fair response? The author is using food as a weapon, which could be seen as a passive-aggressive move. Also, the author is aware that the coworkers are trying to lose weight, so intentionally tempting them with snacks that could derail their efforts is manipulative. \n\nBut there's a counterpoint: the author is also feeding others in the department. But the main issue here is the targeting of those four. The author's actions are deliberate to \"wreck their diets,\" which is a personal attack on their health goals. That's crossing a line. Even if the coworkers are rude, the author's method of retaliation is unprofessional and could be considered bullying in reverse. \n\nWorkplace etiquette usually advises against personal vendettas. It's better to address the problem directly or through proper channels. The author's approach might be seen as harmful to the work environment, creating tension. Also, the author's claim that others are eating the snacks doesn't excuse the targeted behavior. The intent is to target those four, which is the issue here. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
