I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing food to the office to sabotage coworkers' diets. The author mentions that the four coworkers are rude to them and cliquish, so they're trying to get back at them by tempting them with snacks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is intentionally trying to undermine the coworkers' diets, which could be seen as a form of retaliation. Even if the coworkers are being rude, using food to mess with their dieting goals might not be fair. People have different reasons for dieting, and the author is using that against them, which could be considered mean-spirited.\n\nThen there's the impact on others. The author is providing snacks that others in the department enjoy, so maybe their intention isn't entirely malicious. But the primary target is the four women they're having issues with. The author's actions are deliberate and based on a desire for revenge, which might not be justified.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they don't know the real reason for the coworkers' rudeness. Assuming it's jealousy because of age and salary might not be accurate. Taking action without knowing the full story could be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to create a positive environment by feeding the department. However, the main issue is targeting specific individuals. Even if the author feels wronged, sabotaging others' personal goals isn't the right approach. The correct thing to do would be to address the workplace behavior issues directly or through appropriate channels, not by undermining their health choices.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's actions are a form of retaliation that affects others negatively, even if there's a good side with the snacks. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
