I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bringing in food to mess with their coworkers' diets. The situation is that the author has four coworkers who are rude, cliquish, and exclude them from emails. The author brings in snacks like cookies and pastries and encourages the coworkers to eat them, knowing that they're on diets. The author's intention is to wreck the coworkers' diets, and it seems to be working since the coworkers are eating the food. The author is also feeding other coworkers, who are appreciative.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the ethical aspects here. The main issue is whether the author's actions are justified given the coworkers' behavior. The author is being targeted by these coworkers, which might explain their desire for revenge. However, intentionally undermining someone's diet could be seen as harmful, even if the coworkers are unpleasant. \n\nBut wait, the author is doing this publicly in the office kitchen, so others are benefiting. The author isn't directly targeting just those four; it's an open snack bar. The coworkers who are on diets are choosing to eat the food, even if the author is tempting them. The question is whether it's wrong to take advantage of their willpower struggles. Also, the author's motivation is retaliation for being treated poorly. Is that a valid reason to engage in this behavior?\n\nAnother angle: The author's coworkers are adults who can make their own choices. Even if the author is encouraging them with \"just a little piece,\" the coworkers are still making the choice to eat. The author isn't forcing them. However, the author is aware that these coworkers are dieting and is using that knowledge to undermine their efforts. That could be seen as taking advantage of their situation, especially if the author's intent is to get back at them.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being excluded and treated rudely. They might feel that this is a harmless way to even the score. The author is also providing snacks for the rest of the department, which is a positive action. But the specific targeting of the four coworkers' diets could be problematic. Is it ethical to retaliate in a way that affects others' health goals, even if they've been unkind?\n\nAlso, the author's statement about knowing how willpower works suggests they understand the psychological impact of their actions. This could be seen as manipulative. Even if the coworkers are in the wrong, undermining someone's health decisions might not be justified. The author's actions could be considered a form of bullying or passive-aggressive retaliation.\n\nIn summary, while the coworkers' behavior is bad, the author's response of undermining their diets might not be the right approach. The author could be in the wrong because they're using a method that affects others' health choices, even if indirectly. The author should probably address the workplace issues through more appropriate channels rather than resorting to this kind of retaliation.\n"
