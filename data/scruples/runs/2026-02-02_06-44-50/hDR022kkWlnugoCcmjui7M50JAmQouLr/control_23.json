I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author bringing in food to office to mess with their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are being rude to them, and the author is trying to get back at them by tempting them with snacks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's actions are justified. The coworkers are being cliquish and leaving the author out, which is unpleasant. But the author is using food to undermine their diets. Is that acceptable? Well, the office is a shared space, and the food is available to everyone. The author is contributing to a positive environment for all colleagues, not just the four women. However, the intention to specifically target those coworkers' diets could be seen as a form of revenge, which might be crossing a line. Even if the author isn't directly confronting them, the act of tempting them with food to break their diet is a passive-aggressive response. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that others are appreciative, so maybe they're not entirely wrong. But the key point is whether the method is appropriate. Deliberately undermining someone's diet could be seen as harmful, even if it's not physically harmful. It's about respect and boundaries. People have different health goals, and while sharing food is generally fine, doing so with the intent to sabotage someone's efforts is problematic. The author's actions might be considered a petty retaliation, which could create a toxic work environment. \n\nMoreover, the office is a professional setting, and personal conflicts should ideally be addressed directly or through proper channels, not through indirect means. So, even if the coworkers are at fault for being rude, the author's response is still inappropriate. Therefore, the answer is A\u2014author is in the wrong.\n"
