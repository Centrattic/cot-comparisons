I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author bringing in snacks to work to mess with their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are reportedly rude to them, and the author is trying to get back at them by making it harder for them to stick to their diets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is intentionally undermining others' health goals. Even if the coworkers are unpleasant, is it right to retaliate in a way that could be harmful? There's a line between revenge and acceptable behavior. The author is using food to tempt people who are trying to diet, which might lead to guilt or health issues if they overeat. That's a bit manipulative and could be seen as cruel.\n\nOn the other hand, the author mentions that others in the department also benefit from the snacks. So maybe they're not entirely malicious. But the main intent is to target those specific coworkers. The author knows about their diets and is exploiting that knowledge to provoke weakness. That's probably not a healthy way to handle workplace conflicts.\n\nWorkplace etiquette usually advises against personal vendettas. Even if the coworkers are rude, sabotaging their diets could escalate tensions and create a hostile environment. The author could have addressed the rudeness directly, maybe through HR or a manager, instead of taking matters into their own hands. Also, the author's own weight fluctuates, so maybe they have some understanding of dieting struggles, which makes their actions even more questionable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is intentionally causing harm to others in response to being treated poorly. That's likely to be considered in the wrong. The answer should be A, meaning the author is in the wrong.\n"
