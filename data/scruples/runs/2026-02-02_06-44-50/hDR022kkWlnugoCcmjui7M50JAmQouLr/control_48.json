I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bringing in food to intentionally wreck their coworkers' diets. The scenario involves four women who have been unkind to the author. The author brings in treats, knowing these coworkers are dieting, and encourages them to indulge, leading to the coworkers eating more. The author also mentions that others in the department appreciate the snacks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle here. The author is aware that these coworkers are trying to diet and is actively undermining their efforts. Even if the author feels wronged, using food as a weapon is a form of retaliation. Workplace etiquette usually discourages personal vendettas, no matter how small the perceived slight. The author might feel justified because of the rudeness they've experienced, but it's important to assess if their actions cross a line.\n\nAnother point is the impact on others. While the author is feeding others in the department, the specific targeting of these four women with the intention to sabotage their diets could be seen as malicious. The author's actions might be creating a hostile work environment, which is against workplace standards. Intentionally undermining someone's health goals, even if they're on a diet for personal reasons, isn't typically considered acceptable behavior.\n\nAlso, the author's justification that they're helping others by providing snacks doesn't mitigate the intentional targeting of the dieting coworkers. The fact that others appreciate the food is a positive side effect but doesn't absolve the author of the negative intent towards the four women. Workplace conflicts should be addressed through appropriate channels rather than personal retaliation.\n\nAdditionally, the method of sabotage is underhanded. The author is using a tactic that preys on the willpower of others, which is a form of manipulation. Even if the coworkers end up eating more, the ethics of intentionally exploiting someone's vulnerability (like dieting) for personal satisfaction is questionable.\n\nIn terms of legal or HR policies, this might not be a legal issue, but it could be a violation of workplace conduct policies. The company might have rules against creating a disruptive or hostile environment. The author's actions could be seen as unprofessional and potentially harmful to workplace relationships.\n\nHowever, there's a counterargument that the author is simply sharing food, and the coworkers are making their own choices. But the key here is the author's intent to sabotage, which adds a malicious intent beyond just sharing. The encouragement to \"just have a little piece\" implies active participation in undermining their diets.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions, while perhaps humorous or seen as a prank, are ethically questionable because they involve using others' vulnerabilities against them in a professional setting. The intent to retaliate through undermining health goals isn't appropriate, even if the coworkers were previously rude. The correct answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
