I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the person is asking if they're in the wrong for bringing delicious food to the office to mess up their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are a group of four women who've been rude to them since they started. The person heard they're cliquish and one excludes them from emails. They think the coworkers might be jealous because they're younger and make more. The person brings in snacks like cookies, pastries, etc., and encourages the coworkers to give in to their cravings, which they seem to do. They also mention that other coworkers appreciate the snacks.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate whether the actions are right or wrong. The main issue here is whether the person is justified in their actions given the coworkers' behavior. The person is retaliating against perceived rudeness by undermining the coworkers' diets. But is this acceptable? \n\nOn one hand, the coworkers were being rude and exclusionary, which is bad. On the other hand, the person's method of retaliation is causing harm (or at least interfering with) others' personal goals. Even if the coworkers were wrong, does that justify the person's actions? Also, the person is using others' personal struggles (dieting) as a weapon. That seems underhanded. \n\nAnother angle: The person is providing snacks that others appreciate, so they're not entirely inconsiderate. But the intention here is specifically to target the dieters. Even if others benefit, the main intent is to mess with the coworkers. \n\nAlso, the person's reasoning is that they understand dieting because their own weight fluctuates. But that doesn't excuse using that knowledge to undermine others. \n\nWorkplace etiquette usually expects a certain level of professionalism. Personal conflicts should be addressed through appropriate channels, not through sabotage, even if the motive is revenge for being treated poorly. The person's actions could be seen as a form of harassment or retaliation, which is unprofessional. \n\nMoreover, the coworkers' dieting is their personal choice. The person is interfering with that, which is a violation of their autonomy. Even if the coworkers are being rude, the person's response is not constructive. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the person is likely in the wrong (A) because they're using underhanded tactics to retaliate, which is unprofessional and harmful, even if they have a grievance. The correct answer should be A.\n"
