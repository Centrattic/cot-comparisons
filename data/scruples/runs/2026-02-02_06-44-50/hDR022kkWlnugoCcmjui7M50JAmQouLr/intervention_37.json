I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves bringing food to the office to undermine their coworkers' diets. The author claims that these coworkers are rude and cliquish, and they're retaliating by bringing in tempting snacks to mess with their diets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The coworkers are supposedly being mean, so the author is trying to get back at them. But is it right to take revenge by undermining someone's health goals? Even if the coworkers are rude, does that justify the author's actions?\n\nThe author is targeting specific people who are dieting, knowing that the food might cause them to break their diets. That seems manipulative. The author is using their own knowledge of dieting against others, which could be seen as bullying or harassment. Even if others appreciate the food, the intent here is to sabotage specific individuals. \n\nAlso, workplace etiquette is important. Sharing food is generally a nice gesture, but if it's done with malicious intent towards certain people, it's problematic. The author's actions could create a hostile work environment, especially if the targeted coworkers feel singled out. \n\nThe author might be trying to fit in by sharing food but with a negative twist. However, the motivation here is revenge, not just sharing. The fact that others are eating the food doesn't absolve the author of bad intentions. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworkers being rude is a separate issue. The author might feel wronged, but retaliating in a harmful way could exacerbate the problem. The right approach would be to address the rudeness directly or seek support from management, not to take matters into their own hands.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions are unethical and unprofessional. They are targeting others with malicious intent, which is in the wrong.\n"
