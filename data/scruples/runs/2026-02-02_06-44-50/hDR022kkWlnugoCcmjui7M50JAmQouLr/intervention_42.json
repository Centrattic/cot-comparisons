I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author brings in delicious food to the office to wreck their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are a group of four women who've been rude to the author since they started a year ago. The author heard the group is cliquish, and one of them leaves them off emails for social functions. The author thinks maybe the woman in the group is jealous because they're younger and make more money. \n\nThe author has been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, etc., to the kitchen, and when coworkers hesitate, the author encourages them to take some. They mention that they know about dieting since their own weight fluctuates, so they understand how a small crack in willpower can lead to cravings. After three weeks, they notice the women take a lot of the food. The author also says they're feeding the rest of the department (20 people) and that others are appreciative.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know if that's the case. The options are A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. The main issue here is whether it's appropriate for the author to intentionally sabotage their coworkers' diets by bringing in tempting food. The author's motivation is that they've been treated rudely by this group, and they're trying to get back at them. However, their method involves affecting the entire department, not just the target group. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, even if someone is being treated poorly, it's not right to retaliate in a way that harms others who aren't part of the problem. The author is using food as a tool for revenge, which can be seen as passive-aggressive. While the author might feel justified because of the poor treatment, the method of retaliation could be considered inconsiderate or even bullying. \n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that they're feeding the entire department, and others are appreciative. However, the primary intention here is to wreck the diets of the specific group. This could be seen as a form of targeted harassment, even if it's done in a public space. The author is aware that the food is tempting and that the coworkers are on diets, so they're knowingly setting them up to fail their dieting goals. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the coworkers are adults who can make their own choices. If the food is offered to everyone and the others are enjoying it, maybe the author isn't directly wrong. But the key point is that the author is doing this with the specific intent to undermine the diets of the group that's been rude to them. This intent turns a neutral action (bringing snacks) into a targeted attack. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author is acting out of revenge complicates things. Even if the coworkers are being rude, retaliating in a way that affects others and could be seen as undermining someone's health goals (if dieting is part of a health plan) is problematic. The author's actions might also create a hostile work environment, especially if the other coworkers feel they're being targeted or if their health goals are being disrespected.\n\nAnother angle is that the author is using their position in the office to create a situation that could be stressful or harmful to others. While bringing food is common in workplaces, doing so with malicious intent crosses a line. The author might be violating workplace norms of mutual respect and consideration.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are a form of retaliation that's not only against the group that's been rude but also affects others. The intention to sabotage diets shows a lack of respect for their coworkers' choices and health goals. Even if the author feels mistreated, the method of response is inappropriate and could be considered in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
