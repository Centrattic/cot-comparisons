I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is asking if they're at fault for bringing in snacks to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author has four coworkers who are being rude to them, possibly because of jealousy. These coworkers are on a diet, eating salads. The author starts bringing in pastries and snacks, tempting them to break their diets. They mention that they know about dieting themselves, so they're using that knowledge to undermine the coworkers' willpower. The author says this is working because the coworkers are now taking the food. They also note that other coworkers (around 20 people) are enjoying the snacks too, so maybe they feel it's a benefit for everyone.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The main points here are harassment, sabotage, and the office environment. Trolling coworkers by undermining their diets could be seen as a form of retaliation or harassment. Even if the author is being playful, it's crossing a line if it's intentional to make the coworkers break their diets, especially if those coworkers are part of a group that's been hostile towards the author. The author's actions might be considered malicious because they're targeting the coworkers' personal goals (their diet) as a form of payback for the rudeness they've experienced.\n\nHowever, the author does mention that others in the department are benefiting from the snacks, so maybe they feel justified. But the key issue is the intention: the author's goal is specifically to \"wreck\" the coworkers' diets, which is a negative action. Even if others enjoy the food, the targeted behavior towards the four women is problematic. It's not just about dieting; it's about using food as a weapon to retaliate against their perceived rudeness. Office environments usually have rules about maintaining a respectful and non-hostile workplace. Sabotaging someone's diet could be seen as contributing to a hostile work environment, even if it's not a direct threat to their job.\n\nAnother angle is that the author is engaging in behavior that could be considered unprofessional. The coworkers might feel targeted or embarrassed if they give in to the temptation, leading to further tension. Also, the author's justification about being playful (\"just a little piece won't hurt\") might not excuse the intent to undermine their diets. The fact that the author is doing this on purpose, knowing the coworkers are dieting, shows a deliberate effort to disrupt their goals, which is not appropriate in a professional setting.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might feel they're being clever or even getting some form of revenge, the action is unprofessional and potentially contributes to a hostile work environment. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
