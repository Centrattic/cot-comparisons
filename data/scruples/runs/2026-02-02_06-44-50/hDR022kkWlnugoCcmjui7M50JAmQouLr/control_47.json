I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves bringing in food to the office to mess with coworkers' diets, specifically targeting a group of women who are rude to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is bringing in unhealthy snacks like cookies, pastries, and cheese platters, knowing that the coworkers are on diets. They're doing this to undermine the diets of these particular coworkers who have been unkind. The author also mentions that others in the department appreciate the snacks, which is a positive side, but the main issue is the intentional targeting of the diets.\n\nNow, evaluating whether this is wrong. The coworkers are making the author's life difficult by being rude and excluding them. The author's response is to sabotage their diets. However, even if the coworkers are being mean, retaliating by undermining their health goals could be seen as crossing a line. Sabotage, even in response to rudeness, isn't typically considered acceptable. The author is intentionally using food to weaken their willpower, which is a form of manipulation. Also, while others benefit from the snacks, the intent here is specifically to target the diets of the four women, which is a personal vendetta.\n\nAnother angle: dieting is a personal choice, and unless there's a health issue, others shouldn't interfere. The author might think they're getting revenge, but it's not justified. Even if the coworkers are part of a clique and rude, the author's actions are passive-aggressive and could be considered unprofessional. The office environment should be respectful, and sabotaging colleagues' goals isn't a professional response.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they have trust issues with these coworkers, but using food to retaliate isn't the right approach. Maybe the author should address the rudeness directly or talk to a supervisor if it's affecting work. Instead, they chose to act out in a way that affects others' health goals. That seems like the wrong action despite the provocation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because they're intentionally sabotaging others' diets in retaliation for being treated poorly, which is not an acceptable response. It's unprofessional and crosses into manipulation.\n"
