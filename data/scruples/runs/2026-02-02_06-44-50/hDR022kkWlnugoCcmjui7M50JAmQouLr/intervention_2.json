I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for bringing in food to their office to disrupt their coworkers' diets, especially targeting a group of women who are being rude to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that a group of four women have been unnecessarily rude to them since day one. They speculate that the assistant to the boss might be excluding them from emails because of jealousy\u2014since the author is younger and makes more money. The group is described as cliquish, and the author feels isolated.\n\nNow, the action in question is the author bringing in unhealthy snacks like cookies, pastries, and cheese platters, encouraging their coworkers to indulge by saying things like \"a little piece won't hurt.\" The goal is to undermine the coworkers' diets, which the author claims is working because they're eating the food. The author also notes that they're feeding about 20 other coworkers, who appreciate the snacks.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's look at possible angles. On one hand, the author is retaliating against perceived mistreatment. They feel targeted and might be trying to level the playing field or get back at the group for their rudeness. However, using others' dietary plans as a weapon could be seen as manipulative and harmful, even if the intent is to disrupt the targeted coworkers' diets. It's a form of passive-aggressive behavior that affects not just the intended targets but others who might want to stick to their diets too.\n\nAdditionally, the author's actions might have unintended consequences. If the department's other employees are also trying to maintain healthy eating habits, they might be negatively impacted. The author justifies their actions by claiming they're feeding everyone, but that doesn't make it right. The act of deliberately undermining someone's health goals, even out of spite, crosses ethical boundaries. It's a form of bullying or harassment, regardless of the motivation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is responding to a hostile work environment. If the coworkers are indeed being unkind and exclusivist, the author might feel justified in seeking some form of retaliation. However, the method chosen\u2014attacking their health goals\u2014is problematic. A more appropriate response might involve addressing the workplace hostility through proper channels rather than resorting to personal vendettas.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid reasons to feel upset, their method of retaliation is inappropriate. Deliberately encouraging others to eat unhealthy food to disrupt diets is a form of workplace harassment and is unacceptable. The answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
