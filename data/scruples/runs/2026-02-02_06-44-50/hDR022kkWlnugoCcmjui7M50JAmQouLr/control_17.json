I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about bringing food to the office to mess with coworkers' diets.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author works in an office where a group of four women are rude to them. They think the women are being cliquish and maybe jealous because the author is younger and makes more money. The author started bringing in snacks like cookies and pastries to the kitchen. They encourage the dieting coworkers to eat them, knowing that even a little might break their willpower. The goal seems to be to undermine the coworkers' diets as revenge for the rudeness.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author is targeting specific coworkers who are dieting, using their own food, and maybe manipulating them into eating. Even though others in the department appreciate the snacks, the intention here is to mess with those particular diets. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is it okay to take revenge by undermining someone's personal goals? Probably not. The author is using a form of passive-aggressive retaliation. Even if the coworkers are rude, intentionally sabotaging their efforts, even if it's not harmful, is crossing a line. It's about respect and boundaries. The author's actions could be seen as childish and unprofessional, and it might escalate tensions instead of resolving them. Also, the author mentions that they are doing this for three weeks and it's working, which implies that the coworkers are now eating the food. But is that a valid reason? Maybe the coworkers chose to eat the food, even if they're dieting. However, the author is directly trying to trigger their cravings, which is a form of manipulation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels targeted and unsupported. They might feel like they can't address the rudeness directly, so they use food as a weapon. But that doesn't justify the action. There are better ways to handle workplace conflict, like talking to HR or a manager, or setting personal boundaries. Using food to undermine others' health goals isn't a healthy resolution.\n\nAlso, consider that the author is contributing to the office environment, and others appreciate the snacks. But the intent is specific to those four women. It's a targeted action, even if others benefit. The author's behavior is rooted in revenge and not just in providing snacks for the office. So, even though the snacks are enjoyed by others, the malicious intent towards specific coworkers makes the action wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions, while perhaps understandable given the context, are not acceptable. They are crossing a line by using coworkers' personal goals against them in a manipulative way. Therefore, the answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
