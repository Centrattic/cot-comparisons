I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person who brings in food to the office is in the wrong. The scenario is that they have four coworkers who're being rude to them, and these coworkers are dieting. The author brings in treats to tempt them off their diets, which seems to be working because the coworkers are eating the food. The author also feeds the rest of the department, and others are appreciative.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the intention behind the actions. The author's goal is to mess with the coworkers' diets as a form of retaliation for being rude. That's a bit of a personal vendetta. Even if the author feels targeted, using food to undermine their diets might be seen as a bit of a childish or petty response. It's manipulating their willpower, which the author is aware of since they mention knowing about dieting from their own experience.\n\nAnother angle is the workplace environment. The author is creating a situation where the coworkers they dislike might overindulge, which could affect their health goals. But the author is also providing snacks for the whole department, which is a positive aspect. However, the intent here is specifically to target those four women. The author's actions could be seen as fostering a toxic environment by encouraging others to break their diets, even if it's not directly harmful.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the coworkers are being rude and exclusive. But using food as a weapon is a form of harassment or bullying. The author isn't addressing the root of the problem\u2014like confronting the rude behavior or seeking mediation\u2014but instead is taking revenge in a way that affects others' health choices. This could lead to potential health issues, especially if someone has dietary restrictions or medical reasons for dieting.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't forcing the coworkers to eat the food. They're making the food available, and the coworkers are choosing to take it. But the author is deliberately using psychological tactics to weaken their willpower, which is a bit manipulative. The line between sharing snacks and using them as a tool for revenge is crossed here.\n\nIn the workplace, respecting others' boundaries is crucial. Even if the author feels wronged, their method of retaliation is inappropriate. It's possible the coworkers' rudeness is due to the reasons mentioned (jealousy, cliquishness), but the author's response isn't addressing that. Instead, it's creating a more hostile environment. The author is in the wrong because they're using food as a means to get back at coworkers, which isn't a professional or respectful approach.\n"
