I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is bringing in tasty food to work to mess with their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are a group of four women who've been rude to them. The author thinks maybe the assistant is jealous because the author is younger and makes more money. The author brings in snacks like cookies and pastries, encourages the coworkers to eat them, and it seems to be working since they're eating the food. Also, the author mentions that other coworkers appreciate the snacks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is intentionally undermining the diets of their coworkers. Even though the coworkers are being rude, is it right to target their diets? The author is using food as a form of retaliation or maybe revenge. But the author justifies it by saying they're helping the entire department, not just the four women. However, the main issue is whether it's wrong to interfere with someone else's personal choices, especially their health decisions.\n\nThe coworkers are making a choice to diet, so by bringing in tempting food, the author is making it harder for them. But the author is not forcing them to eat; they're just providing options. However, the author is actively trying to undermine their diets, which could be seen as manipulative. Also, the author's actions might be considered bullying or passive-aggressive behavior, especially since there's a history of rudeness from the coworkers. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author is sharing snacks with the whole department, it's a common workplace practice. The problem arises when the author is specifically targeting the group that's been rude to them. It's possible that the author is acting out of resentment and using the food as a weapon. Even if the intention is to help others, intentionally sabotaging someone else's dieting efforts could be harmful, both physically and mentally. \n\nAnother angle is the workplace environment. If the author is creating a hostile work environment by targeting specific coworkers, that could be a problem. Even if the food is available to everyone, the intent behind it is to mess with the diets of those four women, which might be considered unprofessional or even a form of harassment. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might be in the wrong because they're using a personal vendetta to justify actions that could negatively affect others. While the coworkers were rude, the author's response is to interfere with their health goals, which is a different kind of harm. It's possible that the author is seeking revenge in a way that's inappropriate for the workplace. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's actions are likely in the wrong. They're targeting specific coworkers, using food to undermine their personal choices, and creating a potentially hostile environment. Even if others appreciate the snacks, the intent and the specific targeting of the rude coworkers makes the author's actions unethical. So the answer would be A.\n"
