I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the person is asking if they're the asshole for bringing food to work to mess with their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are being rude to them, and they're retaliating by bringing in snacks to tempt them. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is intentionally undermining their coworkers' dieting efforts. Even if the coworkers are rude, is it right to target their personal goals? The coworkers might have health reasons for dieting, so interfering with that could be seen as harmful.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that other people in the department enjoy the snacks. But they're specifically targeting the four women who are being rude. That seems like a personal vendetta. Maybe the author should address the rudeness directly instead of using food as a weapon.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworkers were already being exclusionary and cliquish. The author might feel targeted, so bringing food could be a way to get back at them. But is that justification enough? Maybe not. Retaliation isn't always the best approach, especially when it affects others' health goals.\n\nThe author also says they know dieting is hard, so they're exploiting that knowledge. That could be manipulative. Even if the coworkers are being mean, the author's actions might be crossing a line by using others' vulnerabilities against them.\n\nIn terms of office etiquette, bringing food is common, but doing it with the intent to sabotage someone's diet is problematic. The author's actions could lead to a hostile work environment or health issues for the coworkers. Plus, the author might be making the situation worse by creating more tension.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they're using others' personal goals against them for revenge, which isn't a healthy or constructive approach. The answer should be A.\n"
