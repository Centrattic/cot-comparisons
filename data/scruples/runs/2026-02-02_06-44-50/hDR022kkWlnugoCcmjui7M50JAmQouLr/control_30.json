I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is bringing in delicious food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets, specifically targeting a group of four women who are being rude to them. The author mentions that these coworkers are cliquish and leave them out of social events. The author is using food to tempt them, saying things like \"just a little piece won't hurt,\" which is working because the coworkers are now taking the food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is intentionally undermining the coworkers' diets as an act of revenge or to get back at them for their rudeness. Even though the author might feel justified because of the mistreatment, is it okay to retaliate in this way? The coworkers might not appreciate being targeted, especially if their health or personal goals are being affected. Also, the author is using the entire department's kitchen, which others also use and enjoy the snacks. But the main issue is the malicious intent behind the food.\n\nAnother angle is that the author is using their own resources and not directly harming anyone, but they are manipulating the coworkers' willpower. Dieting is a personal choice, and the author is exploiting that, which could be seen as underhanded. Plus, the coworkers might not be aware that the author's actions are targeted at them. The author is also feeding others, which might seem positive, but the negative intent towards the specific group overshadows that.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if someone is being mistreated, retaliating with similar tactics isn't typically considered the right approach. It's a cycle of negativity. The author could have addressed the rudeness directly or sought HR involvement instead of taking matters into their own hands. The fact that the author is smiling and encouraging others to break their diets shows a deliberate plan to undermine them, which is manipulative.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions are a form of retaliation that's not only targeting the coworkers they dislike but also possibly affecting others. It's a petty response that could escalate tensions and isn't a healthy way to handle workplace conflicts.\n"
