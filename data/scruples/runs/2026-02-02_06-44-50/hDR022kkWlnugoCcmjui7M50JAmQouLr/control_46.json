I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of that \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. So the situation is that the author has a group of coworkers who are being rude to them. The author thinks it's because they're younger and make more money. To get back at them, the author brings in tasty food like cookies and pastries, knowing these coworkers are on diets. They encourage the coworkers to eat the snacks, which they do, and now the author feels like they're getting revenge by making their diets harder.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is acting wrongly. The key points here are the author's intentions and the actions taken. The author is intentionally undermining their coworkers' diets, which could be seen as malicious, especially since there's a history of rudeness from the coworkers. But the author is also providing food for the entire department, which others appreciate. However, the main target here is the specific group of coworkers who've been mean.\n\nThe question is whether the author's actions cross the line into being unkind or unprofessional. Even if the coworkers are being rude, intentionally sabotaging their diets might not be the best response. It's a form of retaliation that could be considered petty or unprofessional. Also, the author is using the excuse that they're helping the rest of the department, but the main issue is with the targeted group. \n\nAnother angle is whether the author's actions are harmful. If the coworkers are trying to diet for health reasons, enabling them to overeat could have negative health consequences. Even if it's just a little indulgence, it's still interfering with their goals. Plus, the author is being confrontational by saying things like \"just a little piece won't hurt,\" which could be seen as mocking their efforts.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is responding to being ostracized and rudely treated. Maybe they feel justified in some way. But the method of retaliation is questionable. The act of bringing food for everyone but targeting specific people's diets might be seen as a sneaky way to get back at them without directly confronting the issue. It's possible that the author's actions could escalate tensions in the workplace and create a hostile environment.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the coworkers are \"unnecessarily rude\" but doesn't know the actual reason. If the coworkers have a valid reason for their behavior, the author's retaliation might not be warranted. However, even if the coworkers are in the wrong, the author's response could be considered unprofessional and inappropriate. In a workplace, it's generally better to address conflicts directly and constructively rather than retaliate in a passive-aggressive manner.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, the author is exploiting a personal weakness (dieting) to get back at people. That seems manipulative. While the coworkers are targeting the author, the author's response isn't resolving the conflict but instead creating another problem. The author might be in the wrong because their actions are harmful and unprofessional, regardless of the coworkers' behavior.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even if the coworkers are being rude, the author's method of retaliation is not appropriate. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
