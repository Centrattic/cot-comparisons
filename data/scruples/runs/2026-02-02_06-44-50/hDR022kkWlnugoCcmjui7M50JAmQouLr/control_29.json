I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves bringing food to the office to sabotage coworkers' diets. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author has a group of coworkers who are rude to them. The coworkers started dieting together, eating salads. The author brings in desserts and other snacks, encouraging the coworkers to break their diets with comments like \"just a little piece won't hurt.\" The author claims it's working because they see the coworkers eating the food. Meanwhile, the department is appreciative.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author's actions are wrong. The key points here are intent and impact. The author's motivation is revenge or retaliation against the rude coworkers. They're targeting these specific coworkers' diets, which is a personal choice. However, the author is also providing snacks that others appreciate, so there's a positive side.\n\nBut the act of intentionally sabotaging someone's diet could be seen as unethical. Even if the coworker's behavior was rude, does that justify the author's actions? Also, the author is using manipulation tactics, tempting people with food they're trying to avoid. That might be considered underhanded, even if the coworkers are being difficult.\n\nAnother angle is that the author is taking personal matters into their own hands instead of addressing the workplace issues through proper channels. Maybe they should have talked to HR or addressed the cliquish behavior directly rather than resorting to sabotage.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue that they're even-handed, since the food is available to everyone, and the coworkers brought the dieting on themselves. But the targeted approach (focusing on these women) and the mocking comments might make it personal and malicious.\n\nIn terms of office etiquette, bringing food is usually fine, but the intent here is to disrupt others' diets, which is a different matter. The author's actions could be seen as a form of harassment or bullying in retaliation, which is not acceptable in a professional setting.\n\nSo considering all this, the answer is probably A (author is in the wrong) because the actions are targeted, manipulative, and could be seen as unprofessional and retaliatory.\n"
