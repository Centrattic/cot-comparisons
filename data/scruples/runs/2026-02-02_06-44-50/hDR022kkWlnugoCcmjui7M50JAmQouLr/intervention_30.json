I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets. The scenario is about the author trying to undermine some coworkers who are rude to them.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether the author's actions are justified. The coworkers are described as being unnecessarily rude, cliquish, and excluding the author. The author is retaliating by bringing tempting food to weaken their diets. But is this the right approach?\n\nThe author mentions that others in the department appreciate the snacks, but the target group is specifically the four women who are being mean. The author's motivation is revenge or retaliation for being treated poorly. However, using food as a weapon against others' diets seems like a personal attack, even if the author thinks it's working. \n\nThere are a few angles here. Ethically, intentionally undermining someone's diet could be seen as a form of bullying or harassment. Even if the coworkers are being rude, the author's response might escalate the conflict. Also, the author's justification that they understand dieting because their own weight fluctuates doesn't mean it's okay to interfere with others.\n\nAnother point is workplace dynamics. Bringing in food is a common office practice, but doing so with the specific intent to sabotage others' diets crosses a line. It's possible that the author's actions could lead to more tension or even formal complaints. The fact that others are enjoying the snacks doesn't negate the negative intent towards the specific coworkers.\n\nMoreover, the author's approach might not address the root cause of the coworkers' behavior. Instead of dealing with the underlying issues (like being excluded from emails), the author is taking a passive-aggressive route. A more constructive approach might be to address the rudeness directly, seek support from management, or build better relationships.\n\nIn terms of fairness, even if the coworkers are at fault for being rude, the author's method of retaliation is not appropriate. The question is whether the ends justify the means. The author wants to get back at people who are being mean, but using food in this way is a form of revenge that could be harmful and unprofessional.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions are likely in the wrong. They are engaging in behavior that's intended to harm others, even if it's in response to being mistreated. The appropriate response would be to address the issue through proper channels rather than personal sabotage.\n"
