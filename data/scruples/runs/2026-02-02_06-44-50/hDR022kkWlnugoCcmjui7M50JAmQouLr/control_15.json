I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets. The scenario is that the author has four coworkers who are rude to them. The author is trying to get back at them by bringing in tempting snacks to break their diets. Others in the department appreciate the snacks, but the main issue is with those four.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author feels targeted and excluded, which is a valid feeling. But is sabotaging their diets the right response? The coworkers are on a diet, and the author is using food to undermine their efforts. Even if the author believes it's justified due to the coworkers' behavior, it's still a form of retaliation. \n\nWhat are the ethical implications here? The author is intentionally undermining the health goals of others. Even if the coworkers are rude, does that give the author the right to take matters into their own hands? Probably not. Workplace behavior should be professional. Spreading food might be seen as a small act, but it's a form of revenge and could be considered bullying or harassment. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they are feeding the entire department. While others appreciate it, the main issue is with the four women. The act of saying things like \"just a little piece won't hurt\" might be encouraging them to eat against their diet, which could be manipulative. \n\nThe coworkers being cliquish and rude is problematic, but retaliating in this way isn't appropriate. The author should address the workplace harassment through proper channels, like HR or management, instead of taking personal revenge. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions are a form of retaliation that's unprofessional and could be harmful. Even if there's a grievance, the method of response is not acceptable in a professional setting.\n"
