I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bringing food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets. The situation is that the author feels targeted by a group of four women who are being rude, and in response, the author is bringing in snacks to tempt them off their diets.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the ethics here. The author is using food as a form of retaliation. Even if the coworkers are being unfriendly, intentionally undermining their dieting efforts seems mean-spirited. It's a form of passive-aggressive behavior. The author might feel justified because of the rudeness they're experiencing, but that doesn't make the action right. Bullying or undermining others, even in a workplace, is generally not acceptable. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that other coworkers are enjoying the snacks. So, there's a positive side there, but the intent is negative. The key issue is the intent to sabotage someone else's diet. Diets can be serious for some people, and making it harder for them could have health implications. Plus, the author is using manipulation tactics like saying \"a little piece won't hurt,\" which is encouraging others to break their willpower, which isn't helpful.\n\nWorkplace dynamics are important. Even if there's a conflict, the appropriate response would be to address the rudeness directly or through proper channels, not to retaliate in a harmful way. The author's actions could escalate tensions and create a hostile work environment. So, from an ethical standpoint, the author is in the wrong because they're choosing to harm others instead of resolving the conflict constructively.\n"
