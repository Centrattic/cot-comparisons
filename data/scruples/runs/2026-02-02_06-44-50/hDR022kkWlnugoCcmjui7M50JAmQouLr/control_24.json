I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets. The situation is that the author is dealing with a group of coworkers who are being rude, and in response, they've been bringing in unhealthy snacks to tempt them off their diets. The author mentions that others in the department appreciate the food, but the main issue is targeting these specific coworkers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Deliberately undermining someone's diet choices could be seen as manipulative or cruel, even if the author is retaliating against being mistreated. The coworkers started the hostility, so the author's actions might be a form of revenge. But is revenge a valid excuse? It's a gray area. \n\nThen, there's the aspect of consent. The author is intentionally using their knowledge of dieting to exploit their coworkers' willpower. That seems underhanded. Even if the coworkers are being rude, the author's method of response could be considered bullying. Plus, the author is affecting others indirectly by feeding the entire department, which might have a positive side, but the targeted action towards the specific group is questionable.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation is to get back at the coworkers for their behavior. However, using food as a weapon might not be the healthiest or most appropriate response. It's possible that the author's actions are exacerbating the problem rather than resolving it. The coworkers might feel further targeted, leading to a worse work environment.\n\nAnother point is that the author is making assumptions about the coworkers' diets and their ability to resist. Not everyone who eats salads is dieting, and some might have health reasons for their choices. The author's approach could be seen as disrespectful to their health decisions.\n\nIn terms of workplace behavior, creating a hostile environment through actions like this is generally frowned upon. Employers usually expect a certain level of professionalism, even when dealing with conflicts. The author's actions might be seen as unprofessional and could lead to disciplinary action if discovered.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to find a way to cope with a toxic work environment. They're not directly harming anyone, just tempting others with food. But the intention here is to undermine the coworkers' diets, which is a form of sabotage. That's where the line is crossed into being in the wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their actions are manipulative, unprofessional, and potentially harmful to the targeted coworkers, even if the coworkers are rude. Retaliation in this form isn't appropriate in a professional setting.\n"
