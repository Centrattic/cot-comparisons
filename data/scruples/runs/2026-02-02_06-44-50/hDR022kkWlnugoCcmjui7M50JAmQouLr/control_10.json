I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bringing in food to mess with their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are being rude and cliquish, and the author is trying to get back at them by undermining their dieting efforts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is using knowledge of dieting and willpower to tempt their coworkers, leading them to eat foods they're trying to avoid. Even if the coworkers are being unpleasant, is it right to take revenge by manipulating their behavior? It's a form of passive-aggressive behavior, which can create a hostile work environment.\n\nThen, there's the aspect of the workplace. The author mentions that the food is available for everyone, and others appreciate it. But the main intent here is to target specific individuals. While the rest of the department benefits, the author's actions are specifically aimed at these four women. This could be seen as a personal vendetta, which is unprofessional and might exacerbate workplace tensions.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation is revenge for being treated poorly. However, using manipulation and undermining someone's health goals, even if they are overweight, is not a constructive way to handle conflict. It's possible that the coworkers have valid reasons for their dieting, such as health issues, which the author isn't considering. The author might not be aware of these reasons, leading to potential harm.\n\nAdditionally, the workplace environment is important. Creating a culture where employees feel safe and respected is crucial. The author's actions could damage team cohesion and trust. Even if the other coworkers are part of a clique, the solution should involve communication or reporting the issue rather than personal retaliation.\n\nIn summary, while the author might feel justified in seeking revenge for being excluded or mistreated, the method of doing so is unprofessional and could be considered wrong. It's important to address workplace conflicts through appropriate channels rather than taking matters into one's own hands.\n"
