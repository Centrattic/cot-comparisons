I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing in snacks to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets, specifically targeting a group of four women who have been rude to them.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that these coworkers have been unnecessarily rude since day one and that they might be cliquish. The author is retaliating by bringing in treats and encouraging the coworkers to indulge, which is affecting their diets. The author justifies this by saying they know about dieting struggles and that small cracks can lead to giving up. They also note that other coworkers appreciate the snacks.\n\nNow, considering ethical and professional behavior in the workplace. The author's actions, while perhaps a form of retaliation, might be seen as a bit underhanded. The coworkers are being targeted specifically, even though they might be eating the snacks too. The author is using others' dietary goals against them, which could be considered a form of manipulation. Even if the author feels wronged, using food as a weapon might not be the best approach. Additionally, office snacks are usually for everyone, so the author's intention to specifically target certain individuals could create a hostile work environment. However, the author isn't directly harming them; it's more about undermining their diets, which is a personal choice. But in a professional setting, such actions could foster resentment and are not conducive to a respectful workplace. Also, the author's motivation stems from being excluded and treated poorly, which adds context but doesn't necessarily justify unprofessional behavior. So, while the coworkers' actions were inconsiderate, the author's response might still be unwise and unbecoming in a professional context. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
