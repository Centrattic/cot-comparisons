I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for bringing food to work to mess with their coworkers' diets. The situation is that there are four women being rude to the author, and the author is bringing in snacks to tempt them off their diets. The author mentions that others are also eating the food and are appreciative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is intentionally undermining others' dieting efforts. That's a form of revenge or retaliation for being treated rudely. But is that acceptable? Maybe not. Even if the coworkers are being mean, sabotaging their diets isn't a constructive response. It could be seen as cruel or manipulative. Also, the author is using others' willpower issues against them, which isn't great.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is sharing food with the rest of the department, which is nice. But the intent here is specifically to target the four women. The author knows the impact of dieting and uses that knowledge to undermine them. That's a bit underhanded. The author's actions might be causing harm, like making the women feel bad about themselves or affecting their health goals. Plus, the author's coworkers might feel like the author is playing a prank, which could lead to more tension in the workplace.\n\nAlso, the reason for the coworkers' rudeness isn't fully explained. The author thinks it's jealousy, but that's an assumption. Even if it's true, revenge isn't the best approach. The right thing would be to address the rudeness directly, maybe through HR or a manager, rather than personal retaliation.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is acting in a way that's not appropriate. Sabotaging others' diets is a form of bullying or harassment, even if it's not physical. It's a petty and harmful response. Therefore, the answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
