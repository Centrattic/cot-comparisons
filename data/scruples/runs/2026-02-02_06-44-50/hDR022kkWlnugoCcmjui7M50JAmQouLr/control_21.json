I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing in delicious food to the office to wreck their coworkers' diets. The situation involves a group of four women who are being rude to the author. The author brings in snacks like cookies and pastries, knowing these coworkers are on diets, and encourages them to indulge a bit. The author mentions that others in the department appreciate the snacks too.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author's intention is to undermine the diets of the rude coworkers, which is a form of revenge. Even if the author thinks they're helping others by providing snacks, the main action is targeted at those who have been unkind. However, manipulating someone's diet choices, even if they're on a diet, isn't really the author's place. It's a bit of a passive-aggressive way to get back at them. \n\nIs it the author's responsibility to respect others' dietary goals? Yes. By bringing in unhealthy food and encouraging others to break their diets, the author is interfering with their personal choices. The coworkers might have started the diets voluntarily, so undermining that could be seen as crossing a line. Even if the coworkers are rude, the author's method of retaliation is not appropriate. \n\nAlso, the author is using their own knowledge of dieting to exploit the willpower of these coworkers. That seems manipulative. Plus, the fact that others are appreciative doesn't negate the targeted action against the specific group. The author's behavior is likely to make the situation worse, creating tension in the workplace. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworkers were being rude and exclusive, which is also wrong. But the author's response isn't about addressing the rudeness directly\u2014it's about causing harm in return. The right approach would be to address the workplace issues through proper channels or by setting boundaries, not by sabotaging their diets. \n\nSo, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because they're using manipulation and sabotage to retaliate against coworkers' rudeness, which isn't an appropriate or ethical response.\n"
