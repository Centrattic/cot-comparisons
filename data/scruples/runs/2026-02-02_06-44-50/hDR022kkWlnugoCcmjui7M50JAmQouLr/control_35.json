I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets. The situation is that the author has a group of coworkers who are being rude and cliquish, especially one who leaves them off emails. The author brings in unhealthy snacks, encouraging their coworkers to break their diet, which they started to do, and others in the department appreciate the food.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions are morally wrong or if they can be justified. The coworkers are being mean, so the author is retaliating by undermining their diet. But is that acceptable? Retaliation can be a tricky area. Even if someone is being unkind, taking revenge might not be the right approach. The author is using food as a tool to get back at them, which could be seen as bullying or mean-spirited. \n\nAlso, the author is affecting not just the target group but other coworkers who aren't involved. While others appreciate the snacks, the intention behind the food is specifically to mess with the diets of the four women. That's a targeted action, which could be considered manipulative. The author knows that even a little indulgence can break their willpower, so they're exploiting that. That seems underhanded.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of workplace behavior. The author is contributing to the office environment by providing snacks for everyone else. So maybe there's a positive aspect. However, the negative action here is the intent to sabotage the diets. Even if others benefit, the targeted sabotage is the issue. The author is using a form of emotional manipulation or psychological warfare against their coworkers.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that they don't know the exact reason for the rudeness, just that they suspect jealousy. Acting on suspicion without knowing the real reason might be premature. The author's actions could be seen as proactive retaliation without addressing the real issue. The right approach would be to confront the problem directly or seek HR help if it's a hostile work environment, not to take matters into their own hands in a harmful way.\n\nSo, the author's actions are harmful, even if they perceive it as a form of payback. The method is underhanded and affects others beyond the intended targets. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
