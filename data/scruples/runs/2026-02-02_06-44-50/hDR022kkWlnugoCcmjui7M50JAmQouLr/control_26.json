I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author bringing in delicious food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets, specifically targeting a group of women who've been rude to them. The coworkers started dieting together, eating salads, and the author is trying to derail that by offering tempting snacks.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key elements here. The main issue is whether the author's actions are justified or not. The author mentions that these coworkers are rude, cliquish, and excluded them from emails. They feel targeted because they're younger and earn more. The author's response is to bring in snacks to tempt them, knowing that dieting can be hard, and it's working because the coworkers are eating the food.\n\nNow, considering the ethical angle. The author is intentionally undermining others' health goals. Even though the coworkers might be unkind, does that justify the author's actions? Also, the author is affecting others in the department positively by providing snacks, but the primary target is the group they have a conflict with. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, intentionally sabotaging someone's diet isn't generally considered acceptable, regardless of the reason. Even if there's a history of rudeness, the response should be proportional and respectful. The author's method is a form of retaliation that's passive-aggressive and could be seen as bullying. It's possible that the coworkers might feel manipulated or disrespected, which doesn't resolve the original issue of being excluded or treated poorly.\n\nAdditionally, using food as a weapon could have unintended consequences. For example, if someone has dietary restrictions or health issues, the author's actions might be harmful. Also, creating a hostile work environment by targeting specific people, even if others benefit, isn't a healthy approach. The author should address the interpersonal issues directly, perhaps through communication or HR, rather than resorting to undermining their diets.\n\nOn the flip side, the author might feel that they're standing up for themselves against a hostile group. However, the method chosen is problematic. The fact that others in the department appreciate the snacks doesn't negate the negative impact on the targeted coworkers. The author's actions are specifically aimed at causing them to fail their diets, which is a form of personal attack.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has reasons for their actions, the method is inappropriate and unprofessional. It's inconsiderate and doesn't address the root of the problem. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
