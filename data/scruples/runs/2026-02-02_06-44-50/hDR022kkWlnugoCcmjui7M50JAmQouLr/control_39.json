I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author bringing in delicious food to the office to specifically target coworkers who are dieting, knowing that these coworkers are part of a group that's been rude to them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is dealing with a group of four women who have been rude from day one. The author hears they're cliquish, and one is an assistant who excludes them from emails. Trusted coworkers suggest the woman might be jealous because the author is younger and makes more money. The author then starts bringing in snacks like cookies, pastries, and cheese platters, encouraging the dieting coworkers to indulge, leading to them eating more. The author claims that others in the department also appreciate the snacks.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is the intent. The author mentions they're doing this to \"wreck their diets,\" which is a deliberate act of revenge or retaliation against the rude coworkers. Even though the author is feeding others and getting appreciation, the targeted action against the specific group for being rude is a form of payback, which could be seen as a petty or vindictive act.\n\nBut the author also mentions that the coworkers are being rude without clear reason, and that the author is being excluded. The act of bringing in snacks might be seen as harmless unless it's a targeted attack. However, the author is using the food as a weapon to undermine the diets of those who are being rude, which crosses the line into malicious intent. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author was just bringing in food for everyone and the others happened to indulge, that might be different. But the author specifically targets the dieting coworkers, uses tactics to tempt them, and sees it as a success when they eat the food. This targeted behavior, even if it's within the bounds of social norms (like sharing snacks), is done with the intent to retaliate, which makes it problematic.\n\nAlso, workplace ethics usually emphasize maintaining professionalism. Retaliating in this way, even for perceived slights, can escalate conflicts and create a hostile environment. The author's actions might be considered unprofessional and potentially harmful to the work atmosphere.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author's actions are justified. The author feels targeted and is trying to level the playing field. However, the method chosen\u2014undermining their diets\u2014is not a professional or constructive response. There might be better ways to address the rudeness, like direct communication or HR involvement, rather than using food as a tool for revenge.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention to share food is positive, the targeted and malicious intent behind it to harm specific coworkers (even if they're being rude) makes the author responsible for creating a hostile work situation. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
