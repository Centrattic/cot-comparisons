I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is bringing in food to the office to mess with four coworkers' diets because they're being rude to her. The coworkers are part of a clique and have been unfriendly since day one. The author brings cookies, pastries, etc., and encourages them to eat a little, which seems to be working as the coworkers take the food. Meanwhile, the rest of the department is happy with the snacks.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the author is wrong. First, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is targeting specific coworkers who are allegedly being rude to them. The action is intended to undermine their diets, which is a form of retaliation. But is that justified? The author mentions that they're not in the office to be mean, but the coworkers are being excluded from emails and are cliquish. \n\nOn one hand, the author is using the snacks to make the workplace less pleasant for those four, which could be seen as a form of bullying or revenge. Even if the author isn't directly aggressive, the act of tempting someone's diet could be considered a form of harassment. Also, the author is affecting others indirectly, but the rest of the department is happy. However, the four coworkers are the ones being targeted for a specific reason. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author is responding to being mistreated. They feel excluded and are trying to get back at the people who are being rude. The author might feel that this is a harmless way to even the playing field. However, manipulating others' diets in the workplace isn't a typical or acceptable way to handle conflict. \n\nAnother angle is that the author is using their own resources to do this, so there's no direct harm beyond the dietary sabotage. But the coworkers might feel disrespected or targeted. Also, the author is exploiting their knowledge of willpower and dieting to undermine others, which could be seen as underhanded. \n\nThe fact that the assistant is excluding the author from emails for social functions adds to the tension. The author might feel justified in their actions because of the mistreatment. However, the method is questionable. In a professional setting, resolving conflicts through such tactics isn't considered appropriate. The author should probably address the issue directly, perhaps through HR or management, rather than resorting to sabotage. \n\nSo, the consensus here is that while the author might have valid grievances, the method used to address them is inappropriate. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions are a form of retaliation that targets specific coworkers in a way that's unprofessional and could be considered harassment.\n"
