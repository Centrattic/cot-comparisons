I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves bringing in food to the office to specifically tempt their coworkers who are dieting, which is causing the coworkers to eat the food. The question is whether this is justified or not.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's coworkers are being rude to them, possibly due to jealousy. The author brings in snacks like cookies and pastries, knowing the coworkers are on diets. They use phrases like \"just a little piece won't hurt\" to encourage them to break their diets. The author also mentions that others in the department appreciate the food.\n\nNow, considering office etiquette and ethics. Even if the coworkers are being rude, is it okay to retaliate by undermining their diets? The author is intentionally targeting these coworkers' willpower, which could be seen as manipulative. While sharing food is generally nice, doing so with the specific intent to mess with others' diets crosses a line. It's a form of revenge or sabotage, which is typically considered unprofessional and could lead to a hostile work environment.\n\nAlso, the author is using their own experience with dieting to justify their actions, but that doesn't make it right. The coworkers' health choices are their own, and the author has no right to interfere, even if there's a personal vendetta. The fact that others appreciate the food is a separate point; the targeted harassment of specific coworkers is the issue here.\n\nSo the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their actions are malicious and unprofessional, regardless of the coworkers' behavior towards them. The appropriate response would be to address the rudeness through proper channels, not by sabotaging their diets.\n"
