I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is bringing in tasty food to the office specifically to help their coworkers break their diets. The coworkers are a group of four women who've been rude to them, and the author thinks they can stand to lose weight. The author uses a bit of psychological manipulation by saying things like \"just a little piece won't hurt\" to entice them.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the ethics here. The author's main motivations are revenge or retaliation against coworkers who've been rude to them and possibly trying to undermine their diets. But is that justifiable? Even if the coworkers are unfriendly, does that give the author the right to interfere with their health goals?\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, there's probably no issue, but ethically, it's more complicated. The author is using others' potential dieting habits against them, which could be seen as a form of bullying or sabotage. Even if the food is available to everyone, the author is specifically targeting the rude coworkers, maybe to get back at them for being excluded or mistreated. However, the author also mentions that others in the department appreciate the snacks, so there's a positive side too.\n\nBut the key point is the intention. The author isn't just providing snacks; they're doing it with the intent to wreck the dieters' plans. That makes it more about retaliation than sharing. It's not a healthy way to handle conflict. The author might have valid grievances, but undermining others' health goals isn't the right approach. It could lead to more tension in the workplace and might not be respectful of others' choices, even if they are being rude.\n\nAlso, the author's method of manipulation by saying \"just a little piece won't hurt\" could be encouraging unhealthy behavior, even if the food isn't bad. It's playing on their willpower in a sneaky way. That seems underhanded. Even if the author is doing this as a form of revenge, it's not a constructive solution. The right approach would be to address the rudeness directly or seek support from management, not to engage in counterproductive behavior.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because their actions are a form of retaliation that's unethical and could harm the workplace environment. Even though the coworkers are rude, the author's method crosses a line.\n"
