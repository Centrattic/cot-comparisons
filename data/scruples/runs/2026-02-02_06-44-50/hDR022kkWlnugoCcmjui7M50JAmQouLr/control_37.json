I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author bringing in delicious food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are described as rude and cliquish, and the author is retaliating by tempting them with snacks, which seems to be working since the coworkers are giving in to the food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The coworkers are being unnecessarily rude to the author from day one, forming a clique, and excluding them from social events. The author heard that the assistant to their boss (part of the group) might be jealous because the author is younger and earns more. The author's response is to bring in indulgent foods to undermine their diets, knowing that it's hard to resist just a little. However, they also mention that other coworkers are benefiting from the snacks and are appreciative.\n\nNow, looking at the ethics here. The author is using others' dietary habits as a form of retaliation for being treated poorly. While the coworkers' actions (being rude, excluding) are clearly wrong, the author's response could be seen as manipulative. By exploiting their willpower and dieting efforts, the author is not only taking advantage of their vulnerabilities but also potentially harming their health goals. Even if the author is also dieting, that doesn't justify undermining others. The intent here is to get back at the coworkers, which could be considered a form of bullying or passive-aggressive behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't directly harming the coworkers; they're just tempting them with food. However, the key point is the intent. The author is aware that their actions are causing the coworkers to give in to cravings, which is a deliberate act of sabotage. Even if others in the department are enjoying the snacks, the targeted coworkers are the ones being specifically targeted for retaliation. The author is using food as a weapon against a group that has been hostile, which, while understandable as retaliation, isn't the most constructive or ethical approach.\n\nIn terms of workplace ethics, it's generally discouraged to retaliate against coworkers, even if they've been rude. The appropriate response would be to address the behavior through proper channels or to focus on professional conduct. The author's method of retaliation could lead to a hostile work environment or escalate conflicts. Therefore, even though the coworkers started it, the author's actions are still problematic because they're taking it upon themselves to manipulate others' health goals as revenge.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions, while perhaps a response to bullying, are harmful and not a professional way to handle the situation.\n"
