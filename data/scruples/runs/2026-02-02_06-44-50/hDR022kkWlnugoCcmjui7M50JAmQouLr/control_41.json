I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves bringing food to the office to undermine a group of coworkers' diets, which they find rude. The author mentions that these coworkers are being unnecessarily rude to them, possibly due to jealousy. They started bringing snacks to entice the group to eat despite their diets, and others in the department are happy with the food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The main question is whether intentionally sabotaging someone's diet is justified as revenge for being treated rudely. The author's actions are targeted at specific individuals who are part of a clique that's been unkind. However, using others' dietary habits as a weapon might be seen as crossing a line, even if the intent is retaliation.\n\nThen, there's the aspect of workplace behavior. The office environment should ideally be respectful and inclusive. The author's actions could be seen as a form of passive-aggressive retaliation, which might not be the best way to handle interpersonal conflicts. Instead of addressing the root issue (the coworkers' rudeness), the author is taking a more indirect approach, which could harm team dynamics.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that other employees are benefiting from the snacks. While that's a positive, it's a side effect rather than the main intention. The primary goal is to mess with the diets of the specific group. That could lead to resentment if the group feels targeted, even if others enjoy the snacks.\n\nMoreover, the author's justification that they understand dieting struggles because their own weight fluctuates might not absolve them. Using that knowledge to undermine others isn't fair. Everyone's dietary choices are personal, and pressuring someone to eat against their will, even in a teasing manner, could be considered manipulative.\n\nWorkplace policies and respect are important. The appropriate response to being treated rudely would be to address the behavior directly, perhaps through HR or a manager, rather than engaging in similar unprofessional behavior. The author's actions, while creative, don't resolve the underlying issue and might escalate tensions.\n\nIn conclusion, even if the author has valid reasons for feeling targeted, their method of retaliation is unprofessional and could be seen as contributing to a hostile work environment. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
