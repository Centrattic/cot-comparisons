I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is bringing in delicious food to the office specifically to mess with their coworkers' diets because they're being rude to her. The coworkers are part of a clique that's been unfriendly since day one. The author says they're all trying to lose weight and she's tempting them with snacks, knowing that even a small indulgence can lead to giving up on their diets. She's been doing this for three weeks and now sees them taking the food.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong here. The user thinks she is, but wants to know my take. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's coworkers are dieting, and she's bringing in tempting foods. But she's also feeding others in the department. The coworkers are being rude to her, possibly due to jealousy over her age and salary. The author's motivation is revenge for their rudeness. \n\nNow, is it ethical to retaliate by undermining their diets? Well, diets are personal choices. Even if the coworkers are being jerks, the author is using their dietary goals against them. But is it her place to interfere? She's not forcing them to eat, just making the food available. But she's doing it with the intent to hurt their willpower, which is a bit manipulative. \n\nAlso, she's justifying it by saying others appreciate the snacks. But the targeted coworkers are specifically the ones she's targeting. Even if others like the food, she's using it as a weapon against her enemies. That's a form of bullying or passive-aggressive behavior. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworkers are being rude and excluding her. Maybe she feels she has no other recourse. But workplace conflict should be addressed through appropriate channels, not by undermining others' health goals. \n\nSo, the author is retaliating in a way that affects others' personal choices. Even if the coworkers are in the wrong, her actions are crossing a line. She's using a personal vendetta to influence their decisions, which isn't fair. Therefore, the answer is A\u2014she's in the wrong.\n"
