I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong for bringing in food to disrupt their coworkers' diets. The scenario involves the author bringing in treats like cookies and pastries to the office kitchen, knowing that four coworkers are on a diet. The author's intention is to undermine these coworkers' diets, possibly as retaliation for being rude and excluded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions and motivations. The coworkers were already being mean and excluding the author, so the author's actions might be seen as revenge. But is that a valid reason? Retaliation is generally frowned upon. Then there's the impact on others. The author mentions feeding the whole department, which others appreciate. However, the main issue is targeting specific coworkers. Even if others like the snacks, the author is intentionally trying to mess with the diets of those four women. That's a personal attack, which is unprofessional. Also, using food to undermine someone's health choices could be seen as crossing a line, even if the author knows about dieting. The method is manipulative\u2014knowing a little indulgence can break willpower. Plus, creating a hostile work environment by targeting specific coworkers could be a problem. The author might be trying to assert control or get back at them for the rudeness, but that doesn't justify the action. The company might have policies against such behavior. Even if the other coworkers are doing something the author doesn't like, the response should not be harmful or disruptive. So, while the coworkers are being rude, the author's actions are not appropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
