I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about bringing in delicious food to the office to mess with their coworkers' diets. The coworkers are part of a group that's been rude to the author, and the author knows they could stand to lose some weight. The author brings snacks like cookies and pastries and encourages the coworkers to indulge, leading them to eat more than a little. Others in the department also enjoy the snacks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The coworkers are on a diet, so intentionally undermining their efforts could be seen as harmful. Diets can be important for health reasons, and sabotaging them might prevent the coworkers from achieving their health goals. Even if the coworkers are rude, does that justify the author's actions? Also, the author is bringing food for the whole department, which is generally a positive thing. But the intent here is to specifically target those on diets, which might cross a line.\n\nThen there's the issue of consent. The coworkers might not appreciate having their diets disrupted, especially if it's not their choice. The author is taking advantage of their willpower struggles, which could be manipulative. Even if others are happy with the snacks, the author's motivation is to \"wreck\" specific coworkers' diets, which is a negative intent towards others. \n\nAdditionally, the author's own weight fluctuates, which gives them some insight into dieting challenges, but that doesn't necessarily make their actions right. It's possible the author is projecting their own experiences onto these coworkers, but the key is whether it's acceptable to interfere with others' health decisions, even in retaliation for rudeness. \n\nThe coworkers' rudeness doesn't justify the author's behavior. Retaliation in the workplace can create a toxic environment. The author might be trying to get back at them for being excluded from emails and being part of a clique, but that's not a valid reason to act on another person's health choices. \n\nSo, even though the snacks are appreciated by others, the intent to undermine specific coworkers' diets is problematic. The author is not respecting their autonomy and health goals. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
