I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is bringing in delicious food to the office to wreck their coworkers' diets, specifically targeting a group of four women who are being rude to them. The author mentions that these coworkers are dieting and eating salads, and the author is trying to undermine their diets by offering tempting snacks. However, they also say that other people in the department are enjoying the food.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the ethics here. The main issue is whether the author is justified in their actions. The coworkers are being rude, and the author is retaliating by tempting them to eat their diets. But is that acceptable? The author is using food as a weapon, which could be seen as a form of revenge. Even if the coworkers are mean, sabotaging their diets might not be the right approach. Dieting is a personal choice, and the author is interfering with that, which could be considered manipulative or even harmful. \n\nAlso, the author is bringing food for everyone else, but specifically targeting the rude group. The problem is that while others appreciate the snacks, the author's intent is to disrupt the diets of the four women. This could lead to health issues if those women are relying on their diets for medical reasons. Plus, the author's motivation is revenge, which is a negative reason to act. \n\nAnother angle is the office environment. The author is in a professional setting, and bringing food can be a positive gesture. However, using it as a tool for retaliation introduces a negative dynamic. The author's actions might create a hostile work environment, which is not appropriate. Even if the coworkers are mean, the author should address the issue through proper channels rather than personal sabotage.\n\nThe author might think they're getting back at the coworkers for being rude, but this approach could backfire. It might lead to further conflict, damage professional relationships, or even result in disciplinary action if others find out the intent. The author's method of retaliation isn't constructive; it's more of a petty revenge that could have unintended consequences.\n\nIn terms of ethical standards, causing harm to others, even if they're being unkind, isn't generally considered acceptable. The author should consider speaking to HR or a manager about the behavior of the coworkers instead of taking matters into their own hands. The fact that the author is taking advantage of others' willpower weaknesses also shows a lack of empathy. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are a form of retaliation that's harmful and unethical, even if the initial mistreatment is real. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
