I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing in food to mess with their coworkers' diets. The situation is that the author has a group of coworkers who are being rude to them. The author is trying to get back at them by providing tempting snacks, knowing that the coworkers are on diets. The author claims it's working because the coworkers are eating the food, while others in the department appreciate the snacks.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions are justified. The coworkers are reportedly rude and exclusionary, leaving the author off emails. The author is retaliating by undermining their diets. But is this ethical? On one hand, the coworkers are being unkind, so the author might feel they have a reason to respond. But the action of intentionally sabotaging their diet, even if it's through temptation, could be seen as mean-spirited. It's a form of revenge that affects others, even if the author isn't directly causing harm. However, the author is also providing snacks for others, so maybe they're not entirely malicious.\n\nBut the key point is the intent to \"wreck\" their diets. Dieting is a personal choice, and even if the coworkers are rude, the author is targeting them specifically by preying on their willpower. This could be considered a form of bullying or passive-aggressive behavior. The author might be justified in wanting to stand up for themselves, but using food as a weapon to undermine others' health decisions isn't a constructive approach. It's more about getting back at them in a way that's not professional. The author's coworkers might have issues, but that doesn't give the author the right to retaliate in a way that affects their health goals. Also, the author's motivation here is revenge rather than addressing the actual problem of being excluded or treated rudely. So, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong because they're engaging in unprofessional and harmful behavior, even if there's a reason.\n"
