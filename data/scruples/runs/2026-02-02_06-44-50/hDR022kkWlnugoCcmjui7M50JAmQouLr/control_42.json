I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author bringing delicious food to the office to specifically target their coworkers' diets as a form of revenge for being rude to them.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the scenario. The author is part of a group where four women have been unnecessarily rude from day one. They're described as cliquish, and one is leaving the author off social event emails. The author suspects jealousy because they're younger and make more money. Now, the author is bringing cookies, pastries, etc., to the kitchen, encouraging the coworkers to indulge, which is causing them to eat despite their diets. The author sees this as a way to get back at the women for their behavior. However, the author also mentions that other coworkers are benefiting and are appreciative.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider ethical perspectives here. The author is retaliating against perceived bullying or meanness by undermining their diets. But is that justified? On one hand, the coworkers were rude and maybe even intentionally exclusionary. On the other hand, the author is intentionally causing harm (to their diets) which could be seen as mean-spirited. \n\nBut wait, the author's actions also benefit others in the department. They're providing snacks that others appreciate. However, the primary intent here is to mess with the specific group's diets. The question is whether that intent makes it wrong. \n\nIn terms of office dynamics, office politics, and workplace ethics, is it acceptable to take revenge by undermining someone's personal health choices? Even if the coworkers were rude, is it okay to retaliate in this way? Also, the author mentions knowing about dieting and how willpower can crack, so they're using that knowledge to their advantage. \n\nAnother angle: the author is not forcing the coworkers to eat the food. They're offering it, and the coworkers are making the choice to take it. The author is just providing the temptation. Does that make it their fault? Or is it the coworkers' own lack of self-control? \n\nBut the author is doing it with a malicious intent, knowing that it's against the coworkers' goals. So even if they're not forcing it, they're deliberately setting up a situation to cause them to fail in their diets. That could be seen as wrong because it's using manipulation to retaliate instead of addressing the issue directly. \n\nAlso, the author's approach might be exacerbating the problem. Instead of trying to build a better relationship or address the rudeness through communication, they're taking a passive-aggressive route. This could lead to a toxic work environment or escalate conflicts. \n\nMoreover, the author is targeting specific individuals, which could be considered bullying in itself. Even if others are benefiting from the snacks, the intent is harmful towards those four women. That's a problem. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is punishing the coworkers for their own choices. The coworkers are on diets, and the author is exploiting that. It's not about respecting their health goals but about getting revenge. \n\nAnother point: the author's justification is that the coworkers are being rude, but that doesn't necessarily give them the right to retaliate in this manner. There might be more appropriate ways to handle the situation, like discussing with HR, building alliances with other coworkers, or not engaging with the group. \n\nIn summary, even though the coworkers were rude, the author's method of retaliation is inappropriate. It's using food as a weapon in a workplace, which isn't a healthy way to resolve conflicts. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
