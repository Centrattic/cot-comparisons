I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for bringing in food to wreck their coworkers' diets. The situation is that the author is dealing with a group of four women who are being rude to them. The author thinks it's because they're jealous of their age and salary. To get back at them, the author brings in unhealthy snacks, knowing these coworkers are dieting. The author encourages them to eat a little bit, knowing it might lead to overindulgence. However, other coworkers are also enjoying the food.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author is wrong. Let me break this down. The author's intention is to target those who are dieting, maybe as a form of retaliation for the rudeness. But is it ethical to use food as a tool to undermine someone's diet? The coworkers are making a conscious effort to diet, so by providing tempting food, the author is making it harder for them. Even if the author is also dieting, that's a different context. The author's actions are deliberate and could be seen as a form of sabotage, which might not be appropriate in a workplace setting.\n\nMoreover, the author is affecting other coworkers who aren't part of the conflict. The 20 people who appreciate the snacks might not be aware of the targeted intention. The author is indirectly punishing the four women by creating a situation where they might relapse. This could be considered manipulative. Even if the author feels wronged, using food as a weapon is not a professional or healthy approach. It's possible that the author's actions could lead to a more hostile work environment or even health issues for the dieters. Also, the assistant leaving the author off emails is a separate issue that might require addressing through proper channels rather than personal retaliation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that they're being targeted unfairly and are using humor or light-hearted teasing (\"just a little piece won't hurt\") to undermine the diets. But humor can be a thin line, especially when it's at someone's expense and knowing it affects their health goals. The author's actions could be seen as crossing into bullying or creating a hostile work environment. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
