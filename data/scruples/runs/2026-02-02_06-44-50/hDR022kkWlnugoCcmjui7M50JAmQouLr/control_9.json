I really have no idea why. They were like that to me from the first day I started my job (have been there for a year). I heard they are known to be extremely cliquish. One of the women is the assistant for my boss and purposely leaves me off emails for social functions. I asked a couple of trusted coworkers what her deal is with me and they just shrug and think she\u2019s jealous since I\u2019m younger than her and make more money. I really have no idea if that\u2019s the real reason though.\n\n\nAnyway this group of women can all stand to lose 30-50 lbs each. They all started dieting together and would eat salads for lunch. I\u2019ve been bringing in cookies, pastries, cheese platters, and putting it in our department kitchen. If any of those coworkers show signs of hesitation, I smile and say shit like, \u201cOh just a little piece won\u2019t hurt.\u201d I\u2019m no stranger to dieting (weight fluctuates between 15 lbs) so I know just a tiny crack in willpower can create a flood of powerful cravings. I\u2019ve only been doing this for three weeks but I think it\u2019s working because I always see these women get a plateful of whatever food I bring.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I am feeding the rest of my department (about 20 other people) indirectly and everyone seems appreciative of my snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Ask Me Anything (AMA) is in the wrong for bringing in food to wreck their coworkers' diets. The situation is that the four women in the office are being rude to them, and the author is trying to undermine their diets by bringing in snacks. The author thinks it's working because the women are eating the food, and other coworkers are happy with the snacks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's actions are appropriate. The author mentions that the women have been unnecessarily rude since day one, and maybe they're being cliquish. The author is retaliating by bringing in food to break their diets. But is that justified?\n\nThe key points here are intent and workplace behavior. The author's intention is to sabotage the diets of these coworkers, which could be seen as mean or retaliatory. Even if the author is trying to even the score after being treated poorly, undermining someone's diet can have health implications. Diets are personal choices, and while the author might have some knowledge about dieting, intentionally tempting someone to eat against their plan isn't a healthy or supportive approach in the workplace. \n\nAlso, using the office kitchen to provide food for everyone else is a positive action, but the targeted approach towards the four women turns it into a personal vendetta. The author is being manipulative by encouraging the women to eat, which might not only affect their diets but also their self-esteem or health goals. Even if the author feels they're in a position where they're being unfairly treated, the method of retaliation is questionable.\n\nThere's also the aspect of workplace professionalism. The author's actions could lead to a hostile work environment, even if it's just through food. The coworkers who are being targeted might feel humiliated or that their health goals are being mocked. Additionally, the other coworkers who are eating the food might not be aware of the author's specific intent, but the targeted approach could lead to tension.\n\nOn the flip side, the author might feel justified given the rudeness from the coworkers. However, the solution is not the right one. The appropriate response would be to address the rudeness through proper channels, like HR or a manager, rather than using food as a weapon. The author is taking a passive-aggressive approach that could escalate the conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, while the coworkers might have been unkind, the author's method of retaliation is inappropriate. The author is in the wrong because they're using a manipulative tactic that affects not only the targeted individuals' health goals but also the workplace dynamics. The answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
