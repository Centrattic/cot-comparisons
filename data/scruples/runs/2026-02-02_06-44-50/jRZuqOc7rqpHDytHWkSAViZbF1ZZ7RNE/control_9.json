As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about doubting his girlfriend's reported intolerances to gluten, lactose, and sugar, which he finds rare. He's been skeptical and trying to get her to test these again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. If she's telling him she has these intolerances, she might be genuinely experiencing symptoms. Even if it's rare, it's not impossible. Maybe she's been diagnosed by a doctor. The author is questioning her claims and suggesting she try these foods again, which could be dismissive of her health concerns.\n\nThe user mentions friends suggesting he secretly give her these foods to test, but he's against that as it would break trust. That shows he has some ethical consideration, but his probing might still be harmful. If the girlfriend is uncomfortable or if her health is at stake by ignoring her restrictions, the author's actions could be seen as undermining her well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern might be valid if there's a possibility of misunderstanding or misdiagnosis. However, the approach of doubting and encouraging her to consume things she's allergic to could be risky. Trust in a relationship is crucial. Even if his intentions are good (wanting her to have a less restricted diet), the method of challenging her without her consent might not be respectful.\n\nAlso, the author's comparison to mothers who falsely claim their children are intolerant might be a stretch. Everyone's body is different, and personal experiences with food sensitivities can vary. The author shouldn't assume bad faith without evidence.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships require mutual respect and trust. If the girlfriend feels her needs are being doubted, it can cause emotional harm. The author's actions, while maybe coming from a place of wanting to help, could be seen as dismissive or not taking her health seriously. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for doubting her without valid reasons and pushing her to consume what she claims are problematic for her.\n"
