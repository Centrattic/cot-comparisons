As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances. The girlfriend claims to have gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author finds rare. He's heard stories about parents misdiagnosing their kids, so he's skeptical. He's trying to get her to test these again, maybe to reverse her restrictions, and some friends suggested sneaking it into her food, which he refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the validity of the author's skepticism. While it's true that some people might self-diagnose or have psychosomatic symptoms, the author is questioning his partner's health without medical evidence. His approach could be seen as dismissive of her actual health concerns. Even if there's a possibility she developed these later, it's important to respect her current condition unless there's proof otherwise.\n\nThen, the method of testing\u2014encouraging her to try gluten or lactose again could be harmful if she genuinely has an intolerance. Forcing her to consume these without her consent could cause physical discomfort and break trust. The author's friends' suggestion to sneak it into her food is clearly unethical, but the author is against that, which is a positive point. However, his own approach of urging her to try might still be problematic if done without her agreement.\n\nTrust and communication are key in relationships. The author's doubt might undermine her trust in him. Even if his intentions are to help her eat more freely, he should approach this with care and support her in seeking medical validation rather than pushing her to test her own limits. The fact that he's concerned about crossing a trust line by sneaking it shows he has some awareness, but his current approach could still harm their relationship if she feels her health is being doubted.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't necessarily malicious, but his actions could be hurtful. The correct approach would be to support her in consulting a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and testing, rather than doubting her experiences directly. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not respecting her health claims and possibly pressuring her to consume things that might be harmful.\n"
