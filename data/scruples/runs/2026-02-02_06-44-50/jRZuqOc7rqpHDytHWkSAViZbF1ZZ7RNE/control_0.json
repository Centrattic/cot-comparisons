As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about doubting his girlfriend's reported intolerances to gluten, lactose, and sugar. He's skeptical because these are rare together and has heard stories of parents overreacting. He's trying to get her to try those foods again, even suggesting friends should secretly test her reactions. But he's conflicted about crossing trust boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend claims to have multiple intolerances. The author is skeptical and wants her to test them. But is his approach right? Well, questioning the validity of her conditions might come off as dismissive. Even if it's rare, it's not impossible. People can develop intolerances later in life, though that's less common. His friends' idea to secretly test her reaction is definitely crossing a trust line, but he's against that, which is good. However, his probing and urging her to try the foods might be seen as undermining her health choices. Trust in a relationship is important, so if he's not respecting her decisions without evidence, he could be in the wrong. On the other hand, if he's genuinely concerned and wants her to confirm the diagnoses, maybe he's trying to help. But pushing someone to eat things they avoid because of health issues can be harmful. Also, there's a difference between skepticism and respecting her choices. If he's not providing evidence to question her claims, just doubting without reason, that's unkind. So the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not respecting her health decisions and is being dismissive without proof. But maybe B if he's just concerned and trying to help. Hmm. Need to balance medical validity and relationship trust.\n"
