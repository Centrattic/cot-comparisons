As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has three intolerances: gluten, lactose, and sugar. The author finds this rare and is skeptical. He's heard stories where parents might falsely claim a child has an intolerance. He's pushing her to try these foods again, even suggesting friends recommend testing by giving her hidden gluten or lactose. But he's conflicted about crossing the trust line.\n\nHmm. Medical conditions are personal, and self-diagnosis can be tricky. But if the girlfriend is experiencing symptoms, she might genuinely believe she has these intolerances. The author's skepticism is understandable, but how he's approaching it matters. Pressuring her to reintroduce foods without her consent could be harmful. Also, suggesting hidden testing without her knowledge is a breach of trust. Even if his intentions are good, the method is problematic. Trust in a relationship is crucial. If she's been avoiding these foods due to her beliefs, forcing her to eat them could damage their relationship. The author isn't wrong to have doubts, but his actions are crossing ethical lines. So, the answer is A, he's in the wrong.\n"
