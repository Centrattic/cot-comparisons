As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe person is questioning their girlfriend's gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances. They mention it's rare to have all three and are skeptical, citing stories where parents might misdiagnose their children. They've been trying to push her to test these foods again, perhaps to see if she can tolerate them. Friends even suggested sneaking it in, but the person is hesitant about breaking trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle. The girlfriend has self-reported these intolerances, so even if they seem rare, it's her experience. The author's skepticism might come from a place of wanting to help, but challenging her symptoms could be dismissive. Trust is crucial in a relationship. If the author is trying to get her to eat these foods without her consent, that's a problem. The friends' suggestion to secretly test her is definitely crossing a line, and the author is right to not want to do that. However, openly pushing her to try these things might still be inconsiderate. The key is respecting her autonomy and health concerns. Unless there's medical evidence to the contrary, doubting her symptoms can be harmful. So, the author is in the wrong for doubting her without evidence and for trying to force her to test it. But they're not crossing the same line as the friends. The answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're not respecting her health choices and are being skeptical based on hearsay rather than facts.\n"
