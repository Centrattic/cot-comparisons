As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend with several food intolerances, and the author is doubting them. The author is skeptical because it's rare and has heard stories about parents misdiagnosing kids. They want her to try the foods again to see if she can tolerate them, but friends suggest sneaking it in, which the author thinks is crossing a trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions are wrong. The key points here are trust in the relationship, the approach taken, and the validity of the author's concerns. The author is concerned about the girlfriend's rare conditions and wants to test it, but the method\u2014like sneaking food\u2014is problematic. However, the author is trying to be cautious with trust, which is a good sign. They're not forcing it but are suggesting trying, and they're aware of the ethical line. The girlfriend's health is involved, so if she's truly intolerant, the author's push to test might be misguided. But the author isn't being malicious; they're skeptical but trying to support. The main issue is whether doubting the girlfriend's claims is wrong. But the author is not dismissing her symptoms but questioning the diagnosis, which is different. The answer likely hinges on respecting her experience and medical advice. Since the author is not acting in a harmful way and is trying to be cautious, maybe they're not in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), but I need to be careful. The fact that the author is trying to get her to test it through a doctor might be better than their friends' suggestions, so they're in the right not to cross the trust line. So the answer is B.\n"
