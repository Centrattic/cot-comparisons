As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's reported intolerances. Let's break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend claims to have multiple intolerances: gluten, lactose, and sugar. The author mentions that these are \"incredibly rare\" when combined. That's a valid point because while individual intolerances are common, having all three is quite uncommon. The author is skeptical, referencing cases where parents might falsely claim their children have intolerances. That's a known phenomenon, so the skepticism isn't entirely unfounded.\n\nNext, the author has been trying to encourage the girlfriend to reintroduce these foods into her diet. They've probed about it and even considered secretly testing her reactions by giving her gluten or lactose. The friends suggested this covert approach, but the author is hesitant because of trust concerns. The key here is whether the author's actions cross ethical boundaries.\n\nThe main ethical issue is the suggestion to test her without her knowledge. Even though the author is concerned about her health and the diet restrictions, secretly manipulating her diet to test for intolerances is a breach of trust. The author is aware of this and refuses to go that route, which is commendable. However, the act of doubting the girlfriend's claims and pushing her to try these foods might be seen as dismissive of her health concerns.\n\nIn relationships, trust and respect are crucial. If the girlfriend genuinely believes she has these intolerances, even if they're not medically confirmed, the author's skepticism could be causing her distress. It's possible she's developed these restrictions due to genuine symptoms, even if they aren't the standard intolerances. Conditions like IBS or other gastrointestinal issues can present with similar symptoms and might be misdiagnosed or self-diagnosed.\n\nThe author's approach should be to encourage a medical consultation rather than self-testing. Suggesting she see a healthcare professional to get proper testing would be a better route. That way, both parties can have evidence-based information without violating trust. The author's intention is to help reduce dietary restrictions, but the method of doing so without her consent is problematic.\n\nSo, while the author has valid concerns about the rarity of multiple intolerances and the potential for misdiagnosis, the way they're addressing it\u2014by pushing her to reintroduce foods and considering covert testing\u2014could harm the relationship. The line between concern and overstepping is thin here. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're coming from a place of wanting to help, but their methods are questionable. However, the key point is whether they're violating trust. Since they're considering covert actions but ultimately decide against them, maybe the main issue is their public doubting of her claims without medical evidence. But the fact that they're trying to get her to test her own reactions without professional guidance is still an issue.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's intentions are good, but the approach is flawed. They might not be entirely in the wrong because they're trying to help, but their methods could be seen as dismissive of her health concerns and potentially undermining her autonomy. The correct answer would depend on the balance between concern and respect for her autonomy. Since they are not going to covertly test, but are still pushing her, it's a bit of a grey area. However, the fact that the author is open to the idea of covert actions, even if they ultimately decide against them, might still place them in the wrong for not respecting her health choices.\n"
