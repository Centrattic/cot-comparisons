As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances. The setup is that she has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author finds rare. He's skeptical because he's heard of parents faking such issues in their kids. He's been trying to get her to eat those things again, even suggesting sneaking them into her food. Friends suggested that, but he thinks that's crossing a trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's break it down.\n\nThe main issues here are trust and health. The author is questioning the validity of her medical conditions. Even if there's a possibility she's not actually intolerant, he's acting on that doubt without her consent. Pushing her to eat things she believes she can't tolerate could cause physical harm if she actually is intolerant. Even if he's right, there's a risk of making her sick. That's a big deal.\n\nAlso, the author is considering sneaking gluten or lactose into her food to test her. That's a breach of trust because she's not aware of it. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and doing something without her knowledge could damage that. If she finds out, she might feel betrayed. Even if his intention is to help, the method is unethical.\n\nAnother angle is that the author is being skeptical, which isn't inherently wrong. But how he's handling it is problematic. Instead of discussing his concerns openly with her and perhaps suggesting a medical test (like seeing a doctor or doing an elimination diet under supervision), he's trying to force the issue. That's reckless.\n\nThe fact that she's been avoiding these things for a while now adds another layer. If she's been following a strict diet, reintroducing them without her consent could have negative health effects. Even if he's right, the approach is wrong because it's not consensual and could harm her.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is acting out of concern but in a way that violates trust and could harm her health. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
