As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that his girlfriend claims to have multiple intolerances\u2014gluten, lactose, and sugar. The author is skeptical because he's heard of cases where people are misdiagnosed or have their conditions influenced by others, like mothers he mentions. He's been trying to get her to test these again, but he's conflicted because his friends suggested sneaking gluten or lactose into her food to see if she actually reacts, which he thinks is crossing a trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the possible angles. On one hand, the author is concerned about his girlfriend's health and the rare combination of intolerances. He might be worried she's restricting her diet unnecessarily, which could lead to nutritional deficiencies or other issues. It's understandable to want to ensure she's not being overly restrictive, especially if the intolerances are recent developments. However, the key here is how he's approaching it. Probing her to try these foods again is one thing, but suggesting or even considering sneaking them into her food without her consent is another. Trust in a relationship is crucial, and undermining her health concerns without her knowledge could definitely be seen as a betrayal.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's health is her own, and if she's been diagnosed with these intolerances, even if they seem rare, she has the right to manage her diet as she sees fit. The author's skepticism might stem from a place of wanting to support her, but he's not in a position to question her health choices unless there's a medical reason to do so. Deliberately testing her reactions without her consent is a breach of trust and could cause emotional harm, even if his intentions are good.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author is aware of cases where people have been misdiagnosed is a valid point, but that doesn't give him the right to act on that suspicion without discussing it openly with her. The best approach would be to encourage her to consult a healthcare professional if she's unsure about her diagnoses. That way, both can address the issue without undermining her trust.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the right because he's planning to test her without consent, which is a serious breach of trust. Even if his intentions are to help, the method is wrong. Therefore, the answer should be A\u2014Yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
