As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The question is whether the person is wrong for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances. The user is asking if they're the a**hole for being skeptical.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which are rare. The author is skeptical because they've heard stories about people being misdiagnosed or even parents fabricating conditions. They're trying to get her to test these foods again, which she hasn't had since childhood. Some friends suggest sneaking it in, but the author is against that as it breaks trust.\n\nSo, what's the right approach here? Well, medical conditions like intolerances can develop at any age. Just because they're rare doesn't mean they aren't real. The author's skepticism might be based on anecdotes, but anecdotes aren't reliable evidence. The key here is trust in the relationship. The author is questioning their partner's health without professional input, which could be undermining her. Even if their intention is to help, pushing her to consume potentially harmful foods without her consent is problematic. The friends' suggestion to sneak it into her food is definitely crossing a trust boundary, which the author correctly identifies, but their own approach of urging her to try might still be causing doubt and stress. \n\nThe ethical aspect is about respecting her self-reported symptoms unless there's medical evidence to the contrary. The author hasn't consulted a healthcare professional, just relying on their own doubts. That's where the problem lies. Doubting someone's health issues without evidence can be hurtful and invalidating. So, the author is in the wrong because they're not supporting her and are instead trying to force her to challenge her own conditions without medical guidance. Hence, answer A.\n"
