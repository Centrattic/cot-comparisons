As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about doubting their girlfriend's reported food intolerances. The girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author thinks are rare. They mention skepticism and trying to get her to test these by eating them again. Friends suggested sneaking food with those ingredients, but the author is against that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. Do the intolerances exist? The author mentions it's rare to have multiple, but it's possible. People can develop intolerances later in life. However, there are cases of psychosomatic symptoms, so the author's doubt isn't entirely unfounded. But assuming the girlfriend is telling the truth, even if the author doubts it, that's a different issue.\n\nNext, the approach the author is taking. Probing and urging her to eat those foods again. That could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Even if the author is trying to help, pushing someone to consume something they believe they're intolerant to can be harmful. The friends' suggestion to sneak the food is a betrayal of trust, which the author correctly avoids. But the author's own actions of questioning and urging might still be problematic.\n\nTrust in a relationship is crucial. If the author keeps doubting her claims, even if well-intentioned, it can erode trust. The girlfriend might feel invalidated, which can hurt the relationship. The author should approach this with empathy, perhaps encouraging her to consult a healthcare professional instead of pressuring her to test it themselves.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong. The wrongness would relate to how they handle the situation. Even if their doubt is based on some truth, the way they express it and try to test it without her consent could be wrong. The author isn't forcing it, which is a good point, but the act of doubting and trying to get her to test it might still be inconsiderate.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they're not respecting her claims and her health decisions. The answer would be A (Yes) because the author is acting in a way that undermines the girlfriend's trust and well-being, even if their intentions are good.\n"
