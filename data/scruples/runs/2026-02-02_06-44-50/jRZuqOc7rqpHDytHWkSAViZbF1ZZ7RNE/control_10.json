As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person writing is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances. The situation is that the girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the writer finds rare. They're skeptical, thinking maybe it's not real, and have been trying to get her to test by eating those foods again. Some friends suggested sneaking it into her food, but the writer is hesitant because of trust issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider medical validity. Gluten intolerance can be a real thing, like Celiac disease, but there are also non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Lactose intolerance is common, though it can develop over time. Sugar intolerance is a bit vague but can exist. However, the writer is questioning the validity, which might be valid if the girlfriend isn't properly tested. But on the other hand, medical conditions can be real, and dismissing them can be harmful.\n\nThe writer is trying to get her to test by encouraging her to eat the foods again. That's one approach, but if she's genuinely ill, that could cause discomfort. Also, the friends suggesting sneaking food into her diet is a big no-no because it's a betrayal of trust. The writer is against that, which is good, but the act of questioning her conditions might be problematic. They should probably suggest proper medical testing instead of testing on their own. \n\nIs the writer in the wrong? They're not forcing her, just encouraging. But if the girlfriend's symptoms are real, the writer's doubt could be invalidating. However, if she's misdiagnosed, the writer is trying to help. But in relationships, respect for each other's health concerns is important. So maybe the writer is in the wrong because doubting without evidence isn't helpful. Or maybe not, if they're just being cautious.\n\nHmm. The key points are that the writer is skeptical, wants her to test, and friends suggest sneaking. The writer is against the sneaking, which is right. But doubting her without evidence could be wrong. If the girlfriend has proper medical confirmation, the writer should trust that. If not, maybe the writer is right to be cautious. But the writer's actions might be seen as not respecting her health concerns, which can be hurtful. So maybe AITA is a yes, the writer is in the wrong for doubting without proper evidence and pressuring her to test without her consent.\n"
