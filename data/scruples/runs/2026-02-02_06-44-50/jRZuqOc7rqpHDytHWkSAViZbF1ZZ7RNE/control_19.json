As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves him doubting his girlfriend's claimed intolerances to gluten, lactose, and sugar, which he considers rare. He's skeptical because he's heard of cases where people are misdiagnosed or parents mislead their children. He's trying to get her to test these foods again to see if she can tolerate them, but some friends suggest sneaking it in, which he's against.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical implications. Doubting a partner's health issues can be a sensitive matter. Even if the conditions are rare, it's possible that she genuinely has them, and his doubt might undermine her trust in him. On the other hand, he's concerned about her quality of life and the possibility of unnecessary restrictions. However, urging her to eat foods she claims to be intolerant to could lead to health issues if she's right. Also, suggesting friends to sneak the food is a betrayal of trust, which he correctly avoids.\n\nThe key points here are trust, respect, and the potential harm of his actions. Even if his intentions are good (wanting her to eat normally), pressuring her to consume foods she's avoiding could be harmful. It's important to validate her experiences and support her choices unless there's concrete evidence her claims are unfounded. Without medical confirmation, he shouldn't force her to test these things. Respecting her dietary restrictions, regardless of his skepticism, is crucial for maintaining trust in the relationship. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for doubting and pressuring her instead of seeking professional medical advice together.\n"
