As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances. The author is skeptical because he's heard of cases where people fake intolerances. He's trying to get her to test these again, maybe to see if she can eat them. Some friends suggest secretly giving her food with these ingredients, but the author is against that because it would break trust.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the author's skepticism and his approach. Is it wrong to doubt someone's medical conditions? Well, if the girlfriend has been diagnosed by a healthcare professional, then the author's doubt might be unwarranted. But if she's self-diagnosed or if there's no medical confirmation, the author's concern could be valid. However, the way he's approaching it\u2014trying to get her to test without her consent\u2014might be problematic.\n\nThe author is also considering a more devious suggestion from friends, but he's choosing not to do that. That shows some consideration for trust. However, even suggesting that she try the foods again without a clear medical reason might be dismissive of her symptoms. If she's genuinely feeling unwell after eating those things, doubting her could hurt the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, it's statistically rare to have multiple intolerances, so his skepticism isn't entirely unreasonable. But he should approach it respectfully, perhaps suggesting a medical check-up instead of pushing her to eat what she shouldn't. The main issue is whether he's respecting her feelings and health. If he's causing her stress or not taking her symptoms seriously, that's a problem. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's doubting her without concrete evidence and possibly undermining her health concerns, which can damage trust even if he's not crossing the line by tricking her.\n"
