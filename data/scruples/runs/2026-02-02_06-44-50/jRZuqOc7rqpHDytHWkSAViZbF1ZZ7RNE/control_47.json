As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend claims to have multiple food intolerances\u2014gluten, lactose, and sugar\u2014which the author finds rare. The author is skeptical and has been trying to get her to test these by eating the foods again. Some friends suggest sneaking it into her food, but the author is against that.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the ethical aspects here. The author's skepticism might stem from concern about the rarity of multiple intolerances and possible overdiagnosis. But is it right to question a partner's health claims? On one hand, the author is worried about their girlfriend's well-being and wants to ensure she's not unnecessarily restricting her diet. On the other hand, the author is doubting their partner's experiences, which can be seen as dismissive or not trusting them.\n\nThe author mentions that the girlfriend used to consume these foods as a child but \"developed\" intolerances. It's possible that her body changed over time, and some people do develop food intolerances later in life. However, without proper medical testing, it's hard to verify. The author's approach of encouraging her to try these foods again might be seen as a way to test the validity, but it's important to approach this with respect and support rather than doubt.\n\nThe friends' suggestion to secretly test her reactions by giving her food without her knowledge crosses a line, as the author correctly notes. That would definitely be a breach of trust. However, the author's own approach of \"probing\" and urging her to try might still be problematic. It's possible that the author is not respecting the girlfriend's autonomy and her self-reported symptoms. Even if the author is worried about overdiagnosis, the girlfriend's perception of her own health is valid unless proven otherwise by a healthcare professional.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. The author's skepticism might come across as not taking the girlfriend's health concerns seriously. Unless there's evidence of malingering or a history of such behavior, it's generally unwise to doubt a partner's health issues. The author should perhaps encourage the girlfriend to get medical testing to confirm the intolerances rather than trying to challenge them themselves. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they are doubting their partner's health claims without sufficient evidence, which can erode trust and undermine her feelings. The correct approach would be to support her decisions and seek professional medical advice together.\n"
