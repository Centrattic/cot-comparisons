As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's food intolerances. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author finds rare. He's skeptical, mentions hearing about parents fabricating such intolerances, and has been trying to get her to test these foods again. His friends even suggested secretly giving her these foods to see reactions, but he's against that.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The author is doubting his girlfriend's health claims. That could be problematic because questioning someone's health issues, especially when they're self-reported, can lead to mistrust. Even if he's concerned, his approach might be undermining her trust in him. \n\nNext, the methods he's using. Probing and urging her to try the foods again might be seen as invalidating her experiences. If she's genuinely feeling symptoms, forcing her to consume those foods could harm their relationship and her well-being. The friends' suggestion to test without her knowledge is definitely crossing a trust line, but the author is aware of that and hasn't gone that far. \n\nHowever, his skepticism isn't entirely unfounded. Some people do develop intolerances later in life, and there are cases where people might misdiagnose themselves. But the key here is how he's approaching it. Instead of discussing his concerns openly with his girlfriend, he's pushing her to test her intolerances, which could be seen as dismissive. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's trying to get her to reintroduce foods without her consent is a red flag. Even if his intentions are good (to expand her diet), the method is questionable. Trust in a relationship is crucial. If he's not respecting her choices regarding her health, that's a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, he's not acting on the more extreme advice of his friends. He's trying to balance his skepticism with maintaining trust, which is a good sign. But his actions still show a lack of trust in her self-awareness and health decisions.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's some validity in his skepticism (as some people might have undiagnosed conditions), the way he's handling it by doubting and pushing her to test without proper medical consultation is problematic. He should address this with her and possibly encourage her to get tested by a healthcare professional rather than making her try foods that could cause discomfort. Therefore, he is in the wrong for his approach, even if his intentions are to help.\n"
