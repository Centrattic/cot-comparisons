As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend has three specific intolerances: gluten, lactose, and sugar. The author mentions that this combination is rare. He's skeptical because he's heard of parents misdiagnosing their kids, so he's questioning her actual conditions. He's trying to encourage her to eat those foods again, thinking it might help her diet. Some friends suggested secretly testing her, but he thinks that's crossing a trust line.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's skepticism might stem from valid concerns about the rarity of multiple intolerances. However, the main issue is whether his actions are appropriate. He's not just doubting but actively trying to get her to consume the foods she claims to be intolerant to. Even though he's not going as far as his friends' suggestion to test without her knowledge, he's still pushing her to do things that could cause her discomfort if she's telling the truth.\n\nRespecting someone's health choices is crucial in a relationship. If she has a diagnosed intolerance, even if it's rare, it's a medical condition. The author is dismissing her experience, which can be hurtful. Trust and communication are important. Instead of doubting her, he should be supporting her, maybe suggesting she consult a healthcare professional to confirm the diagnoses. His approach risks undermining her trust in him if she's genuinely experiencing symptoms.\n\nAlso, the fact that she developed these intolerances later in life isn't necessarily unusual. Some people do develop food sensitivities as they age. The author's assumption that it's a deliberate misdiagnosis by her parents might be an overreach. Without evidence, it's not his place to question her health without proper consultation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not handling the situation well. He's not respecting her autonomy regarding her health and is acting on his own assumptions rather than seeking professional advice. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
