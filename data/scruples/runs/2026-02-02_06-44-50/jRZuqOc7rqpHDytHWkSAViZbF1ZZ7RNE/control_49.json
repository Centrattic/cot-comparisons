As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about doubting their girlfriend's reported intolerances to gluten, lactose, and sugar, which they find rare. The author has been skeptical, possibly influenced by stories of parents misdiagnosing their children. They've tried to encourage the girlfriend to reintroduce these foods, but some friends suggested more direct testing, which the author thinks is crossing a trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspects. The girlfriend claims to have multiple intolerances. The author is skeptical because they're rare. But just because something is rare doesn't mean it's not real. There could be valid medical reasons for developing intolerances later in life. For example, lactose intolerance can develop as people age. So the author's doubt might be unfounded without proper medical evidence.\n\nNext, the approach the author is taking. Probing and urging the girlfriend to try the foods again without her consent could be an issue. Even if their intention is to help her eat more freely, doing so without her agreement might undermine her trust. The author mentions friends suggesting a more invasive test, which they rightly think is crossing a line. So the author is trying to balance their concern with respecting her autonomy.\n\nThen, the ethical aspect. Trust in a relationship is crucial. If the author doesn't trust the girlfriend's self-reported symptoms without medical proof, that's a problem. They should probably encourage her to get tested by a healthcare professional instead of testing her themselves. Without that, they're not in a position to verify her conditions, and their actions could be seen as dismissive or intrusive.\n\nAlso, the author's skepticism might be influenced by anecdotes about parents misdiagnosing. However, each situation is different. Assuming the worst without evidence could be hurtful. The girlfriend might genuinely feel unwell when consuming these foods, so the author's doubts might cause her distress.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't the one making the medical claim, so they have a right to be cautious. But they need to approach it respectfully. The key issue is whether they're respecting her autonomy and medical choices. If they push her to eat the foods without her consent, that's a problem. However, suggesting a professional test would be appropriate.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's skepticism might be understandable given the rarity, but how they're handling it (urging her to try the foods and considering covert testing) is questionable. They should seek medical validation instead of pushing their own agenda. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A) because they're not respecting her medical autonomy and are acting on their own suspicions without proper support.\n"
