As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about doubting his girlfriend's reported intolerances to gluten, lactose, and sugar. He's skeptical because these are rare and has heard of cases where people are misdiagnosed. He's trying to get her to test these foods again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider medical aspects. Intolerances can develop over time, so even if she ate gluten as a child, she could have developed an intolerance later. Celiac disease, for example, can develop at any age. Lactose intolerance is more common with age as lactase production decreases. But the user is doubting her conditions, which might come from a place of concern but could also be a lack of trust in her health status.\n\nThen there's the aspect of trust in the relationship. He mentions he's trying to push her to eat these foods again, which she's avoiding. Some friends suggested sneaking it into her food, which he thinks is crossing a line. That's a red flag because it's deceptive and could harm trust. Even if his intentions are good, manipulating her diet without her consent is unethical and could damage the relationship.\n\nAnother angle is the psychological aspect. If she's been diagnosed by a healthcare professional, questioning that diagnosis without evidence can be dismissive of her health experience. Even if there's a possibility of misdiagnosis, the right approach would be to encourage her to consult a doctor for re-testing rather than trying to test it on her own. There's also the possibility that she's developed intolerances, and his skepticism might be invalidating her real symptoms.\n\nSo the key points are: 1) Trust in her health claims. 2) Ethical considerations of manipulating her diet. 3) Proper approach to medical concerns (consulting professionals). The friends' suggestion to give her food without consent is definitely wrong, and the author is right to avoid that. However, his overall approach of doubting her without talking to her about it or involving a medical professional might still be problematic. He should communicate openly with her about his concerns rather than pushing her to test the foods himself. So whether he's in the wrong depends on how he's approaching it. If he's being dismissive or not respecting her health choices, then yes. If he's concerned and wants to help but not intrusively, maybe not. But the main issue is the potential breach of trust and the method he's using. The answer likely is AITA: Yes, he's in the wrong for not trusting her health and suggesting deceptive methods, even if he didn't follow through.\n"
