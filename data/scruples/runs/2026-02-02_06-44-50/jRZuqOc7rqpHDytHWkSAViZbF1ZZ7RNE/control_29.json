As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that his girlfriend claims to have multiple intolerances\u2014gluten, lactose, and sugar. He's skeptical because he's heard of cases where people are misdiagnosed or even have parents exaggerate their conditions. He's tried to get her to test these intolerances again, maybe to see if they're still valid, but some friends suggested tricking her into eating the foods to test, which he's against.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. Gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances can develop over time. Just because someone had them as a child doesn't mean they can't develop as an adult. For example, lactose intolerance often starts in adulthood. So the author's skepticism might be based on a misunderstanding of how these conditions work.\n\nThen there's the interpersonal side. The author is questioning his girlfriend's health claims, which can be sensitive. Even if his intentions are good (he wants her to have a more varied diet), approaching it by doubting her could be seen as dismissive. Trust is important in a relationship, and if he's not careful, his doubts might come off as undermining her health concerns. The fact that he's talking to friends about testing without her knowledge could be a red flag. Even though he says he won't cross that line, the fact that he's considering it might make her feel unsafe or not trusted.\n\nThe friends' suggestion to trick her into eating the foods is definitely crossing a line. The author is right to reject that idea because it's a breach of trust. But his probing might still be causing issues. It's important to validate her feelings and health choices unless there's a clear reason to suspect malpractice, which in this case, there's no indication of that. The author's concern is based on rarity, but multiple intolerances can coexist. For example, someone with celiac disease (gluten) might also have lactose intolerance due to intestinal damage.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's publicly doubting her without evidence, that could be problematic. However, if he's seeking medical advice to verify, that's a different story. The key is how he approaches it. Instead of pushing her to test without proper medical guidance, he should support her in consulting a healthcare professional. If the doctor confirms the intolerances, then his doubt is unfounded. If not, then maybe there's another issue. But the way he's handling it\u2014probing and suggesting unverified tests\u2014could be seen as disrespectful. So, the answer might be A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not supporting her health decisions and is instead questioning without evidence, which can erode trust.\n"
