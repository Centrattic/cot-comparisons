As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances. The situation is that the girlfriend claims to have multiple intolerances\u2014gluten, lactose, and sugar\u2014which the author finds rare. They mention that some people might fake these for attention or due to parents influencing them. The author has been trying to get her to eat those foods again, suggesting she might have developed them, and friends even suggested sneaking it into her food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider medical aspects. Multiple intolerances are rare, but not impossible. People can develop new intolerances over time. However, the author is questioning the validity without proper evidence. Just because it's rare doesn't mean it's fake. The girlfriend might genuinely feel unwell after eating those foods.\n\nNext, the approach the author is taking. Encouraging her to try the foods again might be well-meaning, but doing so without her consent, especially if she's already made dietary changes, could be harmful. If she's experiencing symptoms, forcing her to eat them could cause discomfort. The friends suggesting sneaking it into her food is definitely crossing a trust line. The author is trying to balance concern with respecting her autonomy.\n\nTrust in a relationship is crucial. If the author is doubting her without evidence, that could lead to conflict. Even if they're right, the method of testing without consent is problematic. The author's skepticism might stem from a good place wanting to help, but it's important to respect her experience of her own body.\n\nAlso, the author should consider that medical conditions can be real even if they're not common. It's not their place to validate or invalidate her feelings without professional input. Consulting a healthcare provider would be a better approach than experimenting on their own.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's actions could be seen as dismissive of her health concerns and a breach of trust if they proceed without her agreement. They're not necessarily in the wrong for being skeptical, but their methods and lack of respect for her autonomy make them wrong. The answer is A.\n"
