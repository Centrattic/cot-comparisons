As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who doubts their girlfriend's intolerances is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend has several intolerances, which the author finds rare. They mention skepticism, possibly due to hearing stories about parents faking intolerance in their children.\n\nFirst, I need to consider medical validity. Gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances can occur at any age, though having all three is rare. The author is questioning the validity of these intolerances, which might stem from concern rather than malice. However, the approach they're taking\u2014encouraging the girlfriend to consume these foods without her consent\u2014is problematic. \n\nThe key point here is consent and trust. The user's friends suggested giving her food with these ingredients without her knowledge, which is a breach of trust. Even if the author's intention is to help her eat normally, it's not her place to test the validity without her agreement. The author is in a position of influence and should respect her health choices unless there's a medical reason to question them, which the author hasn't provided here.\n\nAdditionally, the author's skepticism might be based on anecdotal stories. While it's possible for people to develop intolerances later in life, dismissing her symptoms without evidence isn't helpful. It's important to approach health issues with empathy and support rather than doubt. The author should engage in a respectful dialogue instead of trying to force her to consume the foods.\n\nIn terms of ethics, even if the author's intentions are good, the method of probing without consent is wrong. Trust in a relationship is crucial, and the author is risking that by suggesting covert testing. The answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong because of the breach of trust and lack of consent, despite the underlying concern.\n"
