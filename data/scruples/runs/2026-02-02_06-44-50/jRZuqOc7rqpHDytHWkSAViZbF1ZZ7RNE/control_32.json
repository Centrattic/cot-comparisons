As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author doubting their girlfriend's reported intolerances to gluten, lactose, and sugar, which he considers rare. He's suggesting she try these foods again to see if the intolerances are real, but he's conflicted about secretly testing her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and relational aspects here. The girlfriend has stated her medical conditions, so the author is questioning their validity. There are two sides here: the author's concern about the rarity of multiple intolerances and the girlfriend's health and autonomy.\n\nOn one hand, the author is worried that the girlfriend might have been misdiagnosed, possibly due to misinformation or even parental influence, as he mentioned. His intention is to help her expand her diet, which is caring. But he's approaching it by pressuring her to try these foods again, which could be harmful if she genuinely has intolerances. Also, suggesting friends might secretly test her food crosses a trust line, which he's correctly avoiding.\n\nOn the other hand, questioning a partner's health issues can be seen as dismissive. Even if the author's skepticism is based on medical rarity, it's important to approach such topics with respect. The girlfriend might feel disrespected or not believed, which is a valid emotional concern. Trust and communication are key in relationships. Instead of doubting her, the author should support her in verifying the diagnoses through medical professionals, like getting a second opinion. Secretly testing her food without consent would definitely be a breach of trust, which he's recognizing.\n\nSo, the author's actions are problematic because he's doubting her health claims without proper evidence and pressuring her to consume foods she avoids. However, his intentions are to help. But the method is flawed. He's not in the wrong for having doubts, but he's wrong in how he's approaching her. The right approach would be to address his concerns through open communication and medical consultation, not by challenging her symptoms directly. Therefore, the answer leans towards AITA being A, he's in the wrong because he's undermining her health concerns and not respecting her autonomy. However, some might argue he's not in the wrong because his intentions are good. But generally, in these situations, supporting a partner's health choices and trusting their experience is crucial. So the answer is likely A.\n"
