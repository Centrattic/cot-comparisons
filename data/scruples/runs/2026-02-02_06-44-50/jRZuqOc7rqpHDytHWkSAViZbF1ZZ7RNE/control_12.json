As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances. The situation is that the girlfriend has multiple intolerances\u2014gluten, lactose, and sugar\u2014which the author finds rare. The author is skeptical and has heard stories about parents misdiagnosing their children. They've tried to get her to eat these foods again to test if she's actually intolerant. Friends suggested sneaking it in, but the author thinks that's crossing a trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's concern is valid because sometimes people might develop intolerances later or misdiagnose themselves. However, the girlfriend's health is a priority. Even if the author doubts the diagnosis, suggesting she reintroduce foods could be risky. If she's actually intolerant, it could cause her harm. The author's approach of directly challenging her through testing might not be the best way. The suggestion from friends to secretly test is definitely crossing a trust boundary, which the author rightly avoids. But still, the author's public doubt and attempts to make her eat those foods without her consent could be seen as dismissive of her health concerns. Trust and respect are important in a relationship. The author might be trying to help, but the method might be inconsiderate. So, is the author in the wrong? Maybe. They should approach this respectfully, perhaps suggesting a medical consultation instead of pushing her to eat the foods. So the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're not respecting her health concerns and their methods could be harmful.\n"
