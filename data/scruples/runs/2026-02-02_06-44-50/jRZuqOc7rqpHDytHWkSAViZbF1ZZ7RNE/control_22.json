As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person's girlfriend claims to have multiple intolerances\u2014gluten, lactose, and sugar. The author is skeptical because they're rare and has heard about cases where parents might have influenced their kids' beliefs. The author is trying to encourage the girlfriend to reintroduce these foods into her diet, maybe to test the validity of the intolerances. They're considering sneaking food with gluten or lactose to see her reaction, but they're hesitant because they don't want to cross a trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's intention is to help the girlfriend by possibly correcting a mistaken belief, but they're approaching it by questioning her health claims. However, health issues are personal and sensitive. Even if the author's friends suggest sneaking food, the author is against that, which shows they have some awareness of trust issues. But the act of doubting the girlfriend's reported symptoms could be seen as not respecting her experiences. \n\nNext, medical validation. The girlfriend claims to have developed these intolerances. It's possible she has legitimate conditions, even if rare. If she's been diagnosed by a healthcare professional, then the author's doubt is unwarranted. But if the diagnosis is self-diagnosed or not verified, there's room for skepticism. However, the author's approach of urging her to try the foods again could be counterproductive. Forcing someone to consume something they believe they're intolerant to might cause anxiety or physical symptoms due to the nocebo effect.\n\nTrust in a relationship is crucial. The author's skepticism could be seen as undermining the girlfriend's health concerns, which might make her feel invalidated. The suggestion to secretly test her reaction crosses a trust line, but the author is already questioning her claims, which is a form of doubt. Even without sneaking food, the probing questions might be making her feel like her partner doesn't believe her. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern for the girlfriend's quality of life is understandable. Restrictive diets can be hard, and if the intolerances are unfounded, helping her reintroduce these foods could be beneficial. But the method of approaching this is important. Encouraging her to seek a professional medical evaluation instead of pressuring her to eat the foods might be a better approach. \n\nSo, the key points are: doubting her health claims could harm trust, suggesting unorthodox testing methods is problematic, but the intent to help is there. The author's actions might be seen as dismissive of her health concerns, which could be hurtful. Therefore, they might be in the wrong for not respecting her experience and potentially undermining her trust. However, if the girlfriend's claims are indeed unfounded, the author's concern is valid. But the way they're handling it is likely inappropriate.\n"
