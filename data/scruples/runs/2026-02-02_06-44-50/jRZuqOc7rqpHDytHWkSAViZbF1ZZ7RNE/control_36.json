As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's food intolerances. The situation is that the girlfriend claims to have gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author finds rare. They've tried to get her to test these by eating the foods again, but some friends suggest sneaking it in, which the author is against.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is expressing skepticism about their partner's medical conditions. While it's true that some people might develop intolerances later in life, it's also possible that the girlfriend genuinely has these issues. The author's approach of encouraging her to try the foods again is one thing, but the friends' suggestion to secretly test her reactions crosses into manipulation. The author is against that, which is a good sign, showing they respect her autonomy.\n\nHowever, the author's public doubt and pushing her to test could be seen as undermining her experience. Trust in a relationship is important. If the girlfriend feels her partner doesn't believe her, that could cause issues. On the other hand, the author's concern about restrictive diets and wanting her to enjoy food is reasonable. But how they approach it matters.\n\nThe key points are: Is the author's skepticism valid? Well, it's okay to have doubts, but respecting her self-reported experiences is crucial. The author isn't forcing her, just suggesting trying again, which isn't inherently wrong. But the line is crossed if it leads to distrust. Since the author is not going the manipulative route and is open to her responses, maybe they aren't wrong. However, they should approach the topic with more empathy and understanding, perhaps by supporting her in getting medical confirmation if needed. So, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but they need to handle it sensitively.\n"
