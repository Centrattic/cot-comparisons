As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author doubting his girlfriend's supposed intolerances to gluten, lactose, and sugar, which he finds incredibly rare. He's skeptical because he's heard stories of parents misdiagnosing their kids. He's trying to get her to try those foods again, thinking it would help her diet, but some friends suggested sneaking it to her, which he feels is crossing a trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the author's actions. Doubting a partner's health issues can be problematic. Even if he's skeptical, it's important to respect her experiences. Medical conditions like intolerances aren't something people typically make up, and his approach might come off as dismissive. Probing and suggesting she try the foods again could be seen as undermining her health concerns. While his intention might be to help, the way he's approaching it could be hurtful. The fact that some friends suggested sneaking food into her diet is a red flag, as that's definitely a breach of trust. The author is against that, which is good, but his own actions of questioning and pushing her to test might still be invalidating.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about her diet restrictions. But the key here is how he's handling it. Instead of doubting, he should communicate openly, perhaps encourage her to get tested by a healthcare professional if there's genuine concern. Medical diagnoses can change over time, but that's a matter for professionals, not a partner trying to test it themselves. The author's skepticism could erode trust and make her feel unsupported. So, while he's trying to be helpful, his approach is flawed. The right answer here is that he's in the wrong because he's not respecting her health concerns and is acting in a way that's potentially dismissive and could harm their relationship.\n"
