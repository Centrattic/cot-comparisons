As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about doubting their girlfriend's food intolerances. The key points are that the GF has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerance, which the author considers rare. The author is skeptical, mentions stories where parents might misdiagnose their kids, and has tried to get her to eat these foods again. Friends suggested sneaking food with those ingredients, but the author is hesitant to cross that trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if doubting a partner's health issues is wrong. Medical conditions can be real, even if they're rare. The girlfriend might have legitimate reasons for her intolerances, maybe even diagnosed by a doctor. The author's approach of suggesting she try the foods again could be seen as dismissive of her health. Even if the author is concerned about the diet's restrictiveness, pushing her to eat things she's avoiding could be harmful.\n\nThe author's friends suggesting sneaking food is crossing a trust line, which the author correctly recognizes. However, the initial probing and urging to try the foods might still be problematic. It's important to respect someone's health decisions unless there's clear evidence they're incorrect. The author's doubt might stem from a place of wanting to help, but without medical evidence, it's not valid to second-guess a partner's health issues. So, the author is possibly in the wrong here because they're not respecting her condition and might be undermining her trust.\n"
