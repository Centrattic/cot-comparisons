As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted this is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances. The author mentions that their girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which they find rare. They\u2019ve been skeptical, comparing it to cases where parents falsely claim their children have intolerances. The author has tried to get her to reintroduce these foods, even considering sneaking them into her food, but some friends suggested that, and they think that crosses a trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the validity of the girlfriend's claims. Intolerances can be real, but they can also be misdiagnosed or self-diagnosed. It's possible that the girlfriend actually has these issues, especially if she's experiencing symptoms. But the author is concerned about the rarity and the fact that she had these foods as a child, implying that intolerances might have developed later, which is possible for some people, like with lactose intolerance sometimes developing after a gastrointestinal infection.\n\nHowever, the author's approach is causing tension. The main issue here is the author questioning the validity of the girlfriend's conditions and trying to challenge them. Even if the author is motivated by wanting to help reduce dietary restrictions, the method of suggesting or attempting to test these intolerances without her consent could undermine trust. The author is in a position where they need to respect their partner's health concerns unless there's clear evidence to the contrary. If the girlfriend has been diagnosed by a healthcare professional, then doubting that diagnosis without evidence could be seen as dismissive. On the other hand, if the girlfriend hasn't been properly tested, the author might have a valid concern, but the approach is questionable.\n\nThe key here is the balance between concern and respect. The author's probing might be coming from a place of wanting to help, but it's important to validate the partner's experiences. If the girlfriend is experiencing symptoms, forcing her to consume the foods could be harmful and show a lack of trust in her well-being. The fact that the author is considering sneaking the foods into her diet is a red flag because it violates trust. Even though they think that's crossing a line, suggesting she try them without her consent is also problematic. The author should be supporting her in managing her diet as she sees fit unless there's medical evidence to the contrary.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, the act of doubting and attempting to test without consent is likely the issue. Even if the author's intentions are good, the approach is disrespectful. The correct approach would be to encourage her to consult a healthcare provider for testing rather than conducting their own experiments. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they are questioning their partner's health issues in a way that undermines her experience and trust.\n"
