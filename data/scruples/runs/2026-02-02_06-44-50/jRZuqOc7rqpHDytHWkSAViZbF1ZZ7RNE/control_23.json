As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author finds rare. He's been skeptical, mentioning stories of parents misdiagnosing their kids. He's been trying to get her to eat gluten or lactose again, thinking she might have developed these issues later. His friends suggested secretly testing her, but he's hesitant to cross that trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if his skepticism is justified. It's true that some people develop intolerances as they age, so it's not impossible. However, there's a difference between being skeptical and being dismissive. If the girlfriend is experiencing symptoms that align with these intolerances, then maybe there's validity to her claims. On the other hand, if the author is pushing her to eat things she avoids, that could be harmful or disrespectful.\n\nThe author's main motivation is wanting her to have a less restricted diet. But he's questioning her health claims instead of supporting her. Even if he's right, the method of encouraging her to try these foods without addressing her health concerns might be inconsiderate. Also, his friends' idea of sneaking in the ingredients would definitely be a betrayal of trust, which he rightly avoids, but his current approach of pressuring her might still be problematic.\n\nAnother angle: if she truly has these intolerances, forcing her to eat them could cause physical discomfort. Even if he's wrong and she doesn't have them, he's not accounting for her well-being. If she's wrong, she might end up in pain, which isn't fair. So, maybe the right approach would be to support her in getting a medical test or consultation instead of doubting her.\n\nIn relationships, trust and support are key. If the author isn't respecting her health choices and is pressuring her, that could be seen as wrong. Unless there's a valid reason to question her, but given that she has these issues now, it's her body. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because he's undermining her health decisions without proper evidence or support.\n"
