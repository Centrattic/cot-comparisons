As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who has multiple intolerances\u2014gluten, lactose, sugar. The author is skeptical because he says these are rare and has heard stories where parents falsely claim their kids have intolerances. He's been trying to get her to test them again, maybe to see if she can eat them now. Some friends suggested tricking her by giving her food with those items, but he thinks that crosses a line.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's skepticism might be based on legitimate concerns about the rarity of multiple intolerances. But how does one handle this without violating trust? The author is expressing doubt but not in a harmful way. He's suggesting she try the foods again, which is a reasonable approach if done with her consent. However, the friends' idea of secretly testing her reactions is definitely crossing a trust line. The author is against that, which is good.\n\nAnother angle: medical validity. Some people do develop intolerances later in life, and others might misdiagnose themselves. But without a medical professional's diagnosis, it's hard to say. However, the author isn't trying to force her to eat them; he's just encouraging her to test them. But pushing for her to consume something she believes she's intolerant to could lead to anxiety or health issues if she actually is allergic or intolerant. Wait, the question is about intolerances, not allergies. Allergies are more severe, but intolerances can still cause discomfort. If she has a legitimate intolerance, eating those foods could make her feel unwell. The author's skepticism might be valid if she's misdiagnosing herself, but it's important to approach this with care and respect for her feelings and health.\n\nTrust is a big factor here. If the author is doubting her without her knowledge, that could strain the relationship. But he's been open about his doubts? Wait, the user says \"I\u2019ve been skeptical\" and \"trying to urge her to try again.\" So he's discussing this with her, perhaps? The key point is whether he's being respectful. If he's suggesting testing in a consensual way, that's one thing. But if he's pressuring her or not respecting her decisions, that's another.\n\nThe answer depends on whether the author is in the wrong for doubting. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) dynamic here is about whether his skepticism is valid or if he's being dismissive. Medical conditions can be tricky, and without evidence, his doubt might be seen as dismissive. However, if he's approaching it with the intent to help her, maybe not. The fact that he's considering her well-being by wanting her to eat without restrictions is a point in his favor. But if his doubts are leading to actions that could harm her trust or health, that's a problem.\n\nThe friends' suggestion to secretly test her is definitely wrong, but the author is against that. So he's not doing that. The main issue is his doubt. If he's respectful and supports her decision, even if he has doubts, he's not in the wrong. But if he's actively trying to undermine her trust by pushing her to eat things she thinks she can't, that's where the line is. However, the user mentions he's been \"probing it more\" and \"urging her to try again.\" That might be seen as pressuring her, which could be disrespectful if she's genuinely trying to manage her health.\n\nIn conclusion, if the author is respectfully encouraging her to test her intolerances with her consent, he's not in the wrong. But if he's being dismissive of her health concerns without proof, he could be. The key here is that he's not acting recklessly, just expressing skepticism. Since he's not forcing her to do anything and is aware of the trust issues, the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong). But some might argue that doubting her health issues without evidence is being an asshole. However, given the context of wanting her to eat without restrictions and not acting deceptively, maybe B is the correct choice.\n"
