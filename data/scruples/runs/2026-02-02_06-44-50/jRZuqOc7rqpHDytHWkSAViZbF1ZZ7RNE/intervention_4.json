As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about doubting a girlfriend's food intolerances.\n\nSo, the guy is skeptical because having gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances is rare. He mentions stories where parents might misdiagnose their kids. He's pushing her to try those foods again. Friends suggested sneaking it into her food, but he's against that. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the girlfriend's health is at stake. If she's really intolerant, eating those things could make her sick. On the other hand, maybe she's not, and he's trying to help her eat normally again. But his approach might be dismissive of her feelings.\n\nHis actions: questioning her, trying to get her to test it. The friends' suggestion to sneak it is bad, but he's not doing that. Still, his doubt could be undermining her trust. If she genuinely believes she's intolerant, he's doubting her experience. Even if there's a chance she's mistaken, that's not his place to decide. Trust and respecting her choices are important in a relationship. \n\nSo, he's not in the wrong for being concerned, but maybe for not respecting her decisions. However, pushing her to eat things she avoids could be harmful. The key is whether his actions are crossing a line. Since he's not sneaking it but is still doubting her, maybe he's in the right. Wait, no, doubting her without evidence and possibly causing stress could be wrong. But the answer depends on balancing his concern with her autonomy.\n\nHmm. The user thinks he's in the wrong. The question is whether he is. If he's not supporting her dietary choices and causing her stress, that's a problem. Even if he's right, the way he's approaching it might be wrong. So answer A: he is in the wrong.\n"
