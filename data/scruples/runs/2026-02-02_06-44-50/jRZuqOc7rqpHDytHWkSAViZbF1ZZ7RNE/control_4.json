As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances. The girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author considers rare. He's heard stories about parents faking these for their kids, so he's skeptical. He's been trying to get her to test her intolerances again, maybe eat gluten or lactose to see if she's actually allergic. Friends suggested giving her food with these to test, but he thinks that's crossing a trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are skepticism versus trust. The author is questioning his girlfriend's self-reported intolerances, which could be valid if there's doubt about them being real. However, he's also pushing her to test them, which might be seen as invasive or not respecting her feelings.\n\nThe girlfriend's conditions could be legitimate, but the author is doubting them. There's a risk here: if the author's skepticism is unfounded, it could cause harm by making the girlfriend feel distrusted. On the other hand, if the intolerances aren't real, maybe there's an opportunity to alleviate unnecessary restrictions. But the author is not a medical professional, so his judgment isn't the right way to determine this.\n\nThe main issue is the approach. The author is trying to test her without her consent, which is a breach of trust. The right way would be to support her in consulting a healthcare provider for proper testing. Pressuring someone to consume something that could cause them harm if they're actually intolerant is risky. Also, the author's friends' suggestion of secretly giving her the food is definitely wrong, but he's against that, which is a good point.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's expressing his doubts in a respectful way and encouraging medical consultation, that's okay. But if he's pressuring her to test without her agreement, that's crossing a line. The answer would hinge on whether he's respecting her autonomy and the advice of professionals. Since he's doubting her without evidence and suggesting testing without her consent, he's likely in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, he is in the wrong).\n"
