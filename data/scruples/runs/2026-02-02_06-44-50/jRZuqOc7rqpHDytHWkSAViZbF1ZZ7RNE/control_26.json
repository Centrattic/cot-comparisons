As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which he considers rare. He's skeptical because he's heard about cases where people aren't actually intolerant but claim to be. He's tried to encourage her to test these foods again, which she used to eat as a child. Some friends suggested secretly giving her the foods to see her reaction, but the author thinks that crosses a trust line. He's now questioning if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: his skepticism, his attempts to get her to test her intolerances, the suggestion of a more invasive test by friends, and whether his actions are respectful or not.\n\nI need to assess if doubting her conditions is valid. Medical conditions like celiac disease or lactose intolerance can develop later in life, so it's not impossible for her to have them. The fact that they co-occur might seem rare, but it's not unheard of. However, the author is questioning her without evidence, which could be problematic. \n\nSupporting someone's health choices is important in a relationship. If he's not believing her symptoms, that could be seen as dismissive. Even if he's concerned about the possibility of them being unfounded, he should approach the situation with respect. Pressuring her to eat the foods could cause her discomfort and harm trust. \n\nThe friends' suggestion to secretly test her is definitely crossing a line, but the author is against that. However, his own probing might still be problematic. Doubting her without concrete evidence and pushing her to test could be seen as undermining her health concerns. \n\nOn the other hand, he's concerned about her dietary restrictions and wants her to be able to eat normally, which is a valid concern. But how he's handling it might be the issue. He should perhaps encourage her to get tested by a healthcare professional instead of doubting her or pressuring her to eat questionable foods. \n\nIn terms of trust, if he's being open about his doubts and discussing them with her, maybe there's a way to find a middle ground. But if he's being dismissive or causing her to feel doubted, that's where he might be wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in a tricky spot. His intentions might be good, but his approach could be harmful. Doubting her without evidence and suggesting she test her intolerances in a way that causes stress might be inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer might be that he's in the wrong (A), but I need to be sure.\n\nWait, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's acting out of concern but in a way that's not supportive, maybe it's a matter of perspective. However, supporting someone's health conditions is a relationship expectation, so doubting them could be considered wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
