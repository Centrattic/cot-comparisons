As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's food intolerances. The girlfriend claims to have gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author thinks is rare. The author mentions having heard stories where parents might have misdiagnosed their children, and now he's trying to get her to test these foods again. His friends even suggest sneaking them into her food, but he's against that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is being skeptical of his girlfriend's health claims. While it's true that some people might have psychosomatic symptoms or self-diagnose without proper medical backing, the author's approach could be problematic. Doubting someone's health issues can lead to a lack of support and trust. Even if there's a possibility that her intolerances aren't real, the author isn't in a position to validate or invalidate them without professional help.\n\nThe key points are the author's skepticism and his approach. Probing and urging her to consume foods he knows she's supposed to avoid is pushing her to take risks. Even if his intention is to help her potentially reintroduce these foods, doing so without her consent or medical supervision is crossing a line. The fact that he's considered sneaking it into her food (which he rightly thinks is a trust issue) shows he's aware of the ethical problem here.\n\nOn the other hand, his concern is genuine\u2014he wants to help her expand her diet. However, the method is questionable. The right approach would be to encourage her to see a healthcare professional for proper testing rather than doubting her symptoms and pressuring her to experiment. Trust is important in a relationship, and undermining her health concerns can damage that trust.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Yes, because he's dismissing her experiences and trying to force her to test her intolerances without her consent or medical guidance. Even if his intentions are good, the action is harmful and disrespectful. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
