As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted the question is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's food intolerances. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the poster finds rare. He's skeptical and has heard stories about people being misdiagnosed, maybe even by parents. He's trying to get her to reintroduce these foods, but he's conflicted about whether to test her reactions without her consent, which he thinks would cross a trust line.\n\nSo, the main issue here is doubting her medical conditions. The posters are in a relationship, and trust is important. If the girlfriend has been diagnosed by a healthcare professional, then the author's doubt might be unwarranted. Even if the conditions are rare, that doesn't mean they're not real. It's possible she has a legitimate condition, or maybe she's been misdiagnosed, but the poster shouldn't assume that. \n\nAlso, the suggestion to test her by giving her gluten or lactose without her knowledge crosses a line. That's a breach of trust and could be harmful if she actually has an intolerance. Even if she doesn't, doing that without her consent is a violation. The poster is conflicted about this, which shows he's aware of the potential issue, but still has some doubt.\n\nThe friends' suggestion to test her is problematic, but the poster is right to avoid that. However, his skepticism itself might be causing tension. He should probably communicate his concerns in a supportive way, maybe encouraging her to consult a doctor for a re-evaluation if she's unsure. Pushing her to reintroduce these foods without her agreement isn't the right approach. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if he's questioning her legitimate medical conditions, that could be seen as dismissive. However, his intentions are to help her eat more normally. But the key is trusting her experience. Unless there's evidence of malingering, it's not his place to second-guess her health. So, he's in the wrong for doubting her without supporting evidence and for considering a test without her consent.\n"
