As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances. The girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which are mentioned as rare when combined. The author is skeptical, referencing stories about parents misdiagnosing kids. They've tried to get her to reintroduce these foods, and friends suggested sneaking them into her food, which the author refuses to do.\n\nFirst, I need to consider medical validity. The author is right that having multiple intolerances is rare, but not impossible. People can develop intolerances later in life. The author's skepticism might be based on real concerns about over-diagnosis, but it's important to respect the girlfriend's health. However, pushing her to eat foods she avoids could be harmful if she genuinely has issues. The friends' idea to sneak gluten or lactose is a bad line to cross, even if the author isn't doing that.\n\nThe key points are: the author's concern is valid but expressed in a way that's dismissive of the girlfriend's health. Encouraging her to eat foods she's avoiding could cause physical discomfort. The author's intention is to help, but the approach might be undermining trust. The girlfriend's trust is important, and the author is trying to avoid crossing that line, which is good. However, doubting her condition without evidence could be seen as dismissive. If the author isn't causing her harm by forcing her to eat those foods, but is still doubting her, that's a problem. The answer might hinge on whether the doubt is respectful or if it's causing her distress. Since the author is trying to encourage her to try the foods (which could be harmful if she's truly intolerant) but isn't sneaking them, it's a mix. However, the fact that they are doubting her condition and attempting to get her to reintroduce potentially problematic foods could be seen as inconsiderate. So, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong because they are dismissing her health issues and attempting to challenge them without her consent.\n"
