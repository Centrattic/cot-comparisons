As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend with multiple intolerances\u2014gluten, lactose, and sugar. The author is skeptical because he thinks it's rare and has heard stories about people being misdiagnosed, maybe even by parents. He's been trying to get her to test her intolerances again, suggesting she eat gluten or milk to see if she can handle it now. Friends suggested sneaking it into her food, but he's against that.\n\nSo, the main points here. The author is doubting his girlfriend's medical conditions. Is that wrong? Well, medical issues can be personal. Even if the conditions are rare, it's not his place to question her without evidence. He's heard anecdotal stories, but that doesn't mean every case is faked. Maybe she's been properly diagnosed by a doctor. If he's concerned, the right approach would be to support her in getting a second opinion rather than trying to test her himself. Also, pressuring her to eat things she avoids could be harmful if she actually is intolerant. The fact that he's considering sneaking food into her meals is a trust issue. Even if he's well-meaning, doubting her without medical reasons can be seen as dismissive. Relationships require trust, and questioning her health without cause might be crossing a line. So, I think the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
