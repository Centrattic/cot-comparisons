As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. The situation is about their girlfriend having multiple intolerances: gluten, lactose, and sugar. The author is doubting these because they're rare, and they've heard stories where parents might have misdiagnosed their kids. They've been trying to get her to eat these foods again to test if they actually cause issues. Some friends suggested sneaking food into her meals to see her reaction, but the author thinks that's crossing a trust line.\n\nFirst, I should consider the medical aspect. Intolerances can develop over time for various reasons, like stress, other health issues, or even changes in gut microbiota. Just because it's rare doesn't mean it's impossible. The author's skepticism might come from a place of wanting to help, but questioning someone's health condition can be hurtful.\n\nThen there's the approach. The author is encouraging her to reintroduce these foods, which could be a valid step if done properly, like under a healthcare provider's guidance. However, pushing someone to eat something they believe they can't tolerate without their consent or without proper testing might not be the best approach. Sneaking food into her meals, as the friends suggested, is definitely a breach of trust and unethical, even if the author doesn't go that far themselves.\n\nTrust is a big part of relationships. If the author is doubting her health without evidence, that can damage trust. But if there's a legitimate reason to question the diagnosis, maybe consulting a professional would be the right step. The author's intention is to help by reducing dietary restrictions, which is understandable, but the method might be problematic. They should probably talk to a doctor or a dietitian to verify the intolerances instead of testing it themselves. Pushing her to eat them without her agreement could lead to negative reactions, both physically and emotionally. So the author is in a tricky spot between wanting to support her and being skeptical. The key here is whether their actions respect her autonomy and medical choices. Since they're not forcing it but are suggesting it, maybe they're not in the wrong, but they should be cautious about how to approach it properly.\n"
