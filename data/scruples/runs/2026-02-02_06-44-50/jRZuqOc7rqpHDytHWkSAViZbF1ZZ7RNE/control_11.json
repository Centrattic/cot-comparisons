As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances. The girlfriend claims to have gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerance, which the author finds rare. The author is skeptical and wants her to test these by eating them again. The friends suggest sneaking it in, but the author thinks that's crossing a trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspect here. Doubting someone's health conditions can be sensitive. Even if the author has valid reasons for skepticism, the approach matters. Intentionally causing someone to consume something they believe they're allergic to without consent could be harmful. It could lead to trust issues in the relationship. The author is trying to encourage her to test it, but without coercion. However, the friends' suggestion to secretly test it is indeed crossing a line. The author is aware of that and is against it, which is good.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for being skeptical? Well, skepticism isn't inherently wrong, but how it's expressed is important. The author is trying to encourage her to verify the intolerances, which might be helpful if done respectfully. However, questioning someone's health without supporting them could be seen as dismissive. The key is whether the author is being supportive while encouraging verification. If the author is doing it in a way that's undermining her concerns, that's problematic. But if they're approaching it with care and respect, maybe not.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the girlfriend used to eat those foods as a child, so maybe she developed the intolerances later. That's possible, but the author's skepticism is based on rarity. However, individual health can vary, and self-diagnosed intolerances can sometimes be real. The author's approach is to suggest trying again, which is reasonable if done with her consent. The friends' idea to sneak it in is definitely wrong, but the author isn't doing that.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for being skeptical and wanting to test it. The answer depends on whether the author is being supportive. If the author is respectful and not pressuring her, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if the skepticism is causing her distress, that's a problem. The question is whether the author's actions are wrong. Since the author is trying to encourage testing without crossing trust lines, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, it's possible that the author should trust her claims unless there's clear evidence to the contrary. But without knowing if the girlfriend actually is intolerant, the author's concern is valid. The answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong, as they are trying to be supportive and avoid crossing trust lines.\n"
