As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I The Asshole) post is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's food intolerances.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend claims to have gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author thinks is rare. The author is skeptical, having heard of cases where people were told they had intolerances that weren't real. They've tried to push her to test these by reintroducing the foods, but the author is conflicted about secretly testing her reactions because that would cross a trust line.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. To evaluate this, I need to consider a few factors. Medical conditions like food intolerances can be real, even if they develop later in life. The author's skepticism might be valid if there's a lack of medical evidence, but questioning someone's health issues can come off as dismissive. \n\nThe author's approach of suggesting she try the foods again could be seen as supporting her in managing her diet, but pressuring someone to test their own symptoms without their consent is problematic. The friends' suggestion to secretly test her reactions definitely crosses ethical boundaries. The author is aware of this and is hesitating, which shows they recognize the importance of trust and consent.\n\nIt's important to note that medical conditions aren't always black and white. Even if the author has doubts, the right approach is to support the person in seeking professional medical advice rather than questioning their symptoms directly. Dismissing someone's health concerns can lead to feelings of invalidation and strain the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about their partner's quality of life due to dietary restrictions. However, the method of addressing this concern\u2014by doubting the validity of the conditions\u2014might not be the healthiest approach. The correct step would be to encourage evidence-based solutions, perhaps by suggesting she consult a healthcare provider for proper testing rather than self-experimentation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might stem from a place of wanting to help, their actions and doubts could be seen as undermining their partner's health concerns. The key issue here is respecting her experience and medical advice. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for doubting her without evidence and for considering deceptive testing methods.\n"
