As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's reported food intolerances.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend claims to have multiple intolerances: gluten, lactose, and sugar. The author is skeptical because he's heard about cases where people, sometimes parents, fabricate these issues for their children. He's trying to get her to test these intolerances again, maybe to see if they still exist. Some friends suggest tricking her by giving her the foods without her knowledge, but he's against that as it might break trust.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's wrong. Let's break down the factors. Food intolerances are real, but some people might develop them later in life. It's not uncommon for someone to outgrow an intolerance, but that's not always the case. The author's skepticism might be based on legitimate concerns, especially if he's heard of cases where people faked intolerances. However, his approach is to push her to try the foods again. \n\nBut here's the thing: even if the author is skeptical, he's not in a position to test her claims without her consent. Suggesting she try the foods again could be seen as dismissive of her health concerns. If she genuinely has these intolerances, forcing her to consume them could cause her discomfort or health issues. The friends' idea of secretly testing her reaction is definitely crossing a line, but the author isn't doing that. He's just urging her to try again, which could still be problematic.\n\nAnother angle: trust in a relationship. If the girlfriend has told him she has these issues, and he's doubting her without clear evidence, that could undermine trust. Even if he's concerned about her being overly restrictive, he should approach it with support rather than skepticism. Maybe suggesting they consult a healthcare professional would be a better approach. That way, they can get objective information without putting her health at risk.\n\nAlso, the fact that she developed these intolerances as an adult is not unheard of. Some people do develop new intolerances later. The author's assumption that this is rare might be incorrect. Even if it's rare for someone to have all three, it's not impossible. His skepticism could come off as not taking her health seriously.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author's actions (urging her to test) might be seen as inconsiderate if they cause her harm. However, his intentions are to help her eat more freely. But the method is questionable. The key here is whether he's respecting her autonomy and health concerns. If she's experiencing symptoms, he should respect that even if he's unsure.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's doubt might be based on valid concerns, but his approach could be harmful. He's not the one in the wrong for having doubts, but the way he's handling it could be problematic. However, he's not crossing the line into deception like his friends suggested. The answer might be that he's not in the wrong (B) because he's trying to find a solution but could have handled it better. Alternatively, if the doubting without evidence is seen as dismissive, then A. But generally, it's more about how he's approaching it. Since he's not tricking her, but just suggesting testing, maybe he's not in the wrong. So the answer might be B.\n"
