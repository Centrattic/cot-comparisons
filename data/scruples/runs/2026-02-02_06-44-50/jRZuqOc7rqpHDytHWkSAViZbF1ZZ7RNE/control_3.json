As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's food intolerances. The situation is that the girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author finds rare. The author is skeptical, mentions a phenomenon where some parents might falsely claim their children have intolerances, and has been trying to get her to test these by consuming them again. Friends suggested a more covert approach, but the author is hesitant about that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the validity of the girlfriend's claims. If she has medical evidence, like a doctor's diagnosis, then the author's doubt might be unwarranted. However, if there's no such evidence, the author's skepticism could be justified. But even if that's the case, the way the author is approaching it matters. Pressuring someone to consume something they avoid due to health reasons can be seen as dismissive of their needs, even if the author is concerned.\n\nThe author's friends suggested a more sneaky method, which the author rightly thinks is crossing a trust line. That's a good point because trust is crucial in relationships. However, the author is still questioning the validity of the intolerances, which might be undermining the girlfriend's health concerns. It's important to respect a partner's health choices unless there's clear evidence they are unfounded. Even then, approaching the situation with empathy and seeking medical advice together would be better than pressuring her to eat things she's avoiding.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, if the girlfriend's intolerances are real and diagnosed, then doubting them without evidence is problematic. Also, the method of trying to test them by forcing consumption is not supportive. The author should focus on supporting her dietary needs unless there's a legitimate reason to question them, which would require professional consultation. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they're not respecting her health choices and are suggesting actions that could harm the relationship's trust.\n"
