As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is wrong. The situation is about doubting his girlfriend's reported intolerances to gluten, lactose, and sugar, which he finds extremely rare. He's skeptical because he's heard of cases where parents might falsely claim their children have intolerances. He's been trying to get her to eat these foods again to test if the intolerances are real, but he's hesitant to secretly give her the foods because he doesn't want to cross a trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Doubting someone's health issues can be a sensitive topic. On one hand, the author is concerned about his girlfriend's health and the restrictions these intolerances place on her diet. On the other hand, he's questioning her credibility without clear evidence, which might be seen as dismissive of her health concerns.\n\nThe girlfriend has reported having these intolerances, which are medical conditions. Even if they're rare, they can be valid. The author's approach of suggesting she try the foods again to test her reactions could be seen as a way to help her, but his methods might be problematic. Pressuring someone to consume foods they believe they're allergic or intolerant to could cause anxiety or physical harm if they actually are intolerant. Also, secretly giving her these foods without her consent is definitely crossing a trust line, which his friends suggested but he correctly dismissed.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author should ideally discuss his concerns with his girlfriend first, rather than trying to test her reactions behind her back. If she has a legitimate medical condition, there might be medical documentation or professional diagnoses that could address his doubts. However, even if she doesn't have the medical documents, that doesn't necessarily mean she's faking it. People's bodies can develop intolerances over time, and self-diagnosis is possible too.\n\nThe key here is trust and respect. The author's skepticism might stem from concern, but doubting her without evidence and potentially pressuring her to eat things she avoids could damage trust in the relationship. It's important to respect her health choices unless there's a clear reason to suspect otherwise, which in this case, the author hasn't provided. The fact that she developed these intolerances later in life is possible, but that doesn't make them invalid. \n\nAdditionally, the author's friends' suggestion to test her without her knowledge is unethical, and the fact that he's considering it but deciding against it shows he's aware of the boundaries. However, his public questioning and prodding her to eat the foods might still be seen as disrespectful to her health concerns. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's intentions might be to help, but his approach is likely causing the girlfriend distress and not addressing the issue in a respectful manner. Therefore, he might be in the wrong. But I need to make sure that there's a clear ethical line here. If she's genuinely sick, doubting her is harmful. If she's not, then maybe he's justified. But without evidence, he's assuming the worst, which is not good. So the answer is AITA: Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
