As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances. The situation involves gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which he considers rare. He's skeptical, mentions mothers faking it, and has been trying to get her to test it again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend has these intolerances, and the author is questioning their validity. His skepticism might stem from genuine concern, but how is he approaching it? He's suggesting she try the foods again, which she used to tolerate. He's also mentioned friends suggesting a test by giving her gluten or lactose without her consent, which he thinks is crossing a line. The user is split between wanting her to eat normally and respecting her health.\n\nKey points: The author's doubt could be based on misinformation. It's not that rare for people to develop intolerances later in life. The fact that he's pushing her to try the foods again might be dismissive of her symptoms. If she's genuinely experiencing adverse effects, forcing her to consume them could harm their relationship and her health. Also, the suggestion to test without her consent is a breach of trust. Even if he's concerned, the method is problematic. Trust in a relationship is crucial, and doubting her health issues without evidence might be seen as undermining her experience.\n\nOn the other hand, his intention is to help her eat more freely. But the approach is questionable. The right approach would be to encourage medical testing or professional consultation rather than pushing her to consume potentially harmful substances. If her symptoms are real, ignoring them or challenging them without proof can lead to health issues. The author's friends' advice is wrong, as it's unethical to test without consent. The author is aware this is crossing a line, so he's already considering the wrongness of that action.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's doubting her without evidence and suggesting harmful actions, yes. However, if he's just concerned and trying to find a solution, maybe not. But the act of pushing her to consume something she's avoiding, especially without her agreement, is problematic. It shows a lack of trust in her self-reporting of her health. People's health issues are personal and valid unless proven otherwise by medical professionals. His approach is both skeptical and possibly harmful. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he's not supporting her health concerns and is acting in a way that could damage their relationship.\n"
