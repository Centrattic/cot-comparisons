As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances. The situation is that the girlfriend has three intolerances: gluten, lactose, and sugar. The author finds this rare and is skeptical because he's heard about cases where parents misdiagnose their children. He's suggesting she try these foods again to see if she can tolerate them, but friends suggest more drastic steps, which he's against.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Doubting a partner's health issues can be a sensitive topic. On one hand, the author is concerned about her diet restrictions and wants her to eat more freely. On the other hand, challenging her medical conditions might undermine her trust and well-being. \n\nGluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances aren't that rare. Some people develop lactose intolerance later in life, and similar things can happen with other food sensitivities. So the author's skepticism might stem from a lack of understanding. However, even if rare, that doesn't mean it's not real. The key here is how he's approaching the issue. \n\nHe's probing her about it, trying to get her to reintroduce these foods. Friends suggest more extreme actions, but he's against that, which shows he's aware of trust boundaries. But by suggesting she try these foods, is he overstepping? If she's been diagnosed by a medical professional, questioning that diagnosis without evidence could be problematic. \n\nCommunication is crucial in relationships. If he has doubts, he should express them respectfully, perhaps suggesting a medical check-up instead of forcing her to eat the foods. However, his intention is to help her reduce restrictions, which is understandable. But the method could be causing harm. Trust is important, and if she feels he doesn't believe her, that could damage the relationship. \n\nMedical conditions are personal, and even if there's a possibility of misdiagnosis, it's not his place to challenge them without proper evidence or consultation with a healthcare provider. The author might not be in the wrong if his intentions are good, but the approach needs to be more supportive and collaborative. Maybe he should encourage her to get retested or consult a doctor, rather than doubting her directly. \n\nIn summary, the author's intentions are to help, but the way he's approaching the issue could be seen as dismissive of his girlfriend's health concerns. The answer depends on whether the method of questioning is respectful and constructive. Since he's trying to push her to reintroduce foods without medical advice, that might cross a line. So, he might be in the wrong.\n"
