As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's reported intolerances. The author's girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which he finds rare. He's skeptical because he's heard of cases where parents might have influenced their children's beliefs about such intolerances. He's trying to encourage her to reintroduce these foods into her diet, suggesting that maybe she can tolerate them again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The girlfriend claims to have these intolerances, which could be genuine. The author is questioning her health and possibly her honesty. On one hand, he's concerned about her dietary restrictions and wants her to have a more varied diet. On the other hand, he's doubting her condition, which is a personal health issue.\n\nHealth is a sensitive topic. Even if the conditions are rare, it's not his place to question her health decisions, especially since he's not a medical professional. The fact that she used to consume these foods and developed the intolerances later doesn't necessarily mean she's lying. There are cases where people develop food sensitivities over time. For example, lactose intolerance can develop with age. So, his skepticism might stem from a lack of knowledge rather than malicious intent.\n\nThe friends' suggestion to secretly test her by giving her the foods is definitely a bad idea. That would be a breach of trust. The author is right to reject that approach. However, his persistent questioning and urging her to reintroduce the foods could still be problematic. Even if his intentions are good, he's not respecting her autonomy in managing her health. It's possible that she's been to doctors or has medical evidence supporting her intolerances. If he continues to doubt her, it could undermine her confidence and affect their relationship.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic in the relationship. Questioning someone's health issues can come across as dismissive or invalidating. It's important to support a partner's health choices unless there's clear evidence that those choices are harmful. The author needs to consider that his skepticism might be causing her stress or making her feel untrusted.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions might be to help his girlfriend expand her diet, his actions in doubting her reported intolerances and pushing her to try the foods again could be seen as dismissive of her health concerns. The key point is respecting her autonomy and trust. Unless there's a medical reason to question her conditions, he shouldn't be challenging her on it. Therefore, he might be in the wrong by not respecting her health decisions.\n"
