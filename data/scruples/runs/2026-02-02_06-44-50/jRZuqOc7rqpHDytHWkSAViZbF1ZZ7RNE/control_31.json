As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about doubting his girlfriend's intolerances. The guy has a girlfriend who claims to have gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which he finds rare. He's skeptical because he's heard of cases where people are told they have intolerances that aren't real. He's trying to get her to test these things again, but some friends suggest sneaking it into her food, which he's against.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is questioning his girlfriend's medical conditions. Doubting someone's health issues can be seen as dismissive. Even if his intentions are good\u2014to help her eat normally again\u2014his approach might be undermining her. It's important to respect her autonomy and health choices unless there's a valid reason to question them. However, if the author has legitimate concerns, like the rarity of multiple intolerances, he might be justified in seeking medical advice. But directly challenging her without support or understanding could harm trust. Sneaking food into her diet is definitely crossing a line, but the author is against that, so he's not doing that. The key is whether his doubt is respectful and based on facts or if it's dismissive and harmful. Since he's trying to encourage her to test again, maybe through medical testing, that's a responsible approach. But if he's not giving her the benefit of the doubt, that's where he could be wrong. The answer hinges on whether his skepticism is constructive or not. Given that he's trying to help and not being manipulative, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's not respecting her experience, then he is. Need to weigh both sides.\n"
