As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances. The girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which he finds rare. He mentions that these issues developed later in life, and he's heard of cases where parents might falsely claim a child has an intolerance. He's tried to get her to test it again but some friends suggested sneaking it into her food, which he's against.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle here. Doubting someone's health conditions can be sensitive. Even if the user is skeptical, challenging someone's medical issues directly might not be the best approach. The girlfriend's well-being and trust are important. If she's been diagnosed by a healthcare professional, then the user's doubt could come off as dismissive of her health. However, if there's no proper diagnosis, maybe there's a point. But the user's approach of urging her to try foods again might not be respectful of her current choices. The friends' suggestion to secretly test her is definitely crossing a trust line, and the user is right to avoid that. However, openly doubting her and pushing her to test without her consent might still be hurtful. The key is whether the user's actions are respectful. Since he's trying to get her to reconsider without forcing it, maybe it's not entirely wrong, but the doubt itself could be seen as dismissive. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if the doubt without evidence is problematic. Since the user is concerned about trust and not wanting to cross lines, even if he's skeptical, he's being cautious. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
