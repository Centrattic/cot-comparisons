As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author finds rare. The author is skeptical because they've heard of cases where people were misdiagnosed or parents influenced the diagnosis. The author is trying to get her to eat those foods again, thinking she might have developed them as a child but could tolerate them now. Some friends suggest secretly testing her, but the author thinks that crosses a trust line.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author's intentions might be to help her eat more freely, but questioning her health claims directly could undermine trust. Even if the author's concerns are based on real cases of misdiagnosis, approaching the girlfriend with skepticism might make her feel disbelieved. The author is trying to encourage her to reintroduce foods, which could be seen as supportive, but the method of doubt might be harmful. Also, the friends' suggestion to secretly test her reactions is definitely crossing a line, but the author is aware of that and chooses not to go that route. However, the author's public doubt and pushing her to try these foods could still be problematic. Trust in a relationship is crucial, and doubting a partner's health issues without evidence might be seen as dismissive. On the other hand, the author isn't acting recklessly but is concerned about the diet restrictions. It's a balance between support and skepticism. So, the answer might hinge on whether doubting her conditions without evidence is wrong, even if done with good intentions. I think the author might be in the wrong because they should trust her health claims unless there's clear evidence to the contrary, and questioning it could harm the relationship.\n"
