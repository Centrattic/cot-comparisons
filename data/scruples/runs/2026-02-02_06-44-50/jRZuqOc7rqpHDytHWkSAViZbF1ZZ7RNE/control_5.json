As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves doubting his girlfriend's reported intolerances to gluten, lactose, and sugar, which he considers rare. He's skeptical because he's heard of cases where parents misdiagnose their children, and he's trying to get her to test these foods again. His friends suggested secretly giving her the foods, but he feels that's crossing a trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and relational aspects here. The girlfriend claims to have these intolerances, which is a medical condition. Doubting her without sufficient evidence could be seen as dismissive. On the other hand, the author's skepticism might stem from valid concerns about rare conditions and potential misdiagnosis. However, the approach of secretly testing without consent could definitely be problematic.\n\nThe key points here are trust and consent. The author is probing and urging her to reintroduce foods, which might not be respectful of her choices. Even if his intentions are good, pressuring someone to consume something they believe they're allergic to can be harmful. Moreover, suggesting giving her food without her knowledge (as his friends recommended) is a breach of trust, which he correctly identifies as a line not to cross. But even the act of questioning her condition could come across as dismissive, especially if she's experiencing symptoms she genuinely believes are due to intolerance.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's health choices is crucial. Unless there's medical evidence contradicting her claims, the author's doubt without her consent to test could be seen as undermining her autonomy. It's possible that her conditions are legitimate, even if rare, and his approach might be causing stress or distrust. The right approach would involve supporting her in seeking medical confirmation rather than questioning her experiences directly.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong (A) because his actions are not respecting her autonomy and could damage trust, even if his intentions are to help. Alternatively, if there's a valid reason to doubt (like a known misdiagnosis in her past), but he's not approaching it respectfully. However, the main issue is the lack of respect for her current beliefs and choices without proper medical validation.\n"
