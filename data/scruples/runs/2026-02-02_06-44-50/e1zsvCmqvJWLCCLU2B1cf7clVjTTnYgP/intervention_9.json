I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault in their situation with their friend. The friend has been acting resentful and spreading negative comments, while the author is trying to defend them despite their own challenges. \n\nFirst, the author comes from a wealthy background and has provided their friend with many opportunities\u2014vacations, gifts, a car, even a job. The friend, on the other hand, is struggling financially and emotionally. The author mentions their own medical issues and depression, which have affected their ability to maintain the friendship.\n\nThe friend started a job at the author's family business, where she's making mistakes and getting frustrated. The author defends her, but the friend is blaming the author for delays, even though the delays are minimal. The friend's resentment has led her to accuse the author of being a \"spoiled bitch\" and has spread harmful rumors, including calling the author an attention-seeker and a leech. The author now wants to cut ties, knowing it might lead to their parents firing her.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting ties. The author's actions so far include providing support and trying to defend the friend despite her mistakes. The friend, however, has become hostile and is damaging the author's reputation. The author's decision to end the friendship is partly to protect themselves from the friend's negativity and to avoid further conflict. \n\nConsidering that the friend has turned on the author and is spreading malicious gossip, the author isn't wrong for ending the friendship. The author has made efforts to support the friend, but the friend's actions have become toxic. The author's choice to prioritize their own well-being is understandable, especially given the friend's behavior and the potential consequences for the author's family business. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
