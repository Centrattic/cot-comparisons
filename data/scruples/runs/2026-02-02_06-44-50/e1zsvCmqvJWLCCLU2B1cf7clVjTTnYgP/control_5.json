I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is between two friends where one (the author) is from a well-off family and the other (the friend) is not as fortunate. They've been friends a long time, and the friend has been given a lot of support, like family vacations, gifts, even a car. The author points out that their lives have taken different paths: the author graduated without debt, moved out, and works in the family business, while the friend is in debt, hasn't moved out, and works in the warehouse of the same business.\n\nNow, the friend is acting resentful, blaming the author for her mistakes at work, spreading negative things about her, and being two-faced. The author is dealing with personal and medical issues, which might be affecting their work efficiency. The friend has started to call the author a spoiled attention-seeker and is spreading this to others, leading to the author's friends confronting them about becoming a bitch.\n\nThe author is considering cutting off the friend, knowing that without their support, the friend might lose her job. The question is whether the author is at fault for ending the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author has provided a lot of support over the years, including financial help and job opportunities. The friend, on the other hand, is struggling and seems to be taking out her frustrations on the author. The author is defending the friend at work despite the friend's mistakes, which shows some loyalty, but the friend is ungrateful and spreading malicious rumors.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, the friend's behavior is toxic and unappreciative. The author has a right to feel hurt and want to distance themselves, especially when the friend is undermining them. The friend's actions are harmful, not just to the author but also to the business by making costly errors. The author's decision to end the friendship might be a way to protect their own well-being and the business's interests.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's resentment might stem from feeling overshadowed or unappreciated. However, the way she's handling it is clearly wrong. The author isn't to blame for her struggles; the friend's reaction is disproportionate. The author has tried to support her, and despite that, she's still choosing to blame and attack them.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's ungratefulness and toxicity versus the author's efforts and the need to set boundaries. The author isn't responsible for the friend's job security in the long run; that's up to the employer (the author's parents). The author's decision to end the friendship isn't malicious but a response to being mistreated. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
