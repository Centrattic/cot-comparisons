I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a complicated friendship where there's a big difference in their life circumstances. The friend comes from a less privileged background and the author is from a wealthy family. They've been close friends for a long time, but things have deteriorated since the friend started working at the author's family business.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the friend has started acting resentful, making false accusations about the author's mental health, spreading negative things behind their back, and being toxic. The friend even told the author's boyfriend bad things. The author is now considering cutting off the friendship, knowing that this might lead to the friend losing her job if the parents stop supporting her. The question is whether the author is at fault for ending the friendship.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, they've tried to support the friend by offering help, like a place to live. They've defended the friend at work despite her making mistakes. The friend, on the other hand, has become hostile and manipulative. The author is dealing with their own medical issues and depression, which is affecting their ability to be as active a friend as before. The friend isn't helping but is instead blaming the author for her problems.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's behavior versus the author's actions. The author has provided support in multiple ways (financial, housing), and even given opportunities at work. The friend's response is resentment and betrayal. The author is now choosing to cut ties because of the friend's toxicity. Since the friend is being manipulative and spreading lies, it's hard to see how the author is in the wrong. Even though the author is in a better position, the friend's actions justify the decision to end the friendship. The author isn't trying to sabotage the friend but is trying to protect their own well-being. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
