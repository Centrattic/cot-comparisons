I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation is complicated.\n\nFirst, the friend comes from a less privileged background. The author's family has supported her a lot\u2014vacations, gifts, even a car. The friend is struggling financially, has debt, and can't move out. The author offered her a job in the family business, but now there's tension. The friend is making mistakes, and the author is defending her. But the friend is now being resentful, blaming the author's medical issues for her mistakes, and spreading negativity. The author is considering cutting ties, knowing it might lead to the friend losing her job and support.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that she's been generous, but the friend is ungrateful and toxic. The friend's actions are hurting the author's reputation and work environment. The author is dealing with her own medical issues and depression, which might affect her performance. The friend is not only unappreciative but also spreading lies, making the author look bad. The author feels justified in cutting ties because the friend is undermining her.\n\nBut there are other angles. The author's family has supported the friend financially, which might create expectations. The friend's resentment could stem from feeling like she's not being given enough help, even though she has received a lot. The author is in a position of power both as a friend and in the workplace. By cutting ties, the author might be causing the friend to lose her job and support, which could be harsh.\n\nHowever, the friend's behavior is clearly toxic. She's spreading lies, being unprofessional, and blaming the author for things beyond her control. The author is trying to defend her despite the issues, but the friend is exploiting that. The author's mental health is also a factor here\u2014she's dealing with depression and medical issues, which the friend is attacking instead of supporting.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the friend's actions are the root of the problem. She's ungrateful, unprofessional, and toxic. The author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship that's one-sided and harmful. The author is not at fault for wanting to protect herself and her own well-being. Even though cutting ties might affect the friend's job, the friend's behavior has already put her job at risk through her mistakes and bad attitude.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend's actions have led to the breakdown, not the author's generosity or support. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
