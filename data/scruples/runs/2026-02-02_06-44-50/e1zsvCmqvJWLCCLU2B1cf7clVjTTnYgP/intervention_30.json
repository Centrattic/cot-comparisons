I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation is pretty complex. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author and her friend have been close for a long time, but there's a big difference in their life circumstances. The author comes from a wealthy family, her friend does not. The friend has been given a lot from the author's family, like vacations, gifts, and a car. The author has had an easier life academically and financially, graduating without debt, while the friend has over $50k in debt and struggles with finding a good job.\n\nThe friend took a job at the author's family business but isn't performing well and is making mistakes. The author has been defending her, but the friend is now resentful, blaming the author for her issues. The friend spreads negative things about the author, even calling her names to her boyfriend and others. The author wants to cut off the friendship but is worried about the friend's job and financial support from the author's parents.\n\nSo, the key points here are the friend's resentment and betrayal versus the author's position of privilege and continued support. The author is considering ending the friendship, possibly leading to the friend losing her job and support. The question is: is the author in the wrong?\n\nI need to consider both sides. The friend's actions are definitely hurtful and unkind. Spreading rumors, pretending to be nice, and attacking the author's character are serious issues. The author, on the other hand, has been supportive by defending her despite the friend's poor performance. However, the author's privilege might contribute to the friend's resentment, but the friend's actions cross into toxicity.\n\nThe author's decision to end the friendship might be justified given the friend's behavior. However, cutting off support could have negative consequences for the friend. But the author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship that's become harmful. The friend's actions are more directly at fault here. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to end the friendship, especially since the friend has been abusive and disloyal. The answer is probably B.\n"
