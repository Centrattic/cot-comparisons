I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is complicated.\n\nFirst, the author comes from a wealthy family and their friend does not. The friend has been given a lot of support\u2014vacations, gifts, even a car. The author has a good job with the family business and the friend works there in the warehouse. The friend is struggling financially and has a lot of debt. The author tried to help by offering a place to live but was rejected. Now the friend is making mistakes at work and blaming the author, even spreading negative things about them to others. The author is dealing with personal medical issues and depression, which might affect their work performance, but not to the point of affecting the friend's tasks. The friend is now being resentful and confrontational, leading the author to consider cutting ties.\n\nI need to assess who's at fault here. The friend's actions seem pretty harsh. She's accusing the author of being a spoiled attention-seeker and spreading harmful things. Even if the author is more privileged, the friend's response is aggressive and unkind. The author tried to help in the past and is defending her now at work. The friend's resentment might stem from jealousy, but that doesn't justify her behavior. The author isn't forcing her to work there; the job was offered, and the friend accepted. The author's decision to stop being friends might be justified given the friend's actions, especially if the friend is being toxic.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could consider if there's a way to address the friend's issues without cutting ties, but given the friend's hostility and the impact on the author's life, it's understandable. The key here is the friend's behavior. The author isn't the one spreading rumors or being unkind. So the author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship if the friend is being toxic. The answer is B.\n"
