I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is at fault (AITA) in their situation with their friend. The author is questioning if they're in the wrong (Option A) or not (Option B). The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, let's outline the key points from the scenario. The author and their friend have been close for a long time. The author comes from a wealthier background, provides multiple gifts, and even helped their friend with a car. The friend has financial struggles, student debt, and lives with her parents. The friend was offered a job at the author's family business, which they accepted. However, the relationship has deteriorated after the friend started working there. The friend is now making mistakes, blaming the author, and spreading negative comments. The author is dealing with health and depression issues, which might affect their work. The author considers ending the friendship, knowing it could lead to the friend losing her job and support.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author is in a better financial position and has provided support. However, the friend's behavior has become resentful and toxic. The author is trying to defend their friend at work despite her mistakes. The friend is spreading harmful rumors, which the author finds out through others. The author is considering cutting off the friendship, which could have consequences for the friend.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are the friend's actions versus the author's. The friend's resentment and spreading lies are significant. The author has tried to be supportive, even when the friend made mistakes. The author is also dealing with personal issues, which might contribute to being less available as a friend. However, the friend's behavior seems to be the main issue. The author is not forcing the friendship; they want to end it due to the friend's negativity. The potential fallout for the friend (losing job support) is a consequence, but the author might not be responsible for that if the friend's behavior is the root cause.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could be seen as not handling the situation gracefully. Maybe they could have addressed the friend's issues more directly before cutting off. However, the friend's actions are hostile and damaging. The author has a right to end a friendship that's harmful. So, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship due to the friend's toxic behavior. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
