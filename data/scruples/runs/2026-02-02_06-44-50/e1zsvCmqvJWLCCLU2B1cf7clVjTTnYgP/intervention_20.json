I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user says they think the author is in the wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The author and their friend have been close for a long time. The author comes from a wealthier background and has given the friend many gifts and opportunities, like a car and offering to let her live with them. The friend, on the other hand, has financial struggles, is in debt, and hasn't been as successful. Now, after starting a job at the author's family business, their relationship has deteriorated. The friend is acting resentful, making false accusations, and spreading negative things about the author. The author is considering cutting off the friendship, knowing that might lead to the friend losing her job and support from the author's parents.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault (AITA). The user thinks the author is in the wrong (A), but I need to decide based on the details.\n\nKey points to consider: The author has done a lot to support the friend financially and socially. The friend, however, is behaving in a toxic manner, spreading rumors, and being resentful. The author is under personal medical stress, which might affect their work, but the friend is blaming them. The author is defending the friend at work despite the friend's mistakes. The friend is turning on the author, even confronting their parents and boyfriend.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship that's toxic. The friend's actions\u2014spreading lies, being resentful, and pretending to be nice\u2014suggest a breach of trust and genuine malice. The author is justified in ending the friendship, especially given the friend's behavior. However, the author is aware that ending the friendship might lead to the friend losing her job, which could be a factor in whether they're considered at fault.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The friend's actions seem to be the main issue here. The author is responding to betrayal and toxicity. The author's financial privilege isn't a fault unless they're exploiting the friend, but the context shows they've supported the friend. The friend's resentment might stem from jealousy, but the author isn't responsible for that. The author isn't doing anything wrong by prioritizing their well-being and cutting off someone who's toxic.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). The friend's behavior is the main problem here, not the author's decisions to end the friendship.\n"
