I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is between two friends with different life circumstances. The author comes from a wealthy background, has a good job, and their parents have supported the friend financially. The friend, on the other hand, is struggling with debt, hasn't found a good job, and now works in the family business warehouse.\n\nThe author has been trying to help the friend, even offering to let her live with them, which the friend declined due to a dog. The friend is now making mistakes at work, blaming the author, and spreading negative things about them. The author is considering cutting off the friendship but is worried about the consequences for the friend since the parents might fire her if they stop supporting her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's background gives them a lot of advantages, but they've tried to help the friend. The friend, however, is acting out, spreading lies, and being resentful. The author is stressed with medical issues and depression, which they've communicated but maybe not effectively enough.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's behavior: spreading rumors, blaming the author, and pretending to be nice. The author is justified in wanting to end the friendship due to the friend's actions. The author's support, like helping with vacations and a car, doesn't obligate the friend to be loyal. The friend's resentment might stem from jealousy, but that doesn't excuse her behavior.\n\nThe author is not the one in the wrong here. The friend's actions are harmful and insincere. The author is ending the friendship as a result of the friend's behavior, not just their different life situations. Even though the author is in a better position, it's about mutual respect and boundaries. The author has a right to protect their well-being and end a toxic relationship. The potential consequences for the friend are a result of her own actions and the employer's (the author's parents) decisions, which the author isn't directly controlling. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
