I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation involves a long-time friend from a less affluent background who's now working in the author's family business. The friend is making mistakes, blaming the author, and spreading negative things about her. The author wants to end the friendship but is worried about the consequences.\n\nFirst, the author comes from a wealthy family and has had easier life circumstances. The friend has financial struggles and debt. The author offered help, like a place to stay, but the friend declined. Now, at work, the friend is performing poorly and is resentful, even attacking the author's mental health and relationships.\n\nThe author is considering cutting ties to protect themselves from further harm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the friendship. \n\nFrom one angle, the author has done a lot to support the friend despite their differences. They've defended the friend at work and given them opportunities. The friend's behavior is hostile and unfounded. The author's decision to end the friendship might be justified as self-preservation, especially since the friend is toxic and spreading lies.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might be acting out of frustration due to their own struggles. The author's privilege could make them less empathetic to the friend's situation. However, the friend's actions\u2014spreading rumors, attacking the author's health and relationships\u2014are clear violations of trust and respect. The author has the right to distance themselves from someone who is actively harming them, especially in a professional setting where the friend's performance could affect the business.\n\nConsidering the friend's malicious behavior and the author's efforts to be supportive, the author's decision to end the friendship isn't necessarily wrong. The friend's actions have crossed into bullying and betrayal, which can justify cutting ties. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
