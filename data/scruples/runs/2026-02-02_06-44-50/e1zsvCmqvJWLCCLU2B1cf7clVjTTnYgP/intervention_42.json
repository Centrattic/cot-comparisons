I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated with multiple layers. First, the friend feels that the author is spoiled and is being a bitch, while the author thinks the friend is just jealous. \n\nThe author comes from a well-off family and has had an easier life, including financial support and opportunities like family vacations and a gifted car. The friend, on the other hand, is struggling financially, has debt, and can't move out. The author offered help by letting the friend live with her, but the friend declined because of the dog allergy. \n\nAt work, the friend is making mistakes in the warehouse job, and the author is defending her despite the parents' frustration. The friend is blaming the author for her mistakes, which the author thinks are minor. The friend has been spreading negative things about the author, calling her a leech and an attention-seeker. The author is feeling betrayed and wants to cut ties, knowing that without her support, the friend might lose her job.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the friendship despite the friend's behavior. Let's break it down. The author has tried to support the friend financially and emotionally, even offering a place to stay. However, the friend's resentment is leading to harmful actions, including spreading lies and damaging the workplace environment. The author is justified in feeling hurt and frustrated by the friend's actions. Ending a friendship where the other person is being toxic and spreading falsehoods is generally acceptable. \n\nThe friend's behavior seems to stem from jealousy and personal issues, not the author's actions. The author's medical condition and efforts to defend the friend despite her mistakes show that she's trying to maintain the relationship. However, when the friend turns hostile and undermines her, the author has a right to protect herself. \n\nConsidering that the author is not responsible for the friend's financial struggles or her inability to manage work, the author isn't in the wrong for cutting ties. The friend's actions are unprofessional and harmful, which justifies the author's decision. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
