I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author and their friend have been close since forever. The author comes from a wealthy family, while the friend does not. The friend has been included in family vacations and even received a car from the author's parents. The author has had an easier life, graduating debt-free with a scholarship, while the friend has significant debt and struggles with her career.\n\nThe friend was given a job at the family business, which paid well. However, since starting there, their friendship has deteriorated. The author has been dealing with medical issues and depression, leading to less social interaction. The friend has been making mistakes at work and is blaming the author for not getting orders entered quickly enough, which is only a 30-minute delay. The author defends the friend because of her good intentions but the friend starts spreading negative things about the author, even calling the author's boyfriend to suggest breaking up. Now, the author wants to cut ties, knowing that if they do, their parents might fire the friend because she's an underperforming employee.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault here. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants the assistant's opinion. \n\nFirst, consider the friend's actions. She has been spreading harmful rumors, being nice to the author's face but harsh behind their back, and even attacking the author's personal relationships. That's pretty toxic behavior. The friend also blames the author for her work mistakes, which seems unfair. The author has tried to support the friend by offering a job, but the friend's response has been resentment and betrayal.\n\nOn the author's side, they've been kind, providing financial support, helping with housing, and defending the friend at work despite her mistakes. The author's medical issues and depression are legitimate and probably affect their ability to perform at work, but they are still doing their best. The author is also aware of the potential consequences of cutting ties and is considering it regardless, which shows some conflict but also a desire to protect themselves from further harm.\n\nThe friend's resentment seems to stem from jealousy and perhaps a sense of inadequacy. She might feel overshadowed by the author's success and wealth, leading to her negative behavior. However, that doesn't excuse her actions. The author isn't responsible for the friend's feelings of jealousy unless they've acted in a way that's intentionally cruel, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nThe author is within their rights to end the friendship if it's causing them stress and harm. The friend's actions have crossed the line into toxicity, and the author is justified in prioritizing their well-being. The fact that the friend is an employee complicates things, but the author's personal relationship is separate from the professional one. The author isn't obligated to maintain the friendship just because of work.\n\nIn conclusion, the friend's actions are the main issue here. The author has done a lot to support the friend, but the friend's response is unacceptable. The author is not in the wrong for ending the friendship to protect themselves from further emotional harm. So, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
