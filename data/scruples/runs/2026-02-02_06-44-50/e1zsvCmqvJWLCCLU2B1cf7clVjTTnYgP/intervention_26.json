I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's upset about the author's wealth and circumstances, leading to a strained relationship.\n\nFirst, the author comes from a well-off family, which has provided her friend with gifts, vacations, and even a car. The friend, on the other hand, has financial struggles, student debt, and lives with her parents. The author offered her a place to stay but she declined due to her dog. Now, the friend is working in the family business, making mistakes, and blaming the author for her issues. The author defends her but has personal health issues.\n\nThe friend is being resentful, spreading negative things about the author, and acting nice to her face. The author wants to end the friendship, knowing it might affect her parents' support for the friend's job. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting ties.\n\nI need to consider if the author is justified. The friend's behavior seems toxic and ungrateful, spreading lies and being unkind. The author has supported her in many ways but is now facing backlash. Ending the friendship could be seen as self-preservation. However, the author's knowledge that this might lead to the friend losing her job adds complexity. But the friend is already making costly errors, so maybe the job is at risk regardless. The author's health issues also play a role in her reduced availability. \n\nThe friend's actions\u2014spreading rumors, blaming the author, being insincere\u2014are clearly harmful. The author defending her despite the friend's behavior shows loyalty, but when the friend turns toxic, it's reasonable to distance. The author isn't responsible for the friend's job; the friend's performance is the main issue. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the friend's actions justify the author ending the friendship.\n"
