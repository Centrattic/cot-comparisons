I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a long-time friend who now resents the author, leading to a breakdown in their relationship. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author comes from a wealthy family and has been generous with their friend, providing vacations, gifts, even a car. The friend, on the other hand, is struggling financially and with school debt. The author mentions that they offered the friend a place to stay but couldn't because of the dog allergy. The friend is now working in the family business's warehouse, a job offered by the author's parents. \n\nThe friend has started blaming the author for work mistakes, spreading rumors, and acting nice to their face but being mean behind their back. The author is dealing with medical issues and depression, which might affect their work performance slightly. The friend has accused the author of being a spoiled attention-seeker and even told the author's boyfriend to break up with them. The author is considering cutting ties but is worried about the friend losing her job and support.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. To determine this, I need to consider both sides. The author has been generous, but the friend is acting out of resentment. The friend's behavior is clearly toxic\u2014spreading falsehoods and being disloyal. The author is trying to support the friend by defending her at work despite her mistakes. However, the friend's actions are unkind and destructive.\n\nThe author's decision to end the friendship could be justified given the friend's behavior. The friend's jealousy and resentment are driving her actions, and she's not taking responsibility for her mistakes. The author is not at fault for the friend's jealousy or for setting boundaries after being treated poorly. The friend's actions are the root problem here. The author is not in the wrong for wanting to protect themselves from a toxic friendship, even if it means the friend loses her job. The author's parents' support is conditional, so if the friend's behavior leads to her being let go, that's a consequence of her actions, not the author's.\n"
