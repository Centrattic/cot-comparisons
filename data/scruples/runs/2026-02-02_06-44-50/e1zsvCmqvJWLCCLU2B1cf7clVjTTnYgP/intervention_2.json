I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong by ending the friendship with their friend. The situation is complicated with multiple factors.\n\nFirst, the friend comes from a less privileged background and has been in the author's life for a long time. The author has provided financial support like buying the friend a car and including her in family vacations. The friend has a significant amount of debt and struggles with finding a good job, which leads her to take a lower-paying warehouse job at the author's family business. \n\nThe author mentions having medical and personal issues that affect their ability to be as active a friend as before. The friend starts making mistakes at work and blames the author for not providing orders quickly enough, even though the delays are minimal. The friend's resentment grows to the point of calling the author names behind their back and spreading negativity. \n\nNow, the author is considering ending the friendship, knowing that this might lead to their parents terminating the friend's job. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting ties.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they've tried to be supportive and defend the friend despite the friend's behavior. The friend's actions are quite hostile, including spreading false accusations and being disloyal. The author's decision to end the friendship might be seen as self-preservation, especially since the friend is now being unkind and affecting the workplace environment. However, the author is aware that their parents are financially supporting the friend, which complicates the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's frustration might stem from feeling inadequate due to their different life circumstances. The author's privilege could contribute to the friend's jealousy, leading to resentment. The friend's actions, though, are clearly harmful and unkind. The author's response to end the friendship could be justified given the friend's behavior and the potential impact on their job. However, the author might feel conflicted because their parents are involved, and severing ties could have consequences.\n\nConsidering all aspects, the friend's actions are unkind and unprofessional, especially in a workplace setting. The author's decision to end the friendship is a reaction to being mistreated. While the author could have tried to address the friendship issues earlier, given the extent of the friend's behavior, it's hard to blame the author for cutting ties. The key point is the friend's hostility and the impact on the author's life and work environment. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
