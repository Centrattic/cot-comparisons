I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who the author helped a lot financially and in other ways. The friend now resents the author, accuses them of being spoiled, and is spreading negative things. The author is considering cutting off the friendship, knowing it might lead to the friend losing job support from the author's parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has been generous\u2014buying the friend a car, including her in family vacations, offering to let her live with them. The friend has financial struggles, is in debt, and hasn't been able to find a good job. But after getting a job through the author's parents, the friend's mistakes are causing issues, and she's blaming the author while spreading negativity. The author tried to defend her, but the friend is turning against them.\n\nThe author is dealing with health issues and depression, which affects their ability to manage work tasks. The friend is not taking responsibility for her errors and is instead projecting onto the author. The author feels done with the friendship because of the friend's behavior, even though they know cutting off might lead to job loss.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship that's toxic. The friend's actions (spreading lies, blaming others) are harmful. The author's generosity doesn't mean they have to tolerate disrespect. However, there's a moral consideration about the friend's financial vulnerability. But the friend's behavior seems to be the main issue here. The author isn't forcing the friend to work there; the job was offered, and the friend chose to take it. The author's role in her job support might be a factor, but the friend's actions are her own responsibility.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to end the friendship, especially given the friend's hostile behavior. The answer would be B (No) because the author is justified in ending the friendship after being mistreated.\n"
