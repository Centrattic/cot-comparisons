I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is that the author and their friend have been friends for a long time, but now the friend is being resentful and spreading bad things about the author. The author is considering cutting off the friendship, knowing that the friend's job might be at risk if they do.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The author comes from a wealthy family and has been supportive, giving their friend gifts, a car, and even job opportunities. The friend is in a worse financial situation, has debt, and struggles with finding a good job. The author offered her a job in the warehouse, which she took, but now the friend is blaming the author for her mistakes and spreading rumors. The author has medical issues that affect their work, but they defend the friend despite her errors. The friend is being passive-aggressive and toxic, pretending to be nice but spreading negativity behind the author's back.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect in a friendship and the dynamics of power. The author has been generous, but the friend is showing ingratitude and hostility. The author is considering ending the friendship to avoid being in a toxic situation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting ties, knowing that the friend's job might depend on the author's support through their parents.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. The friend is acting out of jealousy and resentment, which is not the author's fault. The author has tried to be supportive, but the friend's behavior is toxic. Ending the friendship is a personal choice, especially if it's affecting the author's well-being. The author isn't responsible for the friend's job security in the long run, especially since the friend has been unprofessional and difficult to work with. The friend's actions, like spreading rumors and being unkind, justify the author distancing themselves. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
