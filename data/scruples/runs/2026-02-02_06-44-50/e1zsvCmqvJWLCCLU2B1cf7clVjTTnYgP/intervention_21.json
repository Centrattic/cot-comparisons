I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The situation involves a long-time friend who's now working for the author's family business. The friend is from a less well-off background, and the author has been generous, giving her family trips, gifts, even a car. The friend is struggling with school debt, can't move out, and the author offered her a job at twice the market rate. Now, the friend is acting resentful, blaming the author for her mistakes, and spreading negative things about her. The author is considering cutting ties, knowing it might lead to her friend losing her job.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's friend might feel envious of the author's privileges and is frustrated with her own situation. She's making mistakes at work, which could be due to stress or lack of skills. The author is defending her, which is commendable, but if the friend is blaming the author for her issues, that's a problem. The author is also dealing with her own medical issues, which might affect her work performance slightly. The friend's behavior is clearly toxic, spreading rumors and being passive-aggressive.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's actions. She's being unkind, spreading lies, and pretending to be nice. The author, on the other hand, has provided support and opportunities. The friend's resentment might stem from feeling entitled or not appreciated, but that's no excuse for her behavior. The author isn't responsible for the friend's poor work performance or personal issues. \n\nThe author is considering cutting ties, which could affect the friend's job. However, the friend's actions have likely made the author feel betrayed and frustrated. The author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship, especially since the friend is acting out of jealousy and spite. The author has done her part by offering help and support. The friend's actions are her own responsibility. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
