I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is the asshole in the scenario described.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author and her friend have been close for a long time, and the author comes from a wealthier background. The friend has had a harder time financially, with student debt and struggles to find a good job. The author's parents have been generous, giving the friend gifts, a car, and a job. The friend later starts working in the family business, but their relationship deteriorates. The author is dealing with health and depression issues, which might have affected their friendship. The friend starts acting resentful, blaming the author for her mistakes, spreading negative things about her, and being two-faced. The author wants to end the friendship, knowing this might lead to her losing the job and the support from the author's parents.\n\nNow, considering the actions of both parties. The author's friend seems to be treating the author poorly, spreading rumors, and being unkind, especially after the author is trying to defend her at work despite the friend's mistakes. The author, on the other hand, has been supportive by offering a job, financial help, and even a place to stay. The friend is taking advantage of the author's generosity and then turning on her. The author is ending the friendship because of the friend's behavior, not out of spite but because the friend has become toxic. The friend's actions seem more harmful here\u2014spreading false accusations, being unkind, and undermining the author at work. The author is justified in cutting ties with someone who is being so negative and ungrateful, especially after the friend's behavior has already impacted the workplace and their personal relationships.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend's actions are the main issue here. The author has done what she can to support the friend and has even defended her at work. The friend's resentment and betrayal are the root of the problem. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
