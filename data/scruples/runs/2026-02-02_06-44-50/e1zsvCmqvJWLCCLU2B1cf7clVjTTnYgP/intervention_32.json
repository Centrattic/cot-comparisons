I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation with their friend. So, first, I need to understand both sides.\n\nThe author comes from a well-off family, and the friend is less fortunate. The friend has been close to the author's family, even getting gifts and a car. The author mentions that the friend now works at their family's business, and their relationship has deteriorated. The friend is blaming the author for her mistakes and spreading negative things. The author is considering cutting off the friend, knowing it might lead to the friend losing her job.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. The friend's behavior is clearly toxic\u2014spreading rumors, being resentful, and acting nice to their face. The author has tried to defend her at work, which shows some level of support. But the friend's actions are undermining the author's credibility and affecting their personal and professional lives.\n\nThe author is in a position of privilege, which might make the friend feel jealous or resentful. However, the friend's actions are not excusable. The author has the right to distance themselves from someone who is being harmful. The key point here is whether the author's decision to end the friendship is justified given the friend's behavior.\n\nThe author isn't necessarily at fault for the friend's resentment. The friend's issues stem from her own struggles and the author's success. The author is also dealing with medical and emotional issues, which the friend is publicly dismissing. The decision to end the friendship isn't malicious but a response to the toxicity. The author's concern about the friend's job stability is a real consequence, but it's not the author's fault the friend is making mistakes. The author isn't responsible for the friend's career; the friend's performance is her own responsibility.\n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to protect themselves from a harmful relationship, even if it means the friend loses some support. The friend's behavior is the main issue here, and the author's response is a form of self-preservation.\n"
