I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. First, I need to go through the details carefully.\n\nThe author and their friend have been friends a long time. The author is from a wealthy family, while their friend isn't. The friend has been included in family vacations, gotten gifts, even a new car from the author's parents. The author mentions their friend's struggles with school, debt, and living at home. The author offered a place for the friend to live but she declined because of her dog. \n\nNow, the author works in the family business. The friend started working in their warehouse, but she's making mistakes. The author defends her at work, but the friend is blaming the author for delays due to their medical issues. The friend is becoming resentful, calling the author a spoiled attention-seeker to their parents and boyfriend, and spreading negativity. The author feels the friend is pretending to be nice to their face but trash-talking behind their back. The author wants to end the friendship, knowing that without the family's support, the friend might lose her job.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the friend. The friend's actions seem hostile and unfounded. The author provided opportunities and support, but the friend is acting out, spreading rumors, and being unkind. The author is dealing with their own medical issues and hasn't been neglecting the friendship entirely. They've tried to defend the friend at work despite the friend's negative behavior.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's actions versus the author's. The author isn't necessarily at fault for the friend's resentment. The friend's behavior is toxic and unfounded, especially the personal attacks and spreading false accusations. The author is justified in wanting to end a friendship that's become toxic and harmful. Even though the author is in a more privileged position, it's not their fault for choosing to distance themselves from someone who is actively being malicious. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
