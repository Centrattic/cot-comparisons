I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The situation involves a friend who's been close for a long time but now there's a lot of tension. The author comes from a wealthy family, has had an easier life, and has given their friend various gifts and opportunities. The friend, on the other hand, is struggling with debt, can't afford to move out, and has a different life path. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that their friend now works at the family business in the warehouse, and there's been a breakdown in their friendship. The friend is making mistakes at work, blaming the author for delays, and spreading negative things about them. The author is dealing with medical issues and depression, which might affect their work performance. The friend accuses the author of being a spoiled attention-seeker and even told the boyfriend to break up with her.\n\nThe author is contemplating ending the friendship, knowing that it might lead to their parents firing the friend, which could hurt her financially. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides.\n\nThe author's perspective is that they've been generous, provided opportunities, and tried to support their friend despite their own challenges. They're feeling betrayed and hurt by the friend's behavior and want to end the friendship. The friend's perspective is that she's struggling and feels jealous or resentful about the author's advantages. She might feel taken advantage of or unappreciated, leading to her resentment and negative comments.\n\nNow, considering right and wrong. The author isn't necessarily at fault for their background or the opportunities they've had. People come from different circumstances, and that's not their fault. The friend's reaction seems to stem from jealousy and frustration, which is her issue to handle. However, the author might have a responsibility to address the friend's behavior if they're in a position to do so. But since the friendship is falling apart, perhaps the author isn't wrong to distance themselves, especially if the friend is spreading harmful lies and being toxic. The author also has their own medical issues to deal with, which adds to their stress.\n\nOn the other hand, ending the friendship could leave the friend without support, but that's a consequence of the friend's actions. The author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship that's becoming toxic. The friend's behavior seems more in the wrong here, as she's spreading lies and being resentful. The author's decision to end the friendship isn't necessarily malicious; it's a response to being treated poorly.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship. The friend's actions are more problematic, and the author has the right to protect their own well-being.\n"
