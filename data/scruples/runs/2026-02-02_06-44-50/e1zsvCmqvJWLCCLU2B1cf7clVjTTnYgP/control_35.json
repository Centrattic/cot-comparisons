I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong (AITA) after their friend turned against them. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author comes from a wealthy family and has been friends with this person since forever. The friend isn't as financially stable, lives with her parents, has student debt, and now works in the author's family business. The author has supported her with vacations, gifts, a car, and even offered a place to live. \n\nThe friend started working in the warehouse, and their friendship fell apart. The author has health issues and depression, which might have made them less available as a friend. The friend is struggling at work, making mistakes, and now blames the author for her problems. She's spreading negative things about the author and being two-faced. The author wants to cut ties but knows it might lead to her losing her job and the support she's gotten.\n\nSo, the main points here: The author has been generous, but the friend is acting out of jealousy and resentment. The friend is not only performing poorly at work but also being toxic. The author is defending her work-wise but can't handle the personal attacks. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author tried to help in multiple ways. The friend's behavior seems to stem from her own issues and jealousy, not the author's actions. The author isn't perfect\u2014maybe they could have communicated better, but the friend's actions (spreading rumors, being dishonest) are clearly problematic. The author's decision to end the friendship is in self-defense. Also, the author is aware of the consequences but still chooses to end it because the friendship is toxic. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, usually, if one person is acting out of spite without valid reason, they're the one in the wrong. The friend's jealousy and projection are key here. The author's actions (offering help, defending her at work) show they're trying to be fair. So the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
