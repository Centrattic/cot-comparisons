I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. The author is friends with someone who's been with them since forever, but there's a big gap in their life circumstances. The friend comes from a less well-off background, has struggled with debt and school, and now works for the author's family business. Their friendship is breaking down, and the friend is being resentful, even going as far as calling the author a \"spoiled bitch\" and spreading negative things about them.\n\nFirst, the author has been generous in the past\u2014gifts, family trips, even buying their friend a car. That's a lot, and maybe the friend feels that these things aren't enough or that the author is taking them for granted. But the author is now dealing with medical issues and depression, which is affecting their ability to be as active a friend as before. The friend, on the other hand, is making mistakes at work and blaming the author for not getting orders in fast enough. The author is trying to defend them, but the friend is turning the story around, even accusing the author of faking depression.\n\nThe author is considering cutting off the friendship, knowing that this would make their parents less supportive of the friend, potentially leading to her job loss. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the friendship under these circumstances.\n\nSo, looking at the dynamics: the author has done a lot to support the friend financially over the years. However, when the friend is struggling at work and in life, they're directing anger and resentment towards the author instead of addressing their own issues. The author is under stress from their health and can't be as present, but they're still trying to support the friend by defending them at work. The friend's behavior becomes toxic, spreading negativity and even confronting the author's partner. \n\nIs the author responsible for the friend's resentment? It seems the friend is projecting her own frustrations onto the author, which isn't fair. The author isn't the one causing the friend's financial or job problems. The friend's actions, like spreading lies, are clearly inappropriate. The author has a right to distance themselves from a toxic relationship, especially when it's affecting their work environment and personal life. \n\nHowever, the author is aware that cutting ties might lead to the friend losing her job and other support. But isn't the friend responsible for her own actions at work? The author's generosity doesn't obligate them to continue the friendship if it's becoming harmful. The friend's behavior is more to blame here. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and protecting their own well-being, especially when the friend is unkind and ungrateful. So, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
