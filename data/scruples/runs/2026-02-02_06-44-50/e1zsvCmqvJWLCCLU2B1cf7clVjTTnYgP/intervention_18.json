I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. Let me start by reading through the scenario carefully.\n\nThe author and their friend have been friends for a long time. The author comes from a wealthy family, and the friend is less well-off. The friend has been given various gifts and opportunities, like family vacations, a new car, and a job. The author has personal and medical issues, including depression, which have affected their availability as a friend. The friend, who works in the warehouse of the family business, is making many mistakes and has become resentful, blaming the author for her issues. The friend has started spreading negative things about the author and being insincere. The author is considering ending the friendship but is worried about the friend losing her job and support if they do so.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The author has been generous with their resources, offering the friend financial help and employment. The friend's resentment seems to stem from the author's perceived advantages and the author's reduced social presence due to health issues. The friend's actions, like spreading rumors and blaming the author, are clearly harmful. The author is defensive of the friend's intentions but frustrated by her mistakes. Now, the author is conflicted about cutting ties, knowing it might lead to the friend losing her job and support.\n\nThe key points to consider are: 1) The friend's actions are hostile and unfounded. 2) The author's generosity doesn't obligate them to endure abuse. 3) The friend's behavior is impacting both their personal and professional relationship. 4) The author's decision to end the friendship isn't just about personal feelings but also about maintaining their own well-being.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is seeking confirmation. I need to determine if the author's actions, particularly cutting off the friend, are justified. The friend's behavior is toxic and unprofessional. The author isn't responsible for the friend's resentment or the friend's work performance. Ending the friendship to protect themselves is a reasonable choice, especially given the friend's malicious actions. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own health and setting boundaries. Even though the friend might lose her job, the author isn't responsible for the friend's decisions or actions. The friendship is one-sided, with the author giving more support than the friend reciprocates, especially now with the friend's hostility.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
