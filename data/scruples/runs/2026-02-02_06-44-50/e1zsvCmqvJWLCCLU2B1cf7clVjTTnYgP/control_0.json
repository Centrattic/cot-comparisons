I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong (AITA) in their friend situation. Let me read through the details again.\n\nSo the author has a friend who's been close for a long time. The friend comes from a less well-off background, and the author's family has provided her with various things like vacations, gifts, even a car. The author is from a wealthy family, graduated debt-free, moved out at 18, and works in the family business. The friend, on the other hand, has struggled with school, has $50k in debt, is still living with her parents at 26, and works in the warehouse of the family business. \n\nThe friend's relationship with the author has deteriorated after starting work together. The author has health issues and depression, which they've mentioned, but have been less active as a friend. The friend is making mistakes at work, and the author defends her. However, the friend is blaming the author for her mistakes, spreading negative things about the author to others, even calling the author's boyfriend and making harmful statements. The author is considering cutting off the friendship, knowing that this might lead to the friend losing her job and the support she's been getting. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the friendship.\n\nFirst, let's look at the friend's actions. She's been spreading lies about the author, both to the family and the boyfriend. She's publicly trash-talking the author while pretending to be nice to their face. That's pretty toxic behavior. She's also blaming the author for her work mistakes, which seems unfair. The author is defending her at work, but the friend is turning it around. The friend's resentment seems to stem from jealousy of the author's more privileged position, but her actions are harmful and manipulative.\n\nOn the author's side, they've tried to be supportive, offered a job to the friend when she couldn't find one, and even offered room and board despite allergies. The author is dealing with personal medical issues and depression, which is a valid and challenging situation. They haven't been as active a friend, but they're doing their best. The author is also advocating for the friend at work despite the friend's poor performance and negativity.\n\nThe key here is the friend's behavior. When someone is spreading lies, making false accusations, and being toxic, it's reasonable for the person to distance themselves. The author isn't doing anything wrong by ending a toxic friendship. The friend's actions are harmful, and the author isn't responsible for her jealousy or resentment. The author is also considering the consequence that the friend might lose her job, but the author isn't directly causing that; it's the friend's poor performance and the parent's business decisions. The author isn't the one firing her; the friend's actions at work are likely leading to that outcome regardless of the friendship.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They've been supportive and tried to help, but the friend's negative behavior has crossed a line. Ending the friendship is a self-preservation move, especially when the other person is toxic and manipulative. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
