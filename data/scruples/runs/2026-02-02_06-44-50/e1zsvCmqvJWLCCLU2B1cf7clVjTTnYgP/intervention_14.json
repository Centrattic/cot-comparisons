I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (ITA) is in the wrong here. The situation involves a long-time friend who comes from a less privileged background. The author's family is well-off, and they've provided financial help to the friend, like buying her a car and letting her join family vacations. The friend now works at the author's family business and has been acting resentful, blaming the author for her work mistakes, and spreading negative things about the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has been supportive, offering a job and financial help. However, the friend's behavior has turned negative, with resentment and accusations. The friend is in a tough spot financially and maybe feels the author is using their privilege without understanding her struggles. The author is dealing with personal medical issues and depression, which might have affected their ability to support the friend as much as before.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's actions: spreading rumors, blaming the author, and pretending to be nice. The author is not necessarily at fault for the friend's reaction, but maybe there's something in how they handled the situation. The author tried to defend the friend at work, which is good, but the friend's resentment is causing problems. The author wants to cut the friendship, knowing it might lead to the friend losing her job if the parents stop supporting her.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The author isn't responsible for the friend's resentment. The friend's actions are her own choices. However, the author might be aware of the friend's struggles and could have tried to communicate better. But since the friend is acting out and the author is under stress themselves, ending the friendship seems a reasonable step to protect themselves. The friend's behavior is toxic, and the author has the right to set boundaries. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
