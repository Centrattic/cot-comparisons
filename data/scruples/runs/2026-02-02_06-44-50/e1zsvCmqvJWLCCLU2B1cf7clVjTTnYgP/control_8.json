I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user has presented a situation where their friend is turning on them, and they want to know if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The friend comes from a less privileged background, and the author's family has supported her with vacations, gifts, even a car. The friend has financial struggles, debt, and can't move out. The author offered her a place to stay but she declined due to her dog. The author works in the family business and has medical issues affecting their work. The friend works in the warehouse, is making mistakes, and now is blaming the author. She's spreading negative things about the author, and the author wants to cut ties, knowing their parents might fire her then.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe key points to consider are the friend's actions versus the author's. The author has supported the friend financially and socially. The friend, however, is acting out, making false accusations, and being resentful. The author is trying to defend her at work despite her mistakes, which might be hard on the author given their own medical issues. The friend's behavior is malicious, which could justify the author cutting ties. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the author's privilege. The friend feels jealous and angry about their different life situations. The author isn't doing anything wrong by being successful, and offering support when they could. The friend's reaction is more about her own struggles rather than the author's actions. \n\nThe author wants to stop being friends, which might hurt the friend, but given the friend's toxic behavior, it's a reasonable self-defense. The author isn't forcing the friendship; they're protecting themselves from a friend who is spreading lies. The potential consequence of the friend losing her job if the author stops supporting her is a factor, but the author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship that's harmful to them. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend's actions are the main issue here. The author has been supportive but the friend's actions are crossing boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
