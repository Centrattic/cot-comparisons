I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. They think the author might be, but they're curious about my take.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author comes from a wealthy background, their friend does not. The author's family has been generous, giving the friend vacations, gifts, even a car. The friend works in their family's business, initially taking a job in the warehouse. The author defends her at work despite her mistakes. The friend starts resenting the author, spreading negative things about them, and the author is considering cutting off the friendship, knowing it might lead to the friend losing her job and support.\n\nThe author is dealing with health issues and depression, which affects their work performance slightly. The friend accuses the author of being a spoiled attention-seeker and a leech, which is pretty harsh. The author feels the friend is jealous and fake.\n\nNow, considering the options: The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate if that's the case. The author has been supportive, even defending the friend at work despite her mistakes. The friend, on the other hand, is acting out with jealousy, spreading rumors, and not being genuine. The author is considering cutting ties, possibly knowing it will hurt the friend, but the friend's actions seem to have already damaged the relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by ending the friendship. The author has the right to end a friendship if someone is being toxic. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic. The author isn't necessarily at fault for the friend's jealousy or for defending her at work. The friend's resentment seems to stem from her own struggles and maybe the author's success, but that doesn't justify her actions. The author's decision to stop being friends is a response to the friend's behavior, not the cause of it. So the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
