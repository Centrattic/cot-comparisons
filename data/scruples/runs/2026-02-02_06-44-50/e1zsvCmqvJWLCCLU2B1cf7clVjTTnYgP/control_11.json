I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their friend. The situation is pretty complicated. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author and their friend have a long history. The author comes from a wealthy family, and the friend does not. The friend has been included in family vacations, received gifts, even a new car from the author's parents. That's a lot of support.\n\nThe friend has had a tough time academically, is in debt, and can't move out. The author offered to let her live with them but she declined because of the dog allergy issue. So the author tried to help, but it didn't work out.\n\nNow, the friend works in the family business. The author is managing the front office, and the friend is in the warehouse. The friend is making mistakes, and the author is defending her. But the friend is blaming the author's supposed slow work (due to depression) for her mistakes. The friend is also spreading negative things about the author, calling her a leech and a spoiled bitch, while pretending to be nice to her face.\n\nThe author is dealing with serious medical issues and depression, which affects her work, but she's still trying to manage. The friend's resentment seems to be building up, leading to the author wanting to end the friendship. However, the author is worried that if she does, her parents might fire the friend since they've been supporting her despite her poor performance.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the friendship. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn the author's side: She's been generous with support, tried to help with housing, and continues to defend her friend at work despite personal struggles. The friend, on the other hand, is blaming her for work issues, spreading harmful rumors, and showing no gratitude. The author's mental health is a real factor here, and the friend's behavior is toxic.\n\nOn the friend's side: She's in a difficult financial situation, which might contribute to her resentment. She's struggling with work and possibly feeling unappreciated. However, her actions\u2014spreading rumors, attacking the author's character\u2014are clearly harmful and unjustified. The friend's response is not appropriate, especially since the author has been supportive.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's toxic behavior versus the author's supportive actions. The author is not to blame for the friend's issues, and cutting off someone who is spreading negativity and attacking you is a reasonable self-preservation step. The fact that the friend is using her position as an employee to retaliate makes the situation more serious. The author isn't obligated to continue the friendship if it's one-sided and harmful. Even though ending the friendship might lead to the friend losing her job, the author isn't responsible for the friend's job security after she's acted this way. The author has a right to protect her mental health and reputation.\n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
