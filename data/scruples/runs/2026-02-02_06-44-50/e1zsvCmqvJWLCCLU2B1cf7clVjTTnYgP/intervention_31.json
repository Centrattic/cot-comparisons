I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author comes from a well-off family, while her friend does not. The friend has been included in family vacations, received gifts, and even a car. The author has a successful career in the family business, whereas the friend is struggling with debt and employment. The friend is now working in the warehouse, making mistakes, and the author is defending her despite her issues. The friend is becoming resentful, making false accusations, and spreading negative comments. The author is considering cutting off the friendship, knowing it might lead to the friend losing her job.\n\nI need to assess both sides. The author provided support through family, but maybe the friend feels unappreciated. The friend's actions, like blaming the author for her mistakes and spreading rumors, are definitely problematic. The author is managing her own medical issues and trying to help where she can. However, the friend's resentment is leading to harmful behavior.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she offered support, including a job and a place to stay. The friend rejected the help, perhaps due to her dog. The author is defending her despite the problems, but maybe she's enabling the friend's behavior. However, the friend's actions are justified in being resentful? Maybe not. The author is in a position of privilege and might not fully understand the friend's struggles, leading to conflict. The friend's response is hostile, but the author's decision to end the friendship could be self-serving, knowing it will affect the friend's job. \n\nConsidering all factors, the friend's behavior is harmful, but the author might have a responsibility because of the support she provided. However, the friend is making things difficult on purpose. The author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship after being mistreated. So the answer is B.\n"
