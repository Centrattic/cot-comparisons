I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through their situation again.\n\nThe author and their friend have been close for a long time. The author comes from a wealthy family and has had a lot of advantages\u2014scholarships, family buying their friend a car, etc. The friend, on the other hand, isn't as well-off, has student debt, and is still living with her parents. The author offered her a job in the family business, which paid well, but now there's tension. The friend is making mistakes at work, blaming the author's slow work (due to medical issues) for her errors, and spreading negative things about the author behind their back. The author is now considering cutting off the friendship, knowing that if they do, their parents might fire the friend because she's an underperforming employee. The question is whether the author is at fault for ending the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The author has been supportive by offering the job, providing family vacations, gifts, and even a place to live (which the friend declined). The author is also defending the friend at work despite her mistakes. The friend, however, is making errors, spreading rumors, and acting resentful. She's also been unkind to the author's boyfriend and is pretending to be nice to their face.\n\nThe author is dealing with medical issues and depression, which affect their work performance slightly. The friend is blaming the author for her mistakes, which seems unfair because the delay is minimal. The author is considering cutting off the friend, which would leave her without the job and possibly lose the support from the author's family.\n\nNow, considering the moral aspects. The author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship with someone who is spreading lies and acting resentful. The friend's behavior seems toxic\u2014backstabbing, blaming others, and being unkind. The author has done a lot to support the friend, but support doesn't mean enduring mistreatment. It's reasonable for the author to distance themselves from someone who is acting this way, especially after multiple issues over time. The fact that the author is aware the friend might lose her job if they cut ties doesn't make the author responsible for her job security; that's the employer's responsibility, not the personal friendship's. The author isn't forcing the parents to keep her employed; they're just aware that their parents might let her go if the friendship ends. The friend's actions are causing the rift, not the author's.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship. The friend's behavior is the main issue here. The author's decision is a response to the friend's toxicity, not the cause of it. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
