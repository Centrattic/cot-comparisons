I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author and their friend have been close for a long time. The author comes from a wealthy family and has had an easier life, graduating debt-free and moving out early. The friend has had more struggles, is in debt, and still lives with her parents. The author helped her by offering a job in their family business, which she accepted. However, their friendship has deteriorated. The friend now resents the author, accuses them of being spoiled and seeking attention, and talks negatively about them behind their back. The author is considering cutting off the friendship, knowing that it might lead to her losing the job and support. The question is if the author is at fault.\n\nSo, let's break it down. The author has supported the friend financially in the past\u2014vacations, gifts, a car. Then offered a job that paid well. The friend's behavior has become toxic, making false accusations, spreading rumors, and being unkind. The author is now considering cutting ties because of the friend's actions, even though it might impact her job.\n\nOn one hand, the author did help the friend a lot. But the friend's response is hostile and ungrateful. The author has a right to distance themselves from someone who is spreading lies and being resentful. The friend's actions seem to be more unkind; she's using her position as an employee to make things harder and is undermining the author. The author's decision to stop being friends might be a self-preservation choice, especially if the friend is causing stress and working poorly. However, the author might feel guilty because they were generous. But the friend's behavior is clearly toxic. The key here is that the friend's actions have crossed a line, and the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to end the friendship despite the consequences. The author isn't obligated to keep being friends with someone who treats them poorly.\n"
