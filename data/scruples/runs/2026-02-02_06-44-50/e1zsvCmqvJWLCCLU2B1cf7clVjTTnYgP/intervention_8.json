I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is between them and their friend. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author comes from a well-off family, and the friend does not. They've been friends for a long time, and the author has given the friend lots of gifts, even bought her a car. The author graduated debt-free because of family money, moved out at 18, and now works in their family business. The friend, on the other hand, is in debt, struggles with school, still lives at home at 26, and works in the warehouse at the family business. \n\nThe friend has started acting resentful, blaming the author for her mistakes at work, spreading rumors that the author is faking depression, and trash-talking to their mutual boyfriend. The author is tired of the friend's attitude and wants to cut ties, but they know that without their support, the friend might lose her job. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the friendship.\n\nHmm. So the author is in a privileged position, but they've tried to help the friend by offering a job, housing, etc. The friend is now angry and spreading negative things. The author is ending the friendship because of the friend's behavior, not because of their financial status. But the friend's resentment might stem from feeling that the author has advantages she doesn't have. \n\nThe friend's actions\u2014gossiping, blaming the author for her work mistakes, and spreading lies\u2014seem like clear wrongdoings. The author is responding to being treated poorly. The author tried to defend the friend at work, even though the friend wasn't performing well. The author has medical issues, which the friend ignores or mischaracterizes. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is at fault for ending the friendship. The friend's behavior is toxic, and the author has a right to distance themselves. The author isn't cutting off the friend out of spite but because the friend is being abusive. Even though the author is in a position of privilege, the friend's actions justify the breaking of the friendship. The author isn't responsible for the friend's financial struggles beyond the help they've already provided. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B\u2014the author is not in the wrong. They're protecting themselves from a toxic relationship and the friend's bad behavior. The friend's issues are her own, and the author has done what they can to support her. Ending the friendship in this case is a reasonable response.\n"
