I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is between the author and their friend. They've been friends for a long time, but now things are falling apart. The friend seems resentful, and the author is questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author comes from a well-off family, and their friend isn't as fortunate. The friend gets gifts, family vacations, even a car from the author's parents. The author mentions that they've had an easier life\u2014school was easy, no debt, moved out at 18. The friend has over $50k in debt, struggles with jobs, and is still living with her parents. The author offered her a room but she declined because of her dog. \n\nThe friend is now working in the family business, which the author manages. She's making mistakes, and the author defends her. However, the friend blames the author for her mistakes, saying the author isn't providing orders quickly enough. The author is dealing with medical issues and depression, which might be affecting their work speed a bit. The friend starts spreading rumors, calling the author spoiled and even telling the boyfriend to break up with her. The author is considering cutting off the friendship, knowing that if they do, their parents might let her go due to her poor performance, which could hurt the friend even more.\n\nSo, the key points here are the friend's resentment and betrayal. The author has done a lot for her, but the friend is acting out of spite. The author is in a vulnerable position with health issues and is trying to support her despite her mistakes. The friend, on the other hand, is making false accusations and spreading negativity. \n\nThe author is now thinking of ending the friendship, but they're worried about the consequences for the friend. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the friendship given the friend's behavior. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't the one making things worse. They've tried to be supportive, even defending the friend at work. The friend's actions seem to be driven by jealousy and resentment. The author's intention to end the friendship isn't malicious\u2014it's because the friend is being toxic and spreading lies. The author has every right to cut off someone who is being harmful and disloyal. Also, considering the friend's possible motivations (jealousy of the author's privileges), it's understandable why the author would want to end the friendship. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong here. The friend's actions are the main issue. The answer should be B.\n"
