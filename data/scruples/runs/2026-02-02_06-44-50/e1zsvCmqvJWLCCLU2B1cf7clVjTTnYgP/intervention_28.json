I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is between two friends where one is from a wealthier background and the other is struggling. The friend who's struggling has been resentful and started spreading rumors, while the author is dealing with their own medical issues and work responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has been giving their friend opportunities\u2014family vacations, gifts, a job. They've even offered a place to stay but were turned down. The friend, on the other hand, is in debt, has a hard time finding a good job, and now works in the warehouse. The friend is making mistakes at work and blaming the author for slowing things down. Also, the friend is spreading negative things about the author behind their back.\n\nThe author is dealing with depression and medical issues, which affects their work performance slightly. They're trying to support their friend despite the friend's resentfulness. The author is now considering cutting off the friendship, knowing that their parents might then let the friend go from the job because of the errors.\n\nSo the question is: is the author wrong for cutting off the friendship? Well, the friend's actions are pretty toxic. Spreading rumors, blaming the author for their mistakes, being resentful. The author has done a lot to support them. The friend's behavior is harmful, and the author is justified in feeling used or taken advantage of. Also, the author is dealing with their own health issues, which adds to the stress.\n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it differently? Like setting boundaries earlier or addressing the friend's resentment. However, given the friend's actions, it's understandable that the author would want to end the friendship. The key here is that the friend's behavior is the main issue. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to stop being friends when the other person is being hostile and spreading falsehoods. So the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
