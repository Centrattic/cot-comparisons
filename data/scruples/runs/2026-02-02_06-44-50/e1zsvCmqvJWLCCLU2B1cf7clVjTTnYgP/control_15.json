I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nSo, the author and their friend have been close for a long time. The author comes from a wealthy family, and their friend doesn't. The friend has been included in family vacations, received gifts, and even a new car. The author managed to graduate without debt because their great-grandpa paid for school, while the friend has over $50k in debt. The friend is still living with her parents, and when she wanted to move out, the author offered a room but she declined because of her dog and the author's allergies.\n\nNow, the author works in the family business. The friend was given a job in the warehouse, which pays better than what they were looking for. Since she started there, their friendship has deteriorated. The author is dealing with medical issues and depression, so they haven't been as active. The friend has been making mistakes at work, and the author defends her. The friend is now blaming the author for her mistakes, even though the author's delays are minimal. The friend has spread negative things about the author behind their back, called the author a leech, etc. The author wants to end the friendship but is worried that doing so might lead to the friend being fired since the parents might no longer support her.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong if they stop being friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The friend has been given a lot of support from the author's family, which might have created a dependency. The friend's resentment might stem from feeling that the author has it too easy, and when things go wrong at work, she lashes out. The author, on the other hand, is dealing with their own issues and is trying to manage both their health and supporting the friend. The friend's behavior is clearly toxic\u2014backbiting, spreading rumors, being hostile. The author is considering cutting her off, which is understandable if the friend is being abusive.\n\nBut the author also needs to consider the friend's position. The friend might feel that the support from the author's family was conditional on the friendship. If the friendship ends, the family might stop supporting her job, leading to her being fired. The author might be indirectly causing her harm by ending the friendship, but the friend's actions were first. The author has a right to protect themselves from toxic behavior.\n\nIn terms of the friend's actions, she's definitely in the wrong for the way she's spoken about the author. The author has been generous, offering support (like the room) and defending her at work. The friend's resentment is misplaced and harmful. The author's decision to end the friendship is a response to being treated poorly, which isn't something they deserve.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I don't think so. They have the right to end a friendship that's causing them emotional distress, especially when the other person is being malicious. The friend's actions are the root problem here, not the author's decision to end the relationship. The author's generosity doesn't obligate them to accept being insulted and lied about. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
