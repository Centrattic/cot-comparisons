I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to end their friendship with a coworker, given the circumstances.\n\nFirst, the friend's perspective: she's been friends with the author for a long time, comes from a less privileged background, and has been included in family vacations and even received a car. The author's family is wealthy, and she's in a better position financially and academically. The friend is now an employee in the family business, working in the warehouse, which she wasn't suited for, and she's making mistakes. The author is defending her despite her issues, but the friend is now being resentful, spreading negativity, and making false accusations. She's even insulted the author's boyfriend and pretended to be nice to her face. \n\nThe author is dealing with personal and medical issues, which are affecting her work performance slightly, but not enough to impact the friend's tasks. The friend is blaming the author for her mistakes. The author feels done with the friendship because of the friend's attitude and knows that cutting ties would lead to her being fired, which is a concern.\n\nSo, the main points here: the friend is acting out of jealousy, has a bad attitude, is toxic in the work environment, and is a poor performer. The author is trying to be supportive but has limits. Ending the friendship to protect herself from the toxic behavior isn't inherently wrong. However, the friend might feel betrayed, especially since she's been treated well in the past. The author is also aware that her decision could lead to the friend losing her job, but that's a consequence of the friend's actions, not necessarily the author's fault. \n\nThe key issue is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting ties. The friend's behavior is clearly harmful, and the author is justified in protecting her own well-being. The friend's resentment might stem from her own insecurities and inability to handle the situation. The author isn't the one acting wrong here; she's responding to the friend's actions. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
