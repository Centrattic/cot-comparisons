I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is asking for a judgment on whether the person who wrote the situation (the author) is at fault. The options are A (yes, they're in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author and a friend have been close for a long time. The author is from a wealthy family, and the friend is not. The author's parents have given the friend various gifts, including a car, and even offered her a job in their family business. The friend, however, has struggled with school, has debt, and can't move out of her parents' house. \n\nThe author moved out at 18, while the friend is still living with her parents at 26. The friend has a dog that the author is allergic to, so when the author offered her a room to live in, the friend declined. Now, the friend works in the warehouse of the family business and is making mistakes. The author, who has health and depression issues, has tried to defend the friend but has become less active as a friend. \n\nThe friend is now being resentful, blaming the author for her job issues, and spreading negative things about the author to others. The author is considering cutting off the friendship, knowing that without their support, the friend might lose her job. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. \n\nOn the author's side: They've provided support (gifts, job) to the friend. They've tried to be a good friend despite their own health issues. They're defending the friend at work because they know her intentions are good. The friend, on the other hand, is spreading malicious rumors, being resentful, and pretending to be nice to the author's face. The author is ending the friendship because of the friend's toxic behavior.\n\nOn the friend's side: She's struggling financially and emotionally. Her resentment might stem from feeling jealous or neglected. She's making mistakes at work and taking it out on the author. However, her actions of spreading negative things and being fake are definitely hurtful and inappropriate.\n\nThe author is considering ending the friendship, which is their right. The fact that cutting off might lead to her losing the job is a consequence, but the author isn't responsible for that if the friend's behavior is toxic. The author has given her chances and support. The friend's actions seem to be the main issue here.\n\nSo, in terms of fault, who's at fault? The author tried to help and support, but the friend's actions are the problem. The author isn't wrong for ending the friendship. They have a right to protect their mental health, especially given their medical issues. The friend's behavior is clearly inappropriate, so the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
