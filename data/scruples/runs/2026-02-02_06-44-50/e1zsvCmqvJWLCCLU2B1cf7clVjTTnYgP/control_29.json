I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a long-time friend who's been given a lot of support, but now there's a falling out because of work issues and personal resentment.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author comes from a wealthy family, their friend doesn't. The friend has been part of their family vacations and even got a car from the author's parents. The author mentions they've been offered a job in the family business, which the friend accepted. But now, the friend is making mistakes at work and blaming the author, who is dealing with medical issues and depression.\n\nThe friend is spreading negative things about the author to others, being nice to their face but mean behind their back. The author wants to end the friendship but is concerned about the repercussions for the friend, especially since their parents might fire her if they stop supporting her.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author has done a lot to support the friend, including offering a place to live, which the friend declined. The author is trying to defend the friend's work mistakes despite their own health issues. The friend, on the other hand, is not only underperforming but also being toxic, spreading rumors, and being resentful.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the friendship. Well, the author isn't obligated to be friends with someone who is being abusive and spreading lies. The friend's actions seem to be driven by jealousy and resentment, which is not the author's fault. The author has been supportive, but the friend is turning that support into something negative. \n\nAlso, the author's decision might be influenced by the knowledge that their parents might let the friend go if the friendship ends. However, the author is not directly responsible for the friend's job status. The friend's position is due to her own performance issues, not just the author's actions. The author is also dealing with their own health issues, which adds to their stress.\n\nIn conclusion, the friend's behavior is toxic and the author is justified in wanting to distance themselves. The author isn't in the wrong for ending a friendship where the other person is being harmful and ungrateful. The answer should be B (No).\n"
