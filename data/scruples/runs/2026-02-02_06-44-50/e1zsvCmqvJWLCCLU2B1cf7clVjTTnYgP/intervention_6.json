I come from a pretty well off family, she does not. However, she's like a sister to me. She comes on all family vacations, gets all kinds of gifts, my parents even bought her a new car.\n\nMy life has been significantly easier than hers. School came easy to me, and I graduated without any debt- my great-grandpa paid for school as long as I maintained a 3.8GPA. I moved out at 18, whereas she still lives with her parents at 26\n\nShe's always struggled in classroom settings. She's over $50k in debt. Her parents want her to move out, but she can't afford it. I offered to clear out a room in my place so she could live with me paying whatever she could, but she turned me down (she has a dog that I'm very allergic to, and she won't leave him with her parents).\n\nNow, I work for the family business that has been passed down 4 generations. I run the front office, managing customers, contracts, etc. When she graduated she couldn't find a well paying job anywhere  My parents offered her a job working for them in their warehouse, paying twice what they were looking to hire someone for. She accepted, and since she started working here, our relationship has fallen apart.\n\nI've been going through some serious personal and medical issues and have depression - I haven't been the most active friend, but I'm doing my best. We stopped hanging out on the weekends, only talking and catching up at work. \n\nAt work she makes a lot of mistakes, and my parents get frustrated with her. I always try to come to her defense because her intentions are good. She wants to quit working in the warehouse and get an office job, but she's angered every customer she's spoken to, and there are no current openings. She's starting to blame her mistakes on me not giving her orders quick enough.  I have slowed down on getting orders entered in due to said medical condition, but it's only ever an extra 30 minutes or so. It's never long enough to impact what she does.\n\nShe has started to get very resentful of me. She told my parents that I'm not depressed, I'm just an attention-seeker because I have nothing to be sad about. She told my boyfriend that I was a life-sucking leech and he should break up with me because I'm spoiled and will ruin his life. She has been trash talking me to everyone we know. The only reason I know this is because everyone keeps confronting me over how much of a bitch I've become. All this while she pretends to be nice to my face.\n\nAt this point I no longer want to be friends with her.  I know that I'm in a very fortunate position compared to her, but with her attitude I'm just done with her. I know that if I stop being her friend, my parents will not support her the same way they have been - she'll just be an employee who makes a lot of costly errors and owes them a lot of money, and will probably be fired in weeks. Knowing that, AITA if I stop being her friend anyway?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The main issue is a friendship that's deteriorating because of financial disparities and work-related conflicts.\n\nFirst, the author comes from a wealthy family, while their friend is struggling financially. The author has provided support like family vacations, gifts, and even a car. The friend has debt, can't move out, and turned down the author's offer to live with her due to her dog. The author works in the family business and has a medical condition affecting their work performance. The friend, working in the warehouse, is making mistakes and blaming the author, leading to resentment and public criticism.\n\nThe author is considering cutting off the friend, knowing that their parents might fire her if they stop supporting her. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nThe author's perspective: They've been supportive, but the friend's behavior is toxic. The friend is blaming the author for her mistakes, spreading negativity, and the author can't handle the stress anymore. The friend's actions might be driven by jealousy or frustration from her own circumstances.\n\nThe friend's perspective: She's struggling financially, feels unsupported, and might perceive the author's wealth as a reason for their differing circumstances. Her resentment could stem from feeling overwhelmed at work and personal issues.\n\nIs the author at fault for ending the friendship? The author has a right to distance themselves from someone who is toxic and spreading harmful rumors. However, the author might also be neglecting the friend's struggles. The friend's actions are clearly harmful, but the author's decision to stop being friends could have consequences for her job and well-being.\n\nThe key points are mutual respect and responsibility. The author tried to help by offering a job and support, but the friend's response was negative. The author's medical issues are valid, and they're doing their best despite that. The friend's public criticism and lack of accountability are problematic.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for cutting off a toxic friendship. They've supported the friend but can't continue being in a relationship that's harmful to their mental health. The friend's actions justify the author's decision, even if it affects her job. The author isn't responsible for the friend's choices and the consequences that follow.\n"
