She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he started keeping an \"Almanac\" of notes about his wife's preferences and things she told him, just so he could remember and do sweet things for her. Now she's upset with him, feeling betrayed, and thinks it's a \"playbook\" that cheapens their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's intention was to remember things and show his love by keeping track, which he did in a personal way. He didn't share it with anyone else. On the other hand, his wife feels that having a written record makes it seem like he's just following a script rather than genuinely remembering or caring. She might feel that it's manipulative or insincere, which is why she's hurt.\n\nWhy would someone feel that way? Maybe she expects spontaneity and genuine memory without needing notes. If he's relying on the Almanac, she might think he can't remember on his own, which could be a blow to her confidence that he truly cares. Also, the term \"playbook\" suggests she sees it as a strategy to impress her, rather than a heartfelt gesture. The betrayal might come from the fact that he kept it secret, even though it was a private collection of notes. Maybe she didn't know he was keeping track, and the secrecy made her feel like he was hiding something or manipulating their relationship.\n\nBut the author's intention was good. He wanted to remember things to be a better partner. However, intentions don't always align with the effect on the other person. Communication might have been an issue here. If he had explained the Almanac to her before, she might have a different view. Since he didn't, and now she's hurt, maybe he should have considered her feelings about how he's remembering things. It's possible that even though he meant well, the action caused harm, so he is at least partially responsible.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe she's overreacting. Keeping notes is a common way for people to remember things, especially in relationships. If she knew about it, she might have appreciated the effort more. The fact that she was surprised suggests that maybe he didn't communicate his reasons clearly. But is it his fault for keeping a personal notebook? It's a personal choice to document things, but in the context of a relationship, transparency is important. If she didn't know about it and felt betrayed upon discovering it, maybe he should have discussed it with her earlier.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's intention was to show love and care through remembering details, which is a positive thing. However, the wife felt it was inauthentic and manipulative, leading to her feeling betrayed. The lack of communication about the Almanac's purpose might have contributed to her negative reaction. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for keeping the notebook without discussing it, leading to hurt feelings despite good intentions.\n\nI think it's a bit of both. The author isn't in the wrong in terms of having a good intention, but he might be in the wrong for not considering his wife's feelings about privacy and authenticity in their relationship. Since relationships require communication and mutual understanding, keeping a secret notebook that's so personal might not be the best approach, even if the intent is good. So, he might be partially at fault for not discussing it with her, which led to her feeling hurt. But the wife's reaction could also be excessive, depending on her perspective on privacy and how she values genuine memory versus documented reminders. However, given that the question is whether he's in the wrong, and considering the wife's feelings, the answer might lean towards him not being in the wrong because his intention was positive and the action wasn't malicious. But the way it was handled, without communication, might be the issue. Hmm, this is a tough one. Maybe the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he had good intentions and the action wasn't inherently wrong, even if it caused hurt. Alternatively, maybe A (Yes) because the lack of communication and her feeling betrayed suggests he should have considered her perspective more.\n"
