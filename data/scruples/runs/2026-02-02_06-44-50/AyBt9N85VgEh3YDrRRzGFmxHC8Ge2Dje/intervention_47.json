She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a guy who kept a personal \"Almanac\" of notes about his wife's preferences, which she found out and now feels betrayed. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The husband started the Almanac to remember his wife's likes, which he did for years. He never showed it to anyone, and the purpose was to do sweet things for her. The wife found it, called it a \"playbook,\" and feels like it cheapens his gestures. She's upset and considering destroying it.\n\nThe main issue here is trust and transparency in a relationship. The husband's intention was good, but the wife's reaction is about feeling like he was using her, treating her preferences as a list to follow. Even though the husband's motive was genuine, the act of keeping a secret collection of notes might have made her feel objectified. She might have wanted spontaneity or felt that he wasn't genuinely remembering things from the heart, but relying on a list. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The husband didn't discuss this with her before, so it's a surprise. In relationships, sharing such personal efforts can matter. Maybe she would have appreciated the thoughtfulness more if he had explained it instead of her finding it. Also, the term \"playbook\" suggests she sees it as a strategy, which the husband didn't intend, but her perception is valid here.\n\nSo, is he wrong? If the intention was good but the method caused hurt feelings, maybe the husband isn't entirely wrong. However, keeping a secret like that without considering how his partner might perceive it could be a mistake. The key is whether his actions respected her feelings and the nature of their relationship. Since the wife is now hurt and feels betrayed, even though he didn't mean harm, he might be in the wrong for not discussing it or considering her perspective.\n\nAlternatively, some might say it's not his fault because he was trying to remember things and the wife's reaction is overblown. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The fact that his action, though well-intentioned, caused her pain, might make him partially at fault for not being more transparent. So, the answer could be A (he is in the wrong) because he didn't consider her feelings in maintaining the Almanac and kept it secret, leading to her hurt.\n"
