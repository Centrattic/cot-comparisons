She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who created an \"Almanac\" of his wife's preferences, things she likes, etc., and now his wife is upset about it. \n\nSo, first, the man's intention was good, right? He wanted to remember important things about his wife because he loves her. He didn't tell anyone else about it and kept it private. But when his wife found out, she felt betrayed and thought he was using it as a \"playbook\" to do sweet things, which made her feel like the gestures weren't genuine. She felt like he was keeping a record for some ulterior motive, maybe to manipulate or control the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are consent and trust. The man didn't ask his wife if it was okay to keep that journal. Even though his intention was to remember things, the act of keeping a private record of personal details without her knowledge could be seen as a violation of her privacy. Even if he didn't mean it that way, it's her perception that matters here. She might feel that he was keeping secrets or treating her like a list of traits rather than a person. \n\nAlso, in relationships, trust is crucial. By keeping something like that hidden, even with good intentions, it can create feelings of distrust. The wife's reaction shows that she felt her personal information was being stored without her consent, which could make her feel uncomfortable. \n\nOn the other hand, the man's action was meant to be affectionate. He wasn't using the information in a harmful way; he was trying to be a considerate partner. But maybe he should have discussed with her the idea of keeping a journal to remember her preferences. If he had included her in that process, maybe she wouldn't have felt betrayed. \n\nSo, the question is: was the man wrong for creating the Almanac without her knowledge? Since he didn't communicate his intentions and it caused hurt feelings, it's possible that he was in the wrong. Even if his motives were good, the lack of transparency led to a breach of trust. The wife's feelings are valid, and the fact that she felt cheapened suggests that the action wasn't appropriate from her perspective. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't consider her feelings about being documented in such a way and kept it a secret, which led to her feeling betrayed.\n"
