She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an almanac with notes about his wife. The situation is that he wrote down things like her favorite colors, restaurants, etc., to remember and do sweet things for her. But now his wife feels betrayed, seeing it as a \"playbook,\" and she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was good\u2014he wanted to remember important details about his wife because he cares. He didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. On the other hand, the wife felt that having this notebook made her feel like he was just using a list to play along, which cheapened his gestures. She might have felt that genuine love should be spontaneous without needing notes, or maybe she thought it was an invasion of her privacy, even though he meant well.\n\nThe key points here are intentions versus the impact. The author didn't do it with bad intent, but the wife's reaction shows that the impact was hurtful. Sometimes even well-meaning actions can cause unintended harm. The question is whether the author should have considered that keeping such a detailed notebook could make his wife feel uneasy. Maybe he should have discussed it with her earlier instead of keeping it a secret. However, the wife's reaction might also stem from her own feelings or insecurities. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. If she had known about the almanac earlier and given her perspective, maybe things would have been different. But since she found out like this, she might feel that he didn't involve her or that he was keeping secrets. The author's actions, while thoughtful, might have crossed a line by making her feel like her personal preferences were being cataloged for future use rather than genuine connection.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. His intentions were good, but the outcome was negative. In terms of accountability, maybe he's not entirely wrong because he had good intentions, but perhaps he could have been more considerate about how she might perceive it. However, it's also possible that the wife's reaction is overreacting given the context. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the wife is hurting, the answer might lean towards AITA (Am I the Asshole) meaning he is the asshole. But the options here are A for yes (author wrong) and B for no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe he's not wrong because he had good intentions. But the impact is what matters in these situations. If someone's action causes harm, they might be at fault even if intentions were good. So maybe A is the answer. But I'm a bit conflicted here. The answer could be A (yes, he's wrong) because the effect was negative even if unintended. Or B (no) because the intention was to show love and care. \n\nBut in the context of AITA questions, often if the person did something that caused harm unintentionally but could have been avoided, they might still be considered the asshole if the other person is hurt. So maybe the answer is A. However, some might argue that it's not his fault because he had good intentions. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: The wife might have felt that keeping such a private notebook without her knowledge was a breach of trust, even if it was for a good reason. So in that case, he's in the wrong for not discussing it with her. Therefore, A would be the answer. But if the answer is about whether he's in the wrong for having the almanac itself, and not for not discussing it, then maybe B. But since the wife's reaction is about betrayal and feeling used, the author might be in the wrong because the method he used (keeping a hidden list) led to her feeling that way. So I think A is the answer here.\n"
