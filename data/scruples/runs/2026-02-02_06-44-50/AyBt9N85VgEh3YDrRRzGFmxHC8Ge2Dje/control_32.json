She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he created this Almanac with all these notes about his wife's preferences and things she mentioned. He did this to remember important stuff so he could do sweet things for her. But when she found out, she was upset and felt betrayed, calling it a \"playbook\" and saying it cheapened the gestures.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about intention versus perception. The author's intention was to remember things to show his love and care. But his wife perceived it as insincere or manipulative. So, is he wrong? Well, maybe he didn't consider how she might feel about being documented. Even though his motives are good, actions can have unintended consequences. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he didn't discuss this with her before, she might feel like he's keeping secrets or treating her like a project. The fact that she said she always thought he remembered things naturally and that the notes made her feel like he was using a playbook suggests she values genuine presence over prepared gestures. \n\nHe might have crossed a line by keeping all these notes without her knowledge. Even if it's meant to be loving, it's possible that she values spontaneity and natural remembrance more than a written list. So, maybe he is in the wrong because he didn't consider her feelings about this method of remembering things. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's now considering destroying it shows how hurt she is. The author's actions, while well-intentioned, might have made her feel objectified or that her partner isn't truly present. So, even though he meant well, the action itself might be inappropriate in her eyes. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't consider her perspective and the method he chose caused her discomfort, despite his good intentions.\n"
