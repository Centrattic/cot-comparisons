She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for keeping an almanac of personal notes about his wife. The key points here are about privacy and trust.\n\nThe husband started writing down details about his wife's preferences as a way to remember them and do sweet things for her. He didn't share it with anyone, considering it a personal collection. However, his wife found it and felt betrayed, seeing it as a \"playbook\" instead of a genuine gesture. She now feels that all his sweet actions were just from the notes, which cheapened them for her.\n\nFrom the husband's perspective, he did this out of love and to avoid forgetting important details. He didn't intend to use it to manipulate or control; it was a tool for remembering. But the wife's reaction is valid because she feels like her personal details are being stored without her consent. The issue here is about privacy. Even if the intention was good, storing personal information about someone without their knowledge can be seen as invasive. \n\nIn a relationship, trust is crucial. The wife might feel that her private preferences were collected and cataloged without her approval. Even though the husband used this to do nice things, the act of keeping such a detailed record without discussing it can be perceived as a breach of trust. The wife's feeling of betrayal is important here. The husband's actions, while well-meaning, might have crossed a line by not respecting her autonomy in sharing her personal information. \n\nSo, even though the intention was good, the method of keeping a private almanac without her knowledge could be considered wrong because it's about respecting her privacy and how she feels about her personal information being stored. The husband should have discussed this with her to ensure she was comfortable with it.\n"
