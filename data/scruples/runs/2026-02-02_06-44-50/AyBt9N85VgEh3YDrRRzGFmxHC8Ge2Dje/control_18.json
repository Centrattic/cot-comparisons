She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Almanac is in the wrong. The story is about a guy who created a notebook with all his wife's favorite things and personal details, which he uses to remember them and do sweet things for her. But when she found out, she was upset and felt betrayed, seeing it as a \"playbook\" instead of a genuine gesture.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about the intention vs. the perception. The author's intention was to show love and remember important things about his wife. He didn't keep it secret for any manipulative reason but just to have a personal reference. However, the wife felt like he was using a playbook, which cheapened their relationship. That's a big emotional response.\n\nI need to consider if keeping such a notebook is inherently wrong. Well, the content itself is all about remembering her preferences, which is a good thing. The issue seems to be that she didn't know about it and felt it was insincere. Maybe she felt like he wasn't being genuine in his remembrance, that he was just going through a list instead of truly caring. Or maybe she felt like he was keeping a secret that should have been shared.\n\nBut why would she feel that way? People have different comfort levels with privacy and how they perceive effort. The husband's approach was to document to avoid forgetting, which is a valid strategy. However, in relationships, sometimes the method matters. If she felt that the acts of remembering were mechanical because he was following a list, it might have made her feel like the gestures weren't heartfelt. That's a common issue where people expect spontaneous acts of love rather than planned ones, even if the intent is good.\n\nAnother angle: he didn't mention the Almanac to her before. Maybe she would have appreciated knowing he took such effort. But he kept it as a personal tool, which she might see as hiding something. However, he didn't use it in a manipulative way, just as notes for himself.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's tricky. His intention wasn't to hurt or manipulate. He did it out of love. But the outcome was her feeling betrayed. The problem might be more about communication. He didn't realize that keeping it a secret could make her feel like he wasn't being genuine. Maybe if he had shared his approach with her, she would have understood. But since he didn't, she took it as a betrayal. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the question is whether the act of creating the Almanac was wrong. Since there's no malicious intent, maybe he isn't in the wrong. But the fact that it made her feel betrayed might mean that he didn't consider her feelings enough, which is a communication issue rather than a moral wrong. So the answer might be B (No), but I need to be careful here. Alternatively, maybe he is in the wrong because he kept a personal tool that could be seen as undermining the authenticity of his gestures, even unintentionally. But I think the intention is key here. Since he didn't mean to hurt her, but his action did, it's more about perspective. \n\nIn relationships, sometimes the expectations differ. If she wanted him to remember without needing notes, but he uses notes, maybe he's not doing it the way she hoped. However, that doesn't make him wrong for needing to take notes. People have different ways of showing love. So in the end, the answer might be B (No), he's not in the wrong because his intentions were good, even if the outcome was unintended.\n"
