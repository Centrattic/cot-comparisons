She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the person is asking if they're in the wrong for keeping an \"Almanac,\" which is a notebook where they jot down personal details about their wife. The wife found out and is upset, feeling like it's a playbook and that she's being treated like a game. The user wants to know if they're at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's intention was to remember important things about their wife because they care. They didn't tell anyone about the notebook and kept it private. But the wife felt betrayed and thinks it cheapens the sweet gestures. She might feel like her personal details are being used in a transactional way, even if that's not the case.\n\nNow, why would the wife feel this way? Maybe she values spontaneity and genuine memory over something that's written down. She might see the notebook as manipulative or insincere, like he's just following a script. Even if the intent is good, the perception matters here. Trust is a big part of relationships, and if she feels like he's keeping a list to \"play\" the perfect husband, that could hurt her feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't doing it for show. They mention wanting to avoid being the guy who forgets important things. They use the notes to remember her preferences to make her happy. It's a way to stay connected and thoughtful. The fact that they kept it private and only shared it because she found it suggests they didn't think it was a problem before.\n\nBut the key issue here is consent and transparency. The author didn't discuss the notebook with his wife, even though it contains personal information about her. Even if it's not meant to be a secret, keeping such a thing hidden might make her feel like her personal details are being kept without her knowledge. It's possible she values her privacy more in certain aspects, and the existence of the notebook, even with good intentions, invades that space.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. The wife is upset and feels betrayed, which indicates that the action, though well-intentioned, caused emotional harm. The author might not have realized that keeping a personal notebook could be seen as a breach of trust, even if it's not malicious.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's actions were wrong. The answer depends on whether the method of remembering these details in a hidden notebook crossed a line. If the intention was purely to care and remember, but it made the wife feel used or objectified, then the author might be in the wrong. The fact that the wife's reaction is about feeling that her gestures are cheapened suggests that the method (a written playbook) is problematic for her.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't discuss this with his wife, so he didn't consider her perspective. Even if he saw it as a way to show love, the lack of communication might have led to misunderstanding. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not considering how she would perceive it and for not being transparent about his actions.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because keeping such a notebook without discussing it with his wife led to her feeling betrayed, and the method of using a written \"playbook\" may have undermined the sincerity she expected in his gestures.\n"
