She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about this guy who created an \"Almanac\" with notes about his wife's preferences, things she mentioned, etc. He's been using it to remember stuff so he can do sweet things for her. But when she found it, she got upset, called it a \"playbook,\" felt betrayed, and now he's wondering if he did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to think about his intentions. He said he started writing things down because he wanted to remember important details about her. He was trying to be thoughtful and not forget, which is a good intention. He didn't share it with anyone else, which suggests he wasn't using it in a manipulative way. The problem seems to be how she perceived it. She felt that having a written list cheapened the gestures and made it seem like he was just following a script instead of genuinely remembering because he cared.\n\nBut why would she feel that way? Maybe she thought that if he was writing things down, he wasn't really paying attention and was just using the notes to act nice. It could make her feel like his actions were insincere, like he was planning them in advance rather than being spontaneous. That could be hurtful because she might have wanted his gestures to come from a place of genuine love and memory, not from a list. \n\nOn the other hand, he's trying to be a good partner by not forgetting things, which is a common issue in relationships. People often appreciate when partners remember their likes and dislikes. However, the method he chose (a written playbook) might have triggered her insecurities or changed her perception of his actions. \n\nAnother angle is trust. If she found out about the Almanac, maybe she felt that he wasn't transparent about his methods. Even if his intentions were good, keeping it a secret might have made her feel like he wasn't honest. The fact that he didn't show it to anyone and it was a secret could have led to her feeling like he was holding back or manipulating their interactions.\n\nBut then again, he didn't use the Almanac in a harmful way. He was using it to remember, not to deceive. The problem is more about her emotional response. In relationships, how one person's actions are perceived by the other can be more important than the actual intent. So even if he meant well, her feeling of betrayal is valid. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If his actions were meant to be kind and he didn't do anything deceptive, he might not be entirely at fault. However, not considering how she might perceive the Almanac could mean that he didn't fully understand her perspective. Maybe he should have discussed it with her instead of keeping it a secret. \n\nIn relationships, transparency is key. Even though he had good intentions, keeping such a personal project a secret might have led to misunderstandings. Her reaction is about feeling like her trust was violated or that his gestures were insincere. He needs to validate her feelings and work on communication. \n\nSo, while he might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, the way he kept it secret and how it affected her emotions could mean that he is at least partially responsible. The answer might depend on cultural or personal views on privacy and relationship dynamics. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, considering her feelings and the impact of his actions, maybe he is somewhat at fault for not anticipating her reaction or discussing it with her.\n"
