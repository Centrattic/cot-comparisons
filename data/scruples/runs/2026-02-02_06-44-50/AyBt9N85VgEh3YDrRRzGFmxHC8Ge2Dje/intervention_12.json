She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for having an \"Almanac,\" which is a notebook where he writes down all sorts of details about his wife's preferences and memories. The wife found out about it and is upset, feeling like it's a playbook and that he's betraying her trust.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband created this notebook to remember things he might forget, but the wife now sees it as a manipulation tactic. The key here is the wife's reaction. She felt that the Almanac cheapened the sweet things he did for her, implying she might feel like the gestures were insincere because they were planned from a list. \n\nFrom the husband's perspective, he did this out of love and to avoid being the guy who forgets important things. He kept it private and only used it to make her happy. But the wife's feelings are hurt, and she's upset. That's a red flag. Even if his intentions were good, the effect on her is negative.\n\nThe question is about whether he's in the wrong. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) context usually looks at both intentions and consequences. His intentions were to be attentive and loving, but the consequence is that his wife feels betrayed. Trust and transparency are important in relationships. Even though he didn't share it with others, the fact that he kept it hidden and it's causing her emotional distress might mean he's in the wrong. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the wife felt that the notes were insincere. If she believes he's using the Almanac as a playbook rather than genuinely remembering things from their time together, that could undermine her perception of his affection. The husband might need to acknowledge her feelings and adjust his approach, maybe by being more open about his intentions and reassuring her that his actions are heartfelt. \n\nBut does that mean he's in the wrong? If he didn't intend harm but caused hurt, it's a gray area. However, since he's the one who created the Almanac without considering how his wife might feel about it, he might be at fault for not being more sensitive to her perspective. So, the answer could be A (he's in the wrong) because the action, while well-intentioned, caused harm due to lack of transparency and understanding of her feelings.\n"
