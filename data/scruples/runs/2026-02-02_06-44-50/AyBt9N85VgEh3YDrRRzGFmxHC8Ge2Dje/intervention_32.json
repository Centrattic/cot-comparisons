She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for having an \"Almanac\" of notes about his wife. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author started keeping a notebook with details about his wife's preferences, things she mentioned, etc., to remember them so he can do sweet things for her. He didn't share this with anyone, and he saw it as a way to show his love. However, his wife found out, and she's upset. She felt it cheapened his gestures and called it a \"playbook,\" making her feel like he was using it to play a game rather than genuinely remembering her. \n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's actions were wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's trying to be attentive and loving by remembering important details. He didn't share it, and he saw it as a personal way to ensure he didn't forget things. He didn't mean to make her feel used or like he was keeping a playbook. His intention was good \u2014 to avoid being the guy who forgets things, which many women complain about.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction suggests that she felt uncomfortable with the idea of him keeping a list. Even though he had good intentions, the existence of the notebook might have made her feel like her personal information was being stored for his benefit, perhaps implying that he might not trust himself to remember without notes. Some people might see this as intrusive or manipulative, even if it's not intended that way. She might have preferred that he remembered things naturally rather than relying on a written list, which could feel like a lack of genuine effort or commitment to remember without aids.\n\nAnother angle: trust and boundaries. The wife didn't know about the notebook, and when she found out, she felt betrayed. Even if the author didn't mean anything bad, the secrecy around the notebook might have contributed to her feeling that her privacy was invaded. People often have different expectations regarding personal information and how it's handled in a relationship. \n\nHowever, the author didn't have any malicious intent. He was trying to be thoughtful and loving. The problem might be a miscommunication or differing perspectives on what constitutes genuine effort. The wife might value spontaneity and natural memory more, while the author uses the notebook as a tool to ensure he doesn't forget. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, intent versus impact. The author's intent was positive, but the impact on his wife was negative. In relationships, how actions affect the other person matters. Even if the action is well-meaning, if it causes hurt, there's a responsibility to address it. However, the author didn't do anything deceitful or harmful beyond keeping the notebook secret. The wife's feelings are valid, but the notebook itself wasn't inherently wrong. \n\nThe key here is whether keeping the notebook was a breach of trust or privacy. If the wife didn't ask him not to take notes, and he didn't share it with others, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But her perspective is that it made her feel used, which is a significant emotional response. \n\nIn some cases, people might see the notebook as a genuine effort to be attentive, while others might see it as a crutch. The fact that she's considering destroying it shows the depth of her hurt. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might not be in the wrong because his intentions were good and there's no evidence of harm beyond the emotional impact on his wife. However, the way he handled it (keeping it secret) could be part of the issue. But ultimately, the wife's feelings are valid, and the author needs to address her concerns, perhaps by explaining his intentions and finding a compromise. \n\nGiven that, I think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the action itself is neutral, done with good intentions, and there's no malicious intent. However, the author should take responsibility for not discussing this with his wife earlier and address her feelings.\n"
