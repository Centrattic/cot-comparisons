She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about his \"Almanac,\" which is a notebook where he writes down personal details about his wife. He did this to remember things she mentioned, like her love for lilacs and other preferences. The problem came up when she found the Almanac and felt betrayed, thinking it was a \"playbook\" instead of a genuine expression of his love.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions. The user says he started the Almanac to remember things so he could do sweet things for her. He didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. His motivation seems to be love and care, not to manipulate or control. That's a good point in his favor.\n\nOn the other hand, his wife felt that the existence of the Almanac made her feel like her partner was using a script, which cheapened the gestures. She might have felt that the notes were not sincere because they were written down and used as a reference. Even if his intentions were good, maybe the act of keeping such a detailed record without her knowledge made her uncomfortable. It could be seen as a breach of privacy or a lack of trust, even if it's not in a negative way.\n\nBut he wasn't using it to deceive her. The problem might be in how she perceived it. Different people have different expectations in relationships. Some might see note-taking as a thoughtful way to remember, while others might see it as necessary because the person can't remember naturally. The wife might have wanted his gestures to be spontaneous and heartfelt without any preparation, which isn't reasonable because everyone has different memory capacities.\n\nAnother angle is communication. He didn't tell her about the Almanac, which could have led to misunderstandings. If he had mentioned it earlier as a way to stay connected, maybe she wouldn't have felt betrayed. However, he thought it was a private way to express his love, not realizing it might be perceived differently.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? His actions were well-intentioned but perhaps didn't consider her perspective. It's possible that the issue is more about their communication styles rather than him being wrong. He didn't intend to hurt her, but the outcome was hurtful. Maybe the answer is that he didn't do anything wrong, but he needs to communicate better. The wife's reaction is valid because she felt betrayed, but that doesn't necessarily mean the husband was in the wrong. It's a misunderstanding based on differing viewpoints.\n"
