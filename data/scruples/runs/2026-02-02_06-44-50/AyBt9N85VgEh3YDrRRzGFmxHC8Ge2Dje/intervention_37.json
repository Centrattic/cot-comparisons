She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author wrote a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole\" post about keeping an Almanac, which is a notebook where he records details about his wife's preferences, likes, etc. He started this when they first met, because he wanted to remember important things she mentioned. He never shared it with anyone and used it to do sweet things for her. Then his wife found it, got upset, felt like it was a \"playbook,\" and now they're having issues.\n\nThe question is whether he was wrong to keep this notebook. The user thinks he is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let me consider the wife's perspective. She might feel that keeping track of her preferences in such a way is manipulative, like he's using a strategy to get brownie points or control the relationship. She might also feel that the notes are an invasion of privacy, even though he compiled them from things she told him. She could see it as her sharing personal information that he's now using to his advantage, which can make her uncomfortable. The term \"playbook\" suggests she sees it as a calculated approach rather than genuine affection.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was good. He wanted to remember things to show his love and be attentive. He didn't share it with anyone and it was meant to be a personal tool. He might not have realized that keeping it private and using it could make her feel that he's not genuinely remembering but rather relying on notes. The key issue here is communication. He didn't discuss this with her beforehand, so she wasn't aware of his reasons until she found it. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong because even though his intentions were good, the action of keeping a secret record without her knowledge could be seen as a breach of trust. It's possible that by documenting these things, he created a scenario where she feels her personal information is being used in a manipulative way, even if that's not his intent. The fact that she felt betrayed suggests that the method of keeping the Almanac was problematic. \n\nAlternatively, if his actions were meant to be a way to show his love and he wasn't using it for any ulterior motive, then he might not be in the wrong. However, he should have considered how she might feel about it and discussed it with her before keeping such a detailed record. The problem could be that he didn't take her feelings into account regarding the method he chose to remember things. \n\nIn relationships, transparency is important. Even if the Almanac was a well-meaning gesture, the lack of communication about it might have led to her feeling uneasy. The wife's reaction is valid because she didn't consent to having her personal details recorded in this way. It's possible that she values spontaneity and genuine memory over notes, and the existence of the Almanac makes her feel like her partner isn't fully present in the relationship. \n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author might have acted with good intentions but overlooked his wife's potential discomfort with the method he used. Therefore, he could be in the wrong because the action of keeping the Almanac without discussing it with her led to feelings of betrayal and being used. The answer would be A (yes, he's in the wrong). However, there's also an argument that his intentions were pure, but the problem is more about miscommunication. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the wife feels betrayed, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
