She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who keeps an \"Almanac\" with notes about his wife's preferences and details. His wife found out and is upset, feeling betrayed because she thought he just remembered naturally. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's intention was to remember important things about his wife because he wanted to do sweet things for her. He didn't share it with anyone and considered it a personal way to show his love. On the other hand, his wife feels the Almanac is a \"playbook,\" making her feel like he's just using it to get brownie points instead of genuinely remembering from the heart.\n\nThe key points here are about consent and the nature of the gesture. Did he consult her before keeping such a detailed record? The answer is no. He did it on his own, assuming it would make her feel loved. However, his wife might value spontaneity and genuine effort more than planned gestures, even if they're thoughtful. The way she feels betrayed suggests that having a written list makes her feel like the love is inauthentic or calculated.\n\nAnother angle is about the emotional impact. The author didn't intend to hurt her, but the act of keeping the Almanac might have been a breach of trust in her perception. She might feel that he was keeping secrets or treating their relationship like a checklist. Even if his intentions were good, the outcome was hurtful. \n\nIn relationships, what's important is how each partner feels. Even if the action is well-meaning, if it makes the other person uncomfortable, it's a problem. The author might have to consider that his wife values different expressions of love. Maybe she wants him to remember without a system, which would make her feel more appreciated. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He didn't do anything malicious, but he didn't consider her feelings about how he was showing his love. The fact that she's upset and feels betrayed indicates that he overstepped, even if unintentionally. Therefore, he might be at fault for not discussing this with her or understanding her perspective on the matter.\n"
