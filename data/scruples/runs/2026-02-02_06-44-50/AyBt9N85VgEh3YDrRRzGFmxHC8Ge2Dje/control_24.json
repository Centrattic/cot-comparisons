She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for keeping an Almanac with his wife's personal details. \n\nFirst, the backstory: The couple met in 2008. The husband started writing down his wife's favorite things in a notebook called The Almanac. He did this to remember important details so he could do sweet things for her. The wife found the notebook and now feels betrayed, calling it a \"playbook\" that cheapens his gestures. She's upset and considering destroying it.\n\nSo the question is whether the husband did something wrong. The key points here are about intention versus perception. The husband's intention was to remember things and show his love, but the wife perceived it as a manipulative list. \n\nIn relationships, communication and consent are important. The husband didn't hide it from her before, but he also didn't discuss it with her. The wife's reaction is about feeling like her private details are being used as a strategy, which might make her feel objectified. Even though the husband's intention was good, the act of keeping a secret list might have breached her trust. \n\nThe wife's feelings are valid. She might see the Almanac as a tool he uses to control or script their interactions instead of genuine gestures. The fact that she mentioned feeling betrayed suggests that she values spontaneity and authenticity over planned actions based on a list. \n\nThe husband might not have realized that keeping such a secret, even with good intentions, could make her feel uneasy. It's possible that the act of compiling information in a notebook, even if well-meaning, crosses a line by treating her preferences as data points rather than personal, shared experiences. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's actions were meant to show love and effort. He wasn't using it to manipulate but to remember. However, the issue here is about how it was received. In relationships, actions are judged not just by intent but by impact. If the wife feels hurt and betrayed, the husband's actions, while well-intentioned, have caused harm. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be that the husband is not in the wrong because his intentions were good, but some might argue that he should have considered his wife's perspective and discussed it with her. However, given the context, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because the intentions were positive, even if the outcome was negative.\n"
