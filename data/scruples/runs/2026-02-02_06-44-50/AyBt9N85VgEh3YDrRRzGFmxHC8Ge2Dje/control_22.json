She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an almanac where he jots down personal details about his wife. The situation is that he created this book to remember her favorite things so he could do sweet things for her. But when she found out, she felt betrayed and saw it as a \"playbook,\" making her feel like he wasn't genuine.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about intention versus perception. The author's intention was positive\u2014he wanted to remember things to show his love and care. He kept it private, never showed anyone. But the wife's reaction is negative, feeling like the notes cheapened his gestures. She perceived it as something manipulative rather than heartfelt.\n\nI need to consider if keeping such a personal journal is inherently wrong. On one hand, he's trying to be thoughtful, which is a good thing. On the other hand, she might feel that it's insincere because it's a list of things to do, making her question his genuine feelings. The problem here is about trust and how the action was received.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, he didn't have bad intentions, but maybe he didn't consider how she might feel if she found out. The issue isn't the act of taking notes itself, but the fact that the wife feels hurt and betrayed by it. The author might need to understand that while his intentions were good, the way she perceives it is important. He should focus on communication to explain his reasons and reassure her that his love is genuine, not just following a list.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he didn't do anything malicious. However, he could have been more considerate of how his actions might be perceived. But according to the options given, the answer is either A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). Since the author's intentions were good and there's no malicious intent, the answer would likely be B. But the wife's feelings are valid too. It's a situation where communication is key, but the act itself isn't wrong. So the author isn't at fault, so answer B.\n"
