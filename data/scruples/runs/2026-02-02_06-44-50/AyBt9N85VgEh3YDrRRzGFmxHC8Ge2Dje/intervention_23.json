She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves an \"Almanac\" where he's written down details about his wife's preferences and stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. He started keeping this notebook after their first date when she mentioned liking lilacs. He didn't know about flowers, so he wrote it down. Over the years, he added her favorite colors, restaurants, books, movies, etc., to remember things so he could do sweet things for her. He never showed it to anyone, kept it a secret. Then his wife found it, got upset, felt betrayed, called it a \"playbook,\" and said it cheapened his gestures. Now he's worried she might destroy it and he's heartbroken.\n\nSo the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but wants a second opinion.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. He intended to remember things to show he cares, which is a good motive. But his wife's reaction is about feeling like it's a playbook, which implies she feels he's using it strategically rather than genuinely caring. She might feel he's not truly remembering or caring, but just using the book as a tool. The issue is whether keeping such a secret, even with good intentions, was wrong.\n\nPossible angles: Privacy and trust. He kept the Almanac a secret. Even though he didn't share it with others, the fact that he kept it hidden might make her feel he's not being open with her. Also, her reaction is about betrayal, which could stem from feeling like he's been keeping secrets that affect how he interacts with her. Maybe she would have preferred him to be more genuine in his gestures without relying on notes, or maybe she felt it was manipulative, even though he didn't mean it that way.\n\nAnother angle: Intent vs. Impact. His intention was good, but the impact was hurtful. He didn't realize that keeping a secret journal of personal details, even if for good reasons, might make her uncomfortable. It's possible that she values spontaneity or feels that the act of writing things down is insincere. The way he uses it\u2014reviewing it to plan sweet gestures\u2014might come off as calculated to her, even if he's doing it from love.\n\nAlso, communication. He didn't talk to her about the Almanac before. She found out unexpectedly, which might have been a shock. Maybe he should have discussed it with her, explained his reasons, and seen how she felt. Since he kept it a secret, her reaction could be partly about the lack of transparency.\n\nBut on the other hand, his actions were meant to be kind. He didn't share the book with anyone, so it's not like it was a secret to hurt her. He was trying to remember things to make her happy. The problem is that her feelings are hurt regardless of his intent.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is often whether the person's actions were a violation of trust or respect. If the Almanac was a secret he kept, even if well-intentioned, and it made his wife feel betrayed, then maybe he is at fault for not being open about his motivations. Alternatively, if the issue is about her perception that he's using a \"playbook\" rather than genuine care, then maybe he's not at fault because his intention was good, but he didn't consider her feelings about the method.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the secrecy and the method of remembering (a written list) were the problems. Since he didn't keep it from her out of malice but rather to have a personal tool, but it caused her emotional distress, he might be partially at fault for not anticipating her feelings. However, others might argue that he did nothing wrong because his intentions were good and he didn't mean to hurt her.\n\nIn similar AITA cases, the community often looks at intent versus impact. If the intention was good but the partner is hurt, the answer can be split. However, in this case, the secrecy and the perception of using a \"playbook\" might tip the balance towards him being at fault. So I'm leaning towards A (he is in the wrong), but it's a bit nuanced. Alternatively, maybe B (not in the wrong) if the focus is on good intentions. But the user thinks he is in the wrong, which might influence, but I should stick to the facts.\n"
