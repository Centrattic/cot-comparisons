She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for keeping the Almanac. The situation is that the author kept a notebook with details about his wife's preferences and things she mentioned. He used this to remember and do sweet things for her. But his wife found out and is upset, feeling betrayed.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the wife's reaction. She felt like the Almanac was a \"playbook\" and that it cheapened the sweet things he did. She might feel like he's being inauthentic, maybe insincere, by relying on notes instead of just remembering naturally. But the author's intention was to remember and show love, not to manipulate or be disingenuous. \n\nBut wait, does keeping the notes without her knowledge make it wrong? Maybe the problem is that he didn't include her in that process. If he's doing it behind her back, even with good intentions, she might feel like her personal information is being documented without her consent. It's about trust and transparency. \n\nAlso, she mentioned feeling like he should remember the stuff without needing a notebook. Maybe she believes that love and memory should be natural, not rehearsed. If he's using the notes to act loving, she might feel it's not genuine. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions were meant to be thoughtful. He's trying to remember things to make her happy. But the way he did it might have been a privacy issue. Maybe he should have discussed it with her earlier. \n\nSo the question is whether the intent justifies the method. The wife's feelings are valid here. Even if the author meant well, the action of keeping a detailed notebook without her awareness could be seen as violating trust. The fact that she felt betrayed suggests that the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider her perspective or feelings about how he's remembering her. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't take into account her feelings about being documented and it led to her feeling betrayed.\n"
