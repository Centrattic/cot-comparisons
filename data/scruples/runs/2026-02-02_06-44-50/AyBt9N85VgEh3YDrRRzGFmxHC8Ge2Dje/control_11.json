She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an Almanac, which is a notebook where he writes down personal details about his wife. The wife found out and felt betrayed, thinking it was a \"playbook\" that cheapened his gestures. The author is confused because he did it out of love and to remember important things.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The key points are the wife's reaction versus the husband's intention. The husband didn't mean to do anything wrong; he wanted to remember things to make her happy. But the wife feels like it's insincere, like he's just using a list instead of genuinely caring. \n\nThe question is about whether the husband is at fault. From a moral standpoint, intentions matter. If he didn't have any malicious intent, he's not inherently wrong. However, maybe the action of keeping a secret notebook without her knowledge made her feel uncomfortable. Trust is important in a relationship. Even if his intention was good, not discussing such a personal project with her might have been a mistake. \n\nThe wife's feelings are valid. She felt that the notes reduced the sincerity of his actions. If he had talked to her about it, maybe she would have understood his intent. The fact that he never showed it to anyone might have made her feel like he's keeping a part of their relationship hidden. \n\nBut the husband is also trying to remember things because he cares. The problem is the perception. The wife might feel that having a list makes his gestures less genuine, even if he's doing it out of love. So, is he wrong? It depends on whether the method of keeping the Almanac was respectful to her feelings. Since he didn't consider that she might see it as manipulative, maybe he made a mistake in not discussing it with her earlier. \n\nIn conclusion, the husband's intentions are good, but the way he handled it might have been inconsiderate of his wife's perspective. He might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, but the action itself, without her knowledge, could be seen as a misstep. However, the question is whether he's \"in the wrong,\" and since his actions were not malicious, the answer might be B (No), but there's room for argument either way. But based on the options given, the answer is probably B because the wrong was unintentional.\n"
