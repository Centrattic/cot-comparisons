She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the situation is about a man who wrote down all these personal details about his wife in a notebook called \"The Almanac.\" He did this to remember her favorite things and to do sweet things for her. But when his wife found out, she felt betrayed and thought it was like a \"playbook,\" which made her feel cheapened. Now the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. From his perspective, he didn't mean to do anything bad. He was just trying to remember important things about her. But she's hurt by it. So maybe it's about transparency and trust. He kept this secret, even though he used it to remember things, but she felt like it was manipulative. Does keeping such a personal record without her knowledge cross a line?\n\nI know that sometimes in relationships, what one person sees as thoughtful can be seen by another as controlling or not trusting them. Since the wife didn't know about the notebook, he kept it hidden. Even if his intentions were good, not discussing it with her first might have been a mistake. Maybe she felt that he was treating their relationship as something that needed a strategy instead of genuine love and effort. \n\nAlso, when she asked about it, he admitted to it without trying to downplay it, which shows he's honest. But the fact that she's upset now suggests that her feelings about privacy and authenticity in the relationship were violated. Maybe he should have been more open about his intentions earlier. \n\nSo, the author's actions were well-meaning, but the lack of communication might have led to her feeling betrayed. So, even if he didn't think he was wrong, his actions from her perspective were hurtful. In that case, he might be in the wrong because he didn't consider how she might perceive it and kept it secret. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe it's not his fault entirely. It's a bit of a gray area.\n"
