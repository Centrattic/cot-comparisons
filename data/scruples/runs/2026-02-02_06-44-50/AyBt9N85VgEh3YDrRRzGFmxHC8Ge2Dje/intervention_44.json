She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband having an \"Almanac\" where he writes down personal details about his wife to remember them. The wife found out and is upset because she feels it's cheapened his gestures and that it's like a playbook, leading to betrayal feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's intention was to remember things he cares about, which seems genuine. He didn't share it with anyone and did it out of love. But the wife's reaction is important too. She might feel that keeping a secret like that shows a lack of transparency. Maybe she feels he was using her personal details in a way that's manipulative or insincere, like planning surprises rather than just naturally remembering things. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he didn't have bad intentions, but maybe he didn't consider her perspective. Some people might find it endearing, while others could see it as intrusive. The key here is that the wife was upset by the existence of the notebook, not because of any specific action he did. The husband didn't do anything harmful, but the fact that he kept it secret and it made her feel betrayed is a problem. \n\nDoes that mean he's in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. He was trying to be thoughtful. But perhaps he should have discussed it with her instead of keeping it a secret. By not being open about it, he might have violated her trust, even if unintentionally. \n\nSo, the answer could be A (Yes) because keeping such a private notebook without discussing it could be seen as a breach of trust, even if the motive was good. Alternatively, B (No) because his intentions were good and he was just trying to remember things for her. \n\nBut since the wife's feelings are valid and the issue stems from lack of communication, the husband might be partially at fault. However, in AITA scenarios, the focus is on whether the person is in the wrong. If the husband's actions, though well-intentioned, caused harm without his intent, does that make him in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. \n\nI think the answer is A. Even though his intentions were good, the fact that he kept such a personal record secret and it made his wife feel betrayed means he's at least somewhat at fault for not being transparent. So, Answer A.\n"
