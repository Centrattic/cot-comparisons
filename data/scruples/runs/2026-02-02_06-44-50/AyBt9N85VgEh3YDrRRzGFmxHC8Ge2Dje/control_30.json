She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding the Almanac they wrote about their wife. The story is about the husband creating a notebook with all the details about his wife's preferences, which he uses to remember things for her. The wife found out, and now she's upset, feeling that it's a playbook and that he's being manipulative. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband created the Almanac to remember important details about his wife because he wants to be a good partner. He didn't share it with anyone, and it started as a personal way to keep track of things. The wife's reaction is unexpected, as she feels betrayed and thinks it's inauthentic. \n\nWhy would she feel that way? Maybe she values spontaneity in the relationship. If he's using a notebook to remember things, she might feel that he's not truly paying attention or that he's being calculating. Even though the husband's intention is genuine, the wife's perception is that it's a playbook, which could make her feel like the gestures are insincere. \n\nIs the husband wrong? His actions come from a place of trying to remember and show love, which is positive. However, the issue might be that he didn't consider her feelings about being documented. Maybe she's uncomfortable with the idea of her personal details being written down, even if it's for a good reason. The husband didn't anticipate that she might see it as invasive or manipulative. \n\nThe key here is whether the husband intended to deceive or manipulate. Since he's using it to genuinely care for her, it's not malicious. But the problem is the lack of communication. He kept the Almanac private, and when she found out, she felt a breach of trust. The husband didn't ask her if she was okay with this practice, so it's possible he didn't consider her perspective. \n\nIn relationships, transparency is important. Even well-meaning actions can be problematic if they don't align with the partner's expectations. The husband's mistake might be not discussing his method with her, leading to a situation where she feels her privacy was invaded. \n\nBut then again, the husband's intent is to be attentive. The wife's reaction is about feeling that his actions are inauthentic. It's a conflict between the husband's method of showing love and the wife's need for genuine, unscripted interactions. \n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. If his intent was good and there was no malice, but he failed to consider her feelings, then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if the method of keeping an \"almanac\" is inherently manipulative, even if the intent is good, then he could be. \n\nIn many cases, people might see keeping notes as a positive way to remember details. But if it's presented as a playbook, it can feel like he's strategizing rather than genuinely caring. The wife's interpretation is key here. Since the husband didn't intend to be manipulative, but the result is her feeling betrayed, it's a matter of differing views on what constitutes genuine care. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the husband's actions, while well-intentioned, disregarded the wife's need for authenticity in the relationship. If the husband's method is making her feel like he's using a script, then he might be in the wrong, even if he didn't mean to. Alternatively, if the wife is overreacting to a harmless practice, then he's not. \n\nIn conclusion, the husband's intentions are good, but he might have overlooked his wife's perspective. The fault isn't entirely on him, but there's room for communication. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer would depend on whether the action itself is wrong, regardless of intent. Given that he didn't do it with malice, but the wife feels betrayed, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong, but he needs to address the communication gap. However, if the act of keeping a \"playbook\" is inherently deceitful, then he could be. Given the detailed explanation, the answer is B, he's not in the wrong, but there's a need for dialogue.\n"
