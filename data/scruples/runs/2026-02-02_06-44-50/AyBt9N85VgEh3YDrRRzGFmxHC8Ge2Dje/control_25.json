She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for keeping an almanac of personal notes about their wife. The situation involves the wife feeling betrayed when she discovers the notebook, which she perceives as a \"playbook\" rather than a genuine effort to remember her preferences.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was positive\u2014they wanted to remember important details about their wife to show love and avoid being forgetful. The wife, however, feels that the existence of the almanac cheapens the gestures, implying that the effort was insincere because it was pre-planned. This is a common issue in relationships where one person's method of showing affection is perceived as inauthentic by the other.\n\nThe key points to consider are the author's intent versus the wife's feelings. The author didn't hide the almanac, but they hadn't mentioned it before. The wife's reaction is emotional, feeling that the notes were a tactic rather than spontaneous acts of love. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong given that the intention was good but the outcome was hurtful.\n\nIn relationship dynamics, actions that stem from genuine care are usually not inherently wrong, but if those actions cause emotional distress, there's a need to address the underlying issue. The author might not be in the wrong for their intention, but they might need to acknowledge the wife's feelings and find a way to communicate better. However, since the wife's reaction is about feeling used or not genuinely loved, the author's approach might need adjustment. But the act of keeping notes in itself isn't wrong. The conflict arises from differing expectations about how love should be expressed. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for maintaining the almanac with good intentions, but they need to work on understanding their wife's perspective and how to express love in a way that aligns with her feelings.\n"
