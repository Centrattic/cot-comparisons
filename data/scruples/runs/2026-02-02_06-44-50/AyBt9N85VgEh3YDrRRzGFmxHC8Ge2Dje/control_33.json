She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for keeping an Almanac with details about his wife. The situation is that he started writing down stuff she told him, like her favorite things, to remember and do sweet things for her. But now his wife is upset and feels it's a playbook, making her feel betrayed.\n\nHmm, first, the author's intention was to remember things because he loves her. He didn't share it with anyone, and he used it to be thoughtful. So from his perspective, he's being considerate. But his wife reacted negatively. Why? Maybe she felt it's an invasion of privacy? Or that he's treating her like a puzzle to be solved, not genuine. \n\nThe key here is consent and communication. He didn't ask her if it was okay to write all that down. Even if he meant well, keeping a private record of her personal info without her knowing might make her uncomfortable. It could be seen as him controlling the narrative or using it to manipulate the relationship, even if not on purpose. \n\nAlso, the wife says it's cheapened the sweet things he did. Maybe she felt he wasn't being spontaneous, that he was just following a list instead of genuinely caring. That could make her feel like his actions were insincere, which would explain her betrayal feelings. \n\nBut the author didn't use it to manipulate; he just wanted to remember. However, the way he did it without her knowledge might have crossed a line. Even if the intent was good, the effect was harmful. So, the answer might be A because not respecting her privacy, even with good intentions, is wrong. Or B if the intent is what matters. \n\nI think in relationships, transparency is important. If he had shared his method with her, maybe she'd be okay with it. But keeping it secret led to her feeling betrayed. So he might be in the wrong for not discussing it with her first.\n"
