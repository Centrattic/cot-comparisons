She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for keeping an Almanac of his wife's preferences and memories. The situation is that he started writing down things like her favorite colors, books, etc., to remember and do sweet things for her. Now his wife is upset, feeling betrayed, and thinks it's a \"playbook.\" The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the intentions. The author clearly states that his motivation was love and to avoid being forgetful. He never shared it with anyone and kept it private. The wife, on the other hand, feels that having a written list makes the gestures feel inauthentic. She might be interpreting the notes as a strategy to manipulate her, rather than genuine effort.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, his intention was good. He wanted to remember important things about her. However, the problem arises from how his wife perceives it. Even though his intentions are pure, the way the Almanac was discovered might have made her feel that he's not making genuine efforts but relying on a list. In relationships, perception matters a lot. If his wife feels that the notes make her feel like he's using a playbook instead of showing genuine care, then the author might not be aware of her emotional response.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? He didn't have bad intentions. He was trying to be thoughtful. The issue here might be communication. Maybe he should have discussed the Almanac with her earlier to explain his reasons. However, he was keeping it private because he thought it was a personal way of showing love. The wife's reaction seems more about feeling disrespected or that the efforts are insincere rather than the act of keeping notes itself.\n\nIn some perspectives, keeping a list is just a tool to remember things, which is a valid approach. But in relationships, sometimes the effort and the personal touch matter more than the method. If the wife feels that the list is making her feel like she's being studied or that the gestures are planned rather than spontaneous, that could be hurtful. The author might not be at fault for the intention, but maybe he didn't consider how she might perceive it. \n\nHowever, the key point is that the author didn't lie or deceive. He kept the Almanac as a personal tool. The wife's reaction is about her feelings of being unappreciated or that the efforts are insincere. The author's mistake might be not understanding her perspective and not realizing that the method of keeping notes affected her feelings, even if his intentions were good. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because his intentions were genuine and loving. The issue stems from a miscommunication or differing views on what constitutes genuine effort in a relationship. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
