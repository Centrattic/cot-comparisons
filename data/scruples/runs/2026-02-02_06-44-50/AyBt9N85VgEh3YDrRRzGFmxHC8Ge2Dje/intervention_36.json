She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a \"playbook\" of notes he took about his wife's preferences and memories.\n\nFirst, the husband created this almanac to remember important things about his wife so he could do sweet things for her. He didn't show it to anyone except her, and he didn't lie about it. But when she found out, she felt betrayed and thought it was a playbook, which made her feel like he wasn't genuine. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. So, why would he be in the wrong? Maybe because keeping a secret like that could be seen as a lack of transparency. Even though his intentions were good, maybe he didn't consider her feelings about being reduced to a list of notes. She might feel objectified or like he's using the information to manipulate his way into her life, rather than genuinely trying to remember her. \n\nOn the other hand, he was trying to be thoughtful and remember things, which is a positive intention. He didn't share it with others, so maybe it's a personal thing. But maybe he should have included her in the process instead of keeping it a secret. If she didn't know about it, she might feel like he's keeping secrets or not being authentic.\n\nThe key points here are intention vs. perception. His intention was to be loving and remember her, but her perception was that he was using a playbook. The question is whether the action was wrong because of the intention or the impact. If the impact hurt her and made her feel betrayed, even with good intentions, he might be in the wrong because the action led to negative feelings. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because while the intention was good, the act of keeping a secret, detailed list could come across as manipulative rather than genuine. Alternatively, if the problem is that he didn't consider her perspective, then he's at fault for not discussing it with her. So, leaning towards A.\n"
