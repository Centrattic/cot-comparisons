She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Almanac is in the wrong. The author created a notebook with all the details about his wife's preferences and memories, intending to remember things to do sweet things for her. But his wife found it and felt betrayed, calling it a \"playbook\" and feeling like the sweet gestures were cheapened.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author did something wrong. Well, the author's intention was good, to remember important things about his wife. He didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. However, his wife's reaction shows she felt it was manipulative or insincere. Maybe she felt like he wasn't genuinely paying attention and was just using a checklist. \n\nBut the author argues he's trying to be thoughtful. The problem might be communication. He didn't realize that keeping a secret notebook might come across as inauthentic to her. Maybe in relationships, transparency and spontaneity are important. If he had mentioned the notebook and his reasons, maybe she would have understood. But since she found out and felt hurt, it's a matter of perspective. \n\nIs it the author's fault for not considering her feelings? Maybe. He thought he was being loving, but the method of keeping it secret led to her feeling like he wasn't genuine. The answer might be A, because even if his intentions were good, the action of keeping it a secret and using a \"playbook\" might not align with her expectations of genuine effort. But others might say he's not at fault because he meant well and it's a misunderstanding. \n\nWait, the wife's reaction is intense. She's dejected and thinking of destroying it. The author is heartbroken. It's a complex situation. The key is whether the act itself was wrong. The author didn't do anything harmful, but the perception is the issue. In relationships, sometimes actions that are meant to be kind can backfire if they make the partner feel objectified or used. So maybe the answer is A, yes, he's in the wrong because the method, while well-intentioned, caused harm. Alternatively, B could be if it's seen as a misunderstanding. But the question is about being in the wrong. Since he didn't intend harm but the action caused hurt, maybe he's not at fault. But some might say he should have known better, hence A. I'm a bit torn but leaning towards A because the wife's feelings are valid, and he should have considered how she might perceive it.\n"
