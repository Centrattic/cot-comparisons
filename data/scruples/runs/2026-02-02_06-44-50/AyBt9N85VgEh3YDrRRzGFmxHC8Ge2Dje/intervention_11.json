She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who kept a notebook, called \"The Almanac,\" where he wrote down personal details about his wife to remember them and plan thoughtful gestures. His wife found out and is upset, feeling that this cheapened his actions and made her feel like he was using a playbook.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The author's intention was to remember things about his wife to make her feel loved. He didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. The wife's reaction is feeling betrayed and that the actions were insincere because he was using a list. She mentioned it's a \"playbook,\" implying she feels he's just following a script instead of being genuine. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but wants another perspective. \n\nOn one hand, the author's actions were motivated by love and wanting to remember important things. He didn't intend to hurt her, and he was trying to be a considerate partner. Keeping notes might be a way to ensure he doesn't forget, which is a common strategy for people with busy lives or memory issues. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife felt betrayed and that the gestures were not genuine. Even though the intention was good, the action of keeping a list might have made her feel that the love was insincere or calculated. Trust and authenticity in relationships are crucial. If she perceives that his actions are part of a strategy rather than spontaneous expressions of love, it could damage her feelings. \n\nAnother angle: communication. The author didn't realize that keeping such a list might be an issue for his wife. He might not have considered her perspective. Even if his intention was good, not discussing it with her could lead to misunderstandings. \n\nBut then again, the wife's reaction seems a bit harsh. The author's actions were private and done out of love. The problem might stem from her insecurities or past experiences where someone used a similar playbook in a manipulative way. \n\nIs it the author's fault for keeping notes, or is it more about the wife's feelings? The question of right or wrong can be tricky here. In relationships, actions are only wrong if they intentionally harm or violate trust. The author didn't lie about his intentions; he was honest when he explained it. However, the fact that she felt cheapened suggests that the action, while well-intentioned, had unintended consequences. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the wife felt that the gestures were insincere because of the list, then maybe the author's method of remembering things has caused harm, even if he didn't mean to. But does the method itself make him in the wrong? Or is it about the wife's perception? \n\nIn some cases, people might see keeping notes as a genuine effort to remember, while others might see it as inauthentic. It's subjective. However, since the wife is the one feeling betrayed and the author's actions led to her distress, there might be a responsibility to adjust his approach. But the author didn't have malicious intent. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions might not be inherently wrong, but they might need to adjust how he expresses love to align with his wife's needs. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, it's possible that the answer leans towards \"not in the wrong\" because his intentions were good. But if the wife's feelings are valid and the action caused harm, maybe he is partially in the wrong for not anticipating her reaction. \n\nBut the key here is that he didn't lie, he kept it private, and his actions were motivated by love. So, maybe the answer is that he's not in the wrong. However, if the wife's feelings are valid, then he might need to consider her perspective. This is a bit of a toss-up. \n\nI think the correct answer here is that the author is not in the wrong. His intentions were good, and he didn't act deceitfully. The issue is more about their communication and differing views on what constitutes genuine effort in a relationship. The wife's reaction is based on her feelings, but the author's actions don't seem malicious. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
