She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who kept a personal journal called \"The Almanac\" where he wrote down details about his wife's preferences and other personal things to remember them and do sweet things for her. Now his wife is upset, feeling that the Almanac is a \"playbook\" and that he's using it to manipulate her, which has made her feel betrayed.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want my opinion. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was positive. He wanted to remember important things about his wife to show his love and avoid being forgetful. That's a good motive. But the issue here is about consent and the wife's feelings. The wife didn't know about the Almanac until she found it, and now she feels that the sweet gestures were insincere because they were based on a written list. She might feel that instead of trying to understand her naturally, he's relying on a script, which could make her question the authenticity of his actions.\n\nEven though the author didn't share the Almanac with anyone, keeping it a secret might have been part of the problem. In a relationship, transparency and mutual understanding are important. If the wife had known that he was keeping track of her likes and dislikes, maybe she would have appreciated it. But since it was a secret, and she found it out in a way that made her feel betrayed, that's a problem.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions, though well-intentioned, violated the wife's trust or made her feel uncomfortable. The wife's reaction is valid because she didn't consent to being documented in this way. Even if the intention was good, the act of keeping a secret list without discussing it could be seen as manipulative or controlling from her perspective. \n\nThe author might not have considered how the wife would feel if she discovered the Almanac. In relationships, it's important to communicate about such things. If the author had shared his approach with her earlier, he might have avoided this issue. Now, the fact that she's upset and feeling betrayed suggests that the action, while coming from a place of love, was not communicated properly.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions were good, the execution might have been inconsiderate. The wife's feelings are legitimate, and the author did make a mistake by not discussing this with her. Therefore, the answer would be that he's at least partially in the wrong.\n"
