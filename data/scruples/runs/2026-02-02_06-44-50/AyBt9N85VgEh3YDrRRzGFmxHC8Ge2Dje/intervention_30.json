She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for having an \"Almanac\" of notes about his wife. The question is whether he's at fault here. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author started keeping a notebook of his wife's preferences\u2014favorite colors, restaurants, books, etc.\u2014because he wanted to remember these details to do thoughtful things for her. He never showed it to anyone, kept it private, and used it to make her feel appreciated. However, his wife found it, and she's upset. She feels like it's a \"playbook\" and that it cheapens the sweet gestures he's done. She's hurt and considering destroying it.\n\nThe key points here are the intentions of the author and the wife's reaction. The author's intention was to remember things to show his love, which is a positive motive. However, the wife's perspective is that it made her feel like he was keeping track for some ulterior motive, maybe not genuine. She might feel like he's insincere or using these notes to manipulate her appreciation. \n\nNow, why would she feel betrayed? Maybe she feels that keeping such a notebook implies he doesn't value the natural, spontaneous gestures. She might have expected him to remember these things without needing to write them down, and her feeling that he needed a playbook could make her doubt his sincerity. Trust and communication are important in relationships, so if she didn't know about this notebook and now feels like he was keeping secrets, that could be an issue. \n\nBut the author didn't intend to deceive. He kept it private because he thought it was a personal way to help himself remember. The problem arises because the wife interpreted the existence of the notebook as something inauthentic. The question is whether the author's actions crossed a line. \n\nIn terms of fault, it's possible that the author isn't in the wrong because his intentions were good, but he didn't consider how his wife might perceive it. However, the fact that he kept it secret and didn't discuss it with her might contribute to her feeling of betrayal. Even if his motives were pure, the lack of transparency could be an issue. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that keeping personal notes is a reasonable way to remember important details, especially if someone has a hard time remembering. The problem is the wife's reaction, which is valid because she's the one experiencing the hurt. The author might need to address her feelings rather than just see himself as right. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's secretiveness and the wife's perception of inauthenticity make him at fault. If the author's actions, though well-intentioned, caused his wife distress without her prior knowledge, then he might share some responsibility for not considering her feelings. However, if the issue is solely the wife's interpretation, then maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nBut in relationships, how your partner feels about something is important. Even if the action is well-meaning, causing emotional harm can make you partially at fault. So, the answer could be A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't consider her perspective, leading to her feeling betrayed. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because his intentions were good. \n\nI think the correct answer is A. Even though his intentions were good, the act of keeping a secret playbook-like notebook without her knowledge could be seen as crossing a line, especially if it made her feel like he was manipulating or insincere in his gestures. The fact that she's hurt and he's causing her emotional distress, despite good intentions, would place some fault on him. So, the answer is A.\n"
