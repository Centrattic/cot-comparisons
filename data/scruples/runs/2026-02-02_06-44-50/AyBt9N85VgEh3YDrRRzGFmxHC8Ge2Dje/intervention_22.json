She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves an \"Almanac\" he created, which is a notebook with details about his wife's preferences. His wife found it and felt hurt, thinking it's a \"playbook\" and that he's using it to manipulate sweet gestures. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author created a personal journal to remember his wife's likes and dislikes to show his love. He never shared it with anyone. His wife found it and now feels betrayed, thinking he's using it as a strategy instead of genuinely caring. The author is confused because he thought it showed his dedication. \n\nNow, the question is whether he was wrong. On one hand, keeping a journal to remember important details about a spouse can be seen as a loving gesture. On the other hand, the wife's reaction suggests that she found it manipulative. Maybe she felt it was insincere or that he wasn't remembering things naturally. \n\nI should consider the perspective of both parties. The author's intention was good\u2014to remember and do sweet things. But his wife's feelings are valid too. She might have felt that he was treating their relationship like a game with a script. The issue here is trust and how the action was perceived. \n\nThe author didn't hide the existence of the Almanac, even though he didn't mention it to anyone. But he did keep it private. When the wife found it, she was upset. The problem might be that he kept such personal information in a separate notebook, which she saw as a strategy rather than organic memory. \n\nIn relationships, transparency and understanding each other's feelings are important. The author might not have considered that his wife values spontaneity or genuine memory over prepared gestures. Even though his intention was good, the outcome was hurt feelings. \n\nSo, whether he's in the wrong depends on the context. If the wife felt that his approach made her feel like her preferences were just items on a list rather than naturally remembered, then the author might have overlooked her emotional needs. However, the author's action was meant to show love, so it's not malicious. \n\nIn some cases, people might see this as a misunderstanding rather than a wrongdoing. But since the wife is hurt and the author didn't foresee the negative reaction, maybe he should take responsibility for not considering her feelings. So, the answer could be A (he's in the wrong) because he caused hurt without intending to, but others might say B (not in the wrong) because his intention was good. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The wife's reaction is valid, so maybe he is in the wrong because he didn't consider her perspective, even if the intention was good. Alternatively, he's not in the wrong because he acted from love. It's a bit of a gray area. However, since the act led to her feeling betrayed, it's more likely A. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The author's action was a personal way to remember things, but the wife's reaction shows it made her feel untrusted. The author might need to apologize and explain, but does that mean he's in the wrong? Maybe not necessarily, but he caused hurt unintentionally. In some contexts, causing hurt without malice isn't being in the wrong. So perhaps the answer is B. Hmm. I'm torn. The user initially thought A, but maybe the answer is B. Wait, the user's own opinion is A, but they want mine. Let me decide. The key is whether the action was wrong. The author's intention was good, but the wife felt betrayed. It's a communication issue. So the author is not in the wrong because he didn't mean harm, but he needs to address her feelings. Therefore, answer B. But maybe A because the act, while well-intentioned, caused harm. Hmm. I think the answer is A because the wife's feelings are valid, and the author's action, though meant to show love, made her feel like he was using a playbook. Therefore, he is in the wrong because he didn't consider her perspective. So answer A.\n"
