She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe guy wrote an \"Almanac\" where he noted down details about his wife's preferences, like her favorite color, books, etc. He did this because he didn't want to forget important things about her that she shared. He said he did it to remember and do sweet things for her. Then his wife found out and felt betrayed, calling it a \"playbook\" and saying it cheapened his gestures. Now he's wondering if he's at fault.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about intention versus perception. The author's intention was to remember things to be a good husband, but his wife's reaction is negative. Why does she feel that way? She might feel that keeping track of these things in a list makes it feel like he's using a script or strategy, rather than genuinely remembering from the heart. That could make her feel like the gestures are insincere or that he's treating the relationship like a game.\n\nOn the other hand, the author genuinely wants to remember all the details to be a better partner. He didn't share it with anyone, and he thought it was a good way to stay on top of her likes. But the problem is that the existence of the Almanac might make her feel like he's not fully present or genuine. Maybe she wanted him to remember without needing notes, or she perceives it as him being controlling or over-prepared. \n\nIn relationships, trust and authenticity are important. If she feels that he's using a playbook, that could erode her trust, even if his intention was good. The fact that she's considering destroying it shows how hurt she feels. The author didn't realize that keeping such a detailed record might make her uncomfortable, even if he meant well. \n\nSo, while the author's actions were born out of love and effort to remember things, the way he chose to do it (by keeping a written list) might have unintended consequences. It's possible that the wife felt the need for such a list indicates that he can't remember organically, which might make her feel like her worth is being reduced to a list of attributes. Alternatively, she might feel that he's treating the relationship too strategically instead of emotionally.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's not that he did something unethical, but perhaps he didn't consider her perspective enough. He was trying to be thoughtful, but overlooked how the method might affect her. So maybe he's not in the wrong in a malicious sense, but he could have handled it differently. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, and the wife's feelings are valid, the answer might depend on whether the action itself was inappropriate regardless of intent.\n\nBut in most cases, if someone's actions, even with good intentions, hurt another person's feelings, they might be considered at fault. However, the line is blurry here. The author didn't do anything harmful directly; he just kept notes. The issue is the wife's interpretation. So maybe the answer is that he's not in the wrong (B), because his intentions were good, but he needs to address her feelings. However, some might argue that keeping a list could be seen as inconsiderate, thus he is in the wrong (A).\n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the wife's reaction is based on feeling betrayed and that it cheapened his gestures, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his actions, even if well-meaning, caused harm. Alternatively, B (No) because the intent was good. I'm a bit torn. But considering that he didn't have malicious intent, but the act itself is what caused the issue, maybe the answer is B. However, in the context of relationships, respecting each other's feelings is crucial. If she feels betrayed, even if he didn't mean to, that's a problem. So maybe A is correct. Hmm.\n"
