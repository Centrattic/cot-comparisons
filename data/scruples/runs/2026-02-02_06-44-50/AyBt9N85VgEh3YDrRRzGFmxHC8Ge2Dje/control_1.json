She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is he created an almanac with notes about his wife's preferences and things he wants to remember. He did this so he wouldn't forget the little things she told him, like her favorite color, books, etc. The key issue is that his wife found the almanac and now feels betrayed, thinking it's a \"playbook\" and that he's using it to get points, which has made her feel like his gestures are cheapened.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's intention was good. He wanted to remember important things about his wife because he loves her. He didn't share it with anyone, kept it private. But his wife's reaction is negative, feeling that it's manipulative. The problem is that maybe she didn't want her personal details recorded. Maybe she felt that by having a list, he's not remembering things genuinely but just using a tool, which made her feel like he wasn't truly attentive. \n\nIs it wrong to take notes? Well, taking notes to remember things is common. For example, people might write down important dates or preferences so they don't forget. But the issue here is the wife's perspective. She might have felt that this was a way to game the relationship, making her feel like he's just using a checklist instead of showing authentic care. \n\nAlso, the wife's reaction is about feeling betrayed. She might have thought that if he truly loved her, he would remember these things without needing a list. The almanac could be seen as a crutch, which might imply to her that he can't remember these things on his own, leading to her feeling undervalued or like she needs to be managed. \n\nAnother angle: the author didn't ask her if she was okay with him keeping the almanac. It's possible that by keeping it a secret, he didn't consider her feelings about being documented in that way. Privacy could be a factor. Even though he had good intentions, he didn't communicate with her about it, which might have led to her feeling like her privacy was invaded. \n\nBut then, the author's intention was to be a better partner. He's worried about being the kind of husband who forgets things. The problem arises when his method of remembering things makes the other person feel uncomfortable. The question is whether the action itself (keeping notes) is wrong, or if it's about the lack of communication. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. The wife felt betrayed because she didn't know about the almanac. The author didn't realize that keeping such a personal list might be a sensitive issue. So even though his intention was good, the lack of communication about it led to hurt feelings. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the act of keeping the almanac without discussing it with his wife is the issue, then maybe he is partially responsible. He might have overstepped by documenting private information without her consent, even if it was in a well-meaning way. On the other hand, if a husband keeping notes to remember his wife's preferences isn't inherently wrong, but the wife's reaction is valid due to her feelings, then it's more about their communication issues. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the almanac is a breach of trust. Since he kept it secret and didn't discuss it, and she found out and felt hurt, it's possible that he is in the wrong for not considering her feelings and not being transparent. Alternatively, if the wife's reaction is overreacting, then maybe not. But in this case, the wife's feelings are valid, so the author's action, while well-intentioned, might be the problem. \n\nSo, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he kept the almanac secret without considering her privacy or feelings, leading to her feeling betrayed. Even though his intentions were good, the lack of communication and her discomfort make his actions problematic.\n"
