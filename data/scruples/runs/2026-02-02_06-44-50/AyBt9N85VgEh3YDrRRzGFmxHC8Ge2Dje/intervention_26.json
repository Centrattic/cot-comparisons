She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author created an almanac, which is a notebook where he writes down all sorts of personal information about his wife, like her favorite things and other details he wants to remember. The wife found out and now feels that it's a playbook, which makes her feel betrayed. She's upset and might even destroy the book.\n\nFirst, I should consider the intentions of the author. He says he made it so he could remember important things about his wife and do sweet things for her. That seems like a good intention, right? He's trying to be a thoughtful partner by keeping these notes. But why did the wife react so negatively? Maybe the issue is about transparency and trust. The author kept this secret from his wife for years, not telling her about the notebook. Even though he didn't intend to use it for anything sneaky, the act of keeping it hidden could make her feel like he's not being honest with her. \n\nIn a relationship, both partners need to feel comfortable and respected. If one partner is keeping a significant detail about their relationship private without discussing it, it might lead to feelings of betrayal. The wife might feel that her personal information being documented without her knowledge is an invasion of privacy. Even if it's for good reasons, the fact that it was a secret could be the problem here. \n\nAnother angle is the wife's perspective. She might have expected that her husband would remember these things naturally as part of their relationship. Having a written list could make her feel like he's treating her like a project or a checklist, rather than genuinely engaging with her. It might also make her question the authenticity of his gestures\u2014was he really paying attention, or just following a script from the almanac?\n\nThe author might not see it that way, but the wife's feelings are valid. The key here is communication. The fact that he didn't discuss it with her before creating the almanac could be the main issue. Even if his intentions were good, not involving her in that decision led to her feeling hurt. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions were well-intentioned but he may have overlooked the importance of transparency in the relationship. By keeping the almanac a secret, he didn't consider how she might feel about it, which could lead to the hurt she experienced. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because he didn't communicate his actions and their purpose to her, leading to misunderstanding and hurt feelings.\n"
