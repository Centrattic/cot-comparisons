She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for keeping an almanac with notes about his wife's preferences. The author started this as a way to remember things he might forget, like her favorite flowers, colors, etc. He used it to do sweet things for her over the years. But when she found out, she felt betrayed because she thought he should remember these things without having to write them down. She called it a \"playbook,\" which implies she felt he was using it manipulatively.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The author's intention was genuine; he wanted to show he cared and remembered the details. He didn't share it with anyone, and it wasn't meant to be a secret. However, the problem arises from the wife's perspective. She might have felt that the existence of the almanac suggested he couldn't remember important things about her, which could be a blow to her self-esteem or his perceived commitment. \n\nAlso, when she discovered it, her reaction was negative, feeling that it cheapened the gestures. That's a key point. Even if the intent was good, the outcome was hurt feelings. The author might not have realized that keeping track like this could be seen as a lack of natural effort to remember. \n\nBut then again, the author's reasoning is that he's just trying to be a better partner. He's taking notes so he doesn't forget things. The question is whether this method is wrong. Some people might see it as a kind gesture, while others might see it as insincere if the notes are used instead of genuine memory.\n\nThe wife's reaction is about how she feels. Even if the author had good intentions, she feels betrayed. That's a personal issue that needs to be addressed between them. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to remember, but maybe he missed that the act of writing things down could be perceived negatively. \n\nAnother angle is trust. The wife might have felt that the almanac was a hidden strategy, making her feel like he was using tricks instead of just naturally caring. However, he didn't hide it from her before; she found it herself. Maybe the issue is that she didn't know about it, and the secrecy of the almanac led to mistrust.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author's actions stem from a desire to love and care, but the wife's feelings are valid. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, it depends on whether his actions crossed a line. Since he didn't use it to manipulate or deceive, just to remember, it's more about the wife's feelings. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because his intent was good, but there's a need for communication to address her feelings. However, some might argue that he should have considered her feelings beforehand, making it A. But given the context, the answer is likely B.\n"
