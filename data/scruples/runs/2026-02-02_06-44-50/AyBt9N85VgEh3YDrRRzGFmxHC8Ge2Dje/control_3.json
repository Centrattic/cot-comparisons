She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an almanac with personal notes about his wife. The situation is that he started writing down things about her to remember, like her favorite things, and she found out and felt betrayed, calling it a \"playbook\". The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author created the almanac to remember important details about his wife because he didn't want to forget. He never showed it to anyone and kept it private. The intention was to do sweet things for her, not to use it as a strategy. But when she found out, she felt like it cheapened his gestures and felt betrayed. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's intention, the wife's feelings, and whether the action itself was wrong. The author didn't mean harm; he wanted to show love by remembering. However, the wife's reaction suggests that the method (keeping a private notebook) made her feel like he was using a script instead of genuinely remembering. \n\nIn relationships, transparency and mutual understanding are important. Even though the author had good intentions, the wife wasn't aware of the almanac and its purpose. She might have felt that he wasn't being authentic or that he was keeping something from her that should have been shared. The fact that she called it a \"playbook\" implies she felt he was acting rather than being sincere. \n\nAnother angle is that keeping a notebook to remember personal details isn't inherently wrong. People have different ways of showing love. However, the issue might be that the wife didn't know about it and it made her feel like the gestures weren't genuine. The author might have assumed that his action was a good thing without considering how it could be perceived. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. The author's actions were well-meaning, but the wife's feelings are valid. The problem here is a miscommunication. The author didn't do anything malicious, but the method of keeping a private \"playbook\" might have been a mistake in terms of how it was received. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we go by the wife's feelings and the impact of his actions, he might be partly at fault for not discussing this with her. However, if we focus on his intentions and the lack of malicious intent, he might not be in the wrong. The answer might depend on the perspective. But in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, people often judge based on the outcome and the hurt caused. Since the wife feels betrayed and the author's action led to that, even if unintentionally, he might be considered in the wrong. Alternatively, it could be a misunderstanding where neither is entirely at fault. \n\nBut the key is whether the action itself was wrong. Keeping notes isn't wrong. However, if the wife felt it was inauthentic, maybe the approach was flawed. The author should have discussed this with her earlier to align expectations. Since he didn't and it caused hurt, maybe he's at fault for not considering her perspective. But others might argue that he was trying to be thoughtful and it's the wife overreacting. \n\nI think the majority opinion would be that the author isn't in the wrong because his intentions were good and the action (keeping notes) isn't inherently bad. The problem is the wife's perception and the lack of communication. So the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong). However, some might say that even though the intention was good, the method of keeping a private playbook without discussing it could be seen as manipulative, leading to A. But I think the consensus would lean towards B, as it's a case of differing perspectives rather than the author being wrong.\n"
