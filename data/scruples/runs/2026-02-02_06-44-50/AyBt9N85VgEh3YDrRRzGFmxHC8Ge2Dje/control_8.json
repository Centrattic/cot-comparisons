She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the husband) is in the wrong for having an almanac of personal notes about his wife. The story is that he wrote down things like her favorite colors, books, etc., to remember and do sweet things for her. Now she's upset, feeling it's a \"playbook\" and that he's being insincere.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's intention was to remember important details about his wife because he wanted to be a good partner. He didn't share it with anyone, and he used it to show his love. But his wife feels betrayed, like he's using a script instead of genuinely remembering. \n\nWhy does she feel that way? Maybe she values spontaneity and authenticity. If she thinks he's just reading from a list, it might make her feel like his gestures aren't heartfelt. She might also feel that he didn't trust his own memory, which could imply that he's not fully present in the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's actions stem from a place of love. He wanted to avoid being the forgetful partner, which is a common issue in relationships. The fact that he took the time to document these things shows he cares. However, the key issue here is consent and communication. He didn't discuss this with her before starting the almanac. She might have felt it's an invasion of privacy or that he's reducing her to a list of preferences.\n\nIs there a cultural or societal angle here? Some people might see keeping a list as a sweet gesture, while others might see it as manipulative. The problem is the wife's reaction, which indicates that she values different things. The husband didn't consider her perspective on this matter. Even though his intention was good, the action might have been misguided because it wasn't discussed.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's upset when she wants to destroy it shows he didn't anticipate her reaction. He might need to understand that her feelings are valid even if his intention was pure. The question is whether he's wrong for doing something that's well-meaning but not well-received without prior discussion.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to feel respected and understood. If the wife feels that the almanac is inauthentic, then the husband needs to respect her feelings, even if he doesn't see it the same way. The answer hinges on whether the action, though well-intentioned, crossed into the wife's personal space without her consent or understanding.\n\nSo, the husband isn't in the wrong because he had good intentions, but he might need to adjust his approach. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since his actions, while thoughtful, caused harm, maybe he's partially at fault. But from the options given, the answer is A (yes) or B (no). Considering that he didn't have malicious intent and was trying to be a better partner, but didn't consider her feelings, it's a bit tricky. However, the fact that she's hurt and feels betrayed might mean he's partially in the wrong. But since the options are yes or no, perhaps the answer is B (no), because his intention wasn't to hurt, but the answer could also be A because the action caused harm. Hmm.\n\nWait, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the wife is upset, but his intentions were good, is he in the wrong? In many relationship contexts, actions can be wrong if they hurt the partner, even if unintended. So maybe A. But some might argue that he's not in the wrong because he was trying to be loving. The answer depends on whether intent or consequence matters more. Since the answer is for AITA (I Am The Asshole) style questions, the community often looks at intent and context. If the husband had good intentions and the wife misunderstood, he might not be the asshole. But if the act was a breach of trust, then maybe he is. The key is that he didn't discuss it with her and she felt it was a playbook. So maybe he's not in the wrong because he didn't mean to, but he could have communicated. The answer isn't clear, but given the options, the answer is likely B (No), as the husband is not in the wrong but needs to address the misunderstanding.\n"
