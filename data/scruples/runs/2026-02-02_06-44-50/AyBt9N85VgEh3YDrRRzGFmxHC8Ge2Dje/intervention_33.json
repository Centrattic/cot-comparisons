She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for keeping an Almanac of their wife's preferences and memories. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband started writing down details about his wife's likes, favorites, etc., in a notebook called The Almanac. He did this from the beginning because he wanted to remember things he might forget, like her love for lilacs. Over the years, it became a collection of all these personal details. The wife found the notebook, and she's upset, feeling that it's a \"playbook\" and that he's using it to do sweet things, which cheapens those gestures. Now she's giving him the silent treatment and considering destroying the notebook.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the husband kept a private notebook of his wife's personal information without her knowledge. She felt betrayed and hurt, even though he had good intentions. The author is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide if the husband's actions, though well-intentioned, were a breach of trust or privacy.\n\nFirst, the notebook contains personal information. Even if it's about her, she may not have expected him to document everything in such a detailed way. The act of keeping a private record of her personal details without her knowledge could be seen as intrusive, even if done out of love. Privacy is a big factor here. She might have felt that her personal information was being stored in a way she wasn't comfortable with. \n\nAlso, when he says he never showed it to anyone or mentioned it, that suggests he didn't consider her feelings about it being kept secret. Maybe she would have preferred that he just remembered the things naturally without writing them down. The fact that she found it and it made her feel that his gestures were insincere (because they were planned using the notebook) is a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, his intention was to remember important things about her, which is a thoughtful act. He didn't share it with others, and he used it to make her feel special. But the issue is whether the method (keeping a detailed, secret notebook) was wrong. \n\nTrust and communication are crucial in a relationship. Even if the intention was good, not discussing this with her before could have violated her trust. She might have felt that her personal details were being used in a way she didn't consent to. The term \"playbook\" suggests she felt he was scripting his actions instead of them being spontaneous and genuine. \n\nSo, while the husband had good intentions, the act of keeping a private notebook of her personal information without her knowledge and consent might be seen as crossing a line. The wife's reaction is valid because she felt betrayed and her feelings were hurt. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering her perspective and privacy.\n"
