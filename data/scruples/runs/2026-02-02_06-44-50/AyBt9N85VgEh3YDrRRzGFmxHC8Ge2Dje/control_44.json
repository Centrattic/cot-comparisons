She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for keeping an \"Almanac\" of personal details about his wife. The key points here are the wife's reaction and the author's intentions.\n\nThe author started writing things down because he wanted to remember his wife's preferences, like her love for lilacs. He mentions he did this to avoid forgetting and to do sweet things for her. It seems like his intention was good\u2014to show love and attentiveness. However, his wife found out about the Almanac and felt betrayed, seeing it as a \"playbook\" rather than a genuine effort. She's upset because she thought he remembered things naturally, not because he was relying on notes. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. On one hand, keeping notes to remember important things about a partner isn't inherently wrong. Many people use reminders for important dates or preferences. But the wife's reaction suggests that the act of keeping secrets, even well-meaning ones, made her feel like her personal information was being stored in a way that wasn't transparent. The term \"playbook\" implies she felt he was using a script to impress her, which could feel inauthentic. \n\nThe author didn't lie about the Almanac's existence, but he kept it a secret. The wife might have felt that sharing personal information meant it was supposed to be part of their mutual knowledge, not something he needed to note down. The betrayal she felt could stem from the fact that he had all these details written down without her knowing, making her feel like her trust was violated, even if his intentions were good.\n\nSo, whether he's in the wrong depends on the context of their relationship and communication. If he had discussed the Almanac with her before, maybe she would have understood. But since he kept it a secret, and her reaction is about feeling like her personal details were being used in a way that wasn't genuine, there might be a misunderstanding. The author's intention was to be thoughtful, but the method (keeping it as a secret) led to hurt feelings. \n\nIn relationships, transparency is important. Even if the action is positive, the lack of communication around it can cause issues. So, while the author didn't have malicious intent, the way he kept the Almanac private might have been a misstep. The wife's feelings are valid because she felt the information was being used in a way that wasn't authentic. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the answer could be A (Yes) because the secrecy and lack of communication led to her feeling betrayed, even if the intentions were good.\n"
