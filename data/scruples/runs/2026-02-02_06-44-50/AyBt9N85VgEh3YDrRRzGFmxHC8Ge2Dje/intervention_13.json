She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for keeping the Almanac, which is a notebook with details about his wife. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author, who's married, created a notebook called \"The Almanac\" to remember important things about his wife. He didn't share it with anyone and used it to do sweet things for her. However, his wife found it and is upset, feeling like it's a \"playbook\" and that he's being inauthentic. She's giving him the silent treatment now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's intention was good\u2014he wanted to remember his wife's preferences to show his love. Keeping notes can be a way to stay attentive, especially if someone has a tendency to forget. But his wife's reaction is about feeling betrayed and cheapened. She might feel that he's not being genuine, that he's planning ahead instead of being spontaneous, which could make her feel like his gestures aren't heartfelt but calculated.\n\nCommunication is a big factor here. The author didn't discuss this with his wife before creating the Almanac. Maybe she would have preferred him to remember things naturally or felt that keeping a secret notebook was inconsiderate. Trust and transparency in a relationship are important. If she didn't know about it, she might not have felt respected in how he approached their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have bad intentions. He did it out of love and to avoid being the forgetful partner. The problem is that his wife's feelings are hurt, which matters a lot. Even if his intentions were good, the outcome is that she feels betrayed, so maybe the method was wrong.\n\nAnother angle: some people might find it endearing that he takes such detailed notes, but others might see it as manipulative. It's subjective. The key issue here is the wife's emotional response and the lack of prior communication. The author might have assumed it was a good idea without considering her perspective.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, but the action of keeping something like that secret without discussing it could be a mistake. The responsibility here might be on the author to explain his intentions better and to address his wife's feelings. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he didn't intend harm but caused hurt, it's a gray area. But since the wife's feelings are valid and the author didn't consider her perspective, maybe he is somewhat at fault for not communicating.\n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though his intentions were good, the lack of transparency and the way it made his wife feel are significant. The problem isn't the act of keeping notes but the fact that it caused her distress and he didn't consider her viewpoint beforehand.\n"
