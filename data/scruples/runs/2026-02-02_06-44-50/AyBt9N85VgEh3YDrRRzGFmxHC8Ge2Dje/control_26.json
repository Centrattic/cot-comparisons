She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for having an almanac, a notebook filled with personal details about his wife. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy started writing down things his wife told him\u2014her favorite things, etc.\u2014so he wouldn't forget. He did this over the years, kept it private, and used it to do sweet things for her. Then his wife found it, got upset, and now she's upset, calling it a \"playbook\" and feeling betrayed. The guy is confused because he didn't mean any harm; he thought it showed how much he cared.\n\nSo the key points are: he kept the almanac private, never showed anyone, and used it to remember important things about her. But she feels like it's a play to be good at being a husband, not genuine. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The husband's intention was good; he wanted to remember his wife's preferences to show his love. But the wife's reaction is valid too. Maybe she felt that keeping track of her preferences in a structured way made her feel like he was using a script or not listening to her genuinely. It might make her feel like he's not really present in the relationship, or that he's treating her like a project. \n\nAnother angle: sometimes, when someone does things for another person, the recipient might feel it's insincere if they know the person is keeping track. It could come across as manipulative or as if the actions are rehearsed rather than spontaneous. Even if the intention is good, the wife's feelings are real here. The husband might not have considered how she would perceive the almanac once she found out. It's possible he didn't realize that the act of keeping such a list could make her feel used or like her personal details are being cataloged for a purpose other than genuine affection.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. He used it to make her happy, not to gain any advantage. His actions were from a place of wanting to be a good partner. But the problem is the wife's reaction. The core issue might be about how she felt about his method of showing love versus how he intended it.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband didn't discuss his approach with her, so when she found out, it came as a shock and upset her. Even if his intentions were pure, not explaining why he did it might have led to misunderstanding. She might have felt that he didn't trust himself to remember without notes, which could make her doubt his sincerity.\n\nSo, the question is whether the husband is wrong. If the answer depends on intent versus impact, the impact here is clear\u2014she's hurt and feels betrayed. Even if he didn't mean to, the impact is real. In that case, he might share some responsibility for not considering her feelings. But if the answer is based on intent alone, then he's not in the wrong. But since the question is about being in the wrong, which often includes the effect on the other person, it's possible the answer is A (he is in the wrong) because his actions, though well-intended, caused hurt and he didn't consider her perspective. Alternatively, it could be B (not in the wrong) because his intentions were good and he wasn't malicious.\n\nLooking at similar situations, sometimes people feel that even well-meaning actions can be problematic if they cause emotional harm. The husband's action, while thoughtful, led to the wife feeling that her personal details were being used in a way she didn't agree with. Respecting her feelings and the boundaries she might have about personal information could be important here. The fact that she calls it a \"playbook\" suggests she feels it's a strategy rather than genuine love, which might make her distrust the authenticity of his gestures.\n\nIn conclusion, the husband's intentions are good, but the outcome was hurtful. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the wife is the one who is upset and he didn't foresee the impact, it's a situation where he may not be intentionally wrong, but he is responsible for the impact. Therefore, the answer could be A (he is in the wrong) because he caused emotional harm, even if unintentionally.\n"
