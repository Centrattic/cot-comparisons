She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for keeping an almanac with personal notes about their wife. The situation is that he started writing down her preferences and things she mentioned, intending to remember them for future gestures. His wife found out, and she's upset, feeling like it's a \"playbook\" and that he's using it to manipulate or not being genuine.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is at fault, but wants my opinion. So, first, I need to analyze the intentions vs. the outcome. The author's intention was clearly to remember important things about his wife, which is a good and thoughtful gesture. He didn't share it with anyone, kept it private. But the wife's reaction is negative because she feels it's cheapening their interactions. She might see it as insincere or as him scripting his actions rather than being genuine. \n\nSo, the key points here are trust and transparency. Did the author have the right to keep this secret? The wife didn't know about it, and now that she does, she feels betrayed. Even though his intentions were good, the act of keeping it secret might be the issue. In relationships, sharing things that are meant to be personal can be important. If he had shared the Almanac with her at some point, maybe she would have appreciated the effort. By keeping it hidden, it might come across as manipulative, even if that's not the case.\n\nAnother angle: the wife's perspective. She might feel that having this list of things makes her feel like he's just going through a checklist rather than being spontaneous and truly present. It could make her feel like she's being analyzed or that her preferences are being used. That's a valid feeling. Even if his intent was to remember, the effect on her is negative. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he didn't mean to hurt her, but perhaps he didn't consider how she might feel about the existence of such a document. The act of keeping a secret that's so personal, even if well-intentioned, might have been a mistake. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate his intentions and kept something that's so personal about their relationship without her knowledge. \n\nOn the other hand, he was trying to be thoughtful. But the problem is that the method (keeping a secret) led to her feeling betrayed. In relationships, transparency is key. So, maybe the answer is A: Yes, he is in the wrong because he kept the Almanac a secret and didn't consider her feelings about it being a private record.\n"
