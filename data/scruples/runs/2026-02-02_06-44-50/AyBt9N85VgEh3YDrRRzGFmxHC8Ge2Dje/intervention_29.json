She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about this guy who wrote down all these personal details about his wife in a notebook called \"The Almanac.\" He did this because he wanted to remember things like her favorite colors, books, etc., to do sweet things for her. But when his wife found out, she was upset and felt betrayed, calling it a \"playbook.\" Now, he's wondering if he did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. From the husband's perspective, his intention was good. He wanted to remember things to be thoughtful and caring. He didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. On the other hand, the wife felt that having all these notes made her feel like her partner was using a script, which cheapened the gestures. She might feel that the notes were a bit invasive or that it made the love seem inauthentic.\n\nTrust and transparency are important in relationships. The husband didn't tell her about the Almanac, which could be seen as a breach of trust, even if his intentions were good. Maybe she would have preferred not to be recorded in such a way. The fact that she called it a \"playbook\" suggests she felt he was preparing for a role rather than being genuine. People often value spontaneity and sincerity, so if she felt the gestures were premeditated based on notes, that could hurt her feelings.\n\nAnother angle is privacy. Keeping a detailed record of someone's preferences and personal details without their knowledge might be seen as an invasion of privacy, even if it's done with good intentions. It's possible she would have felt uncomfortable knowing every detail was being documented. The husband might not have considered how she would feel about this and assumed she'd appreciate the effort, which might not be the case.\n\nHowever, the husband's motivation was to remember things and be a better partner. He didn't share it with others, and his actions were meant to show love. But the key issue here might be the lack of communication. If he had talked to her about it earlier, maybe she would have understood his intentions. Now that she's upset, it's about addressing her feelings and maybe explaining his perspective.\n\nIn summary, while the husband's intentions were positive, the execution might have been flawed. The act of keeping such a detailed notebook without her knowledge, even if done with love, could be perceived as a breach of trust or privacy. The wife's reaction is valid because she feels the gestures were less authentic once she realized they were based on notes. So, the husband might be in the wrong for not considering her feelings and not being transparent about his actions. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
