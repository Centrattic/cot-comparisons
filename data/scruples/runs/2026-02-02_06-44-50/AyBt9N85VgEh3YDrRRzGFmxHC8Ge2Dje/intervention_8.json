She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who keeps an \"Almanac\" of notes about his wife's preferences and details. He wrote it all down because he didn't want to forget things like her favorite colors, books, etc., to do sweet things for her. But when his wife found out, she was upset, called it a \"playbook\" and felt betrayed. The guy is confused because he thought it showed he loved her, but now she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy's intention was good\u2014he wanted to remember things to show his love. The act of writing things down might not be inherently wrong, but the reaction from his wife suggests that she felt it was manipulative. The key here is about boundaries and trust. Maybe she felt like he wasn't genuinely trying to remember her, but instead was using a list to impress her. The term \"playbook\" implies that he had a strategy to win her affection, which could make her feel like his affection wasn't sincere but calculated. \n\nCommunication is also a factor here. He didn't discuss this with her before keeping the Almanac, so she didn't have a say in it. Even though he didn't show it to anyone, the act of keeping such detailed notes without her knowledge might have made her feel like she's being analyzed rather than loved for who she is. The betrayal she felt could stem from a lack of transparency. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy didn't have malicious intent. He genuinely wanted to remember things to make her happy. But the problem is that his method of doing so might have backfired. The wife's feelings are valid because she felt that the notes cheapened his gestures. If she felt like the notes were a list of things to do to be nice, rather than a genuine effort, that could hurt her. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we look at AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, the determination often hinges on intent versus the other person's feelings. If the author had bad intentions, he's an asshole. But if his intentions were good but he didn't consider how his actions made her feel, then he's not the asshole, but maybe he's a jerk. However, in this case, the wife felt betrayed, which is a strong emotional response. The author didn't consult her about keeping the Almanac, so he might have overstepped. \n\nBut then again, the act of remembering things is usually seen as caring. The problem is the method. The key is that the wife's feelings are valid. If she felt like the Almanac was a playbook, then the author's approach didn't align with her expectations. Maybe she wanted genuine interactions rather than a rehearsed list. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's intentions were good, but he didn't consider how his actions might be perceived. The wife's reaction is valid, so maybe he's not in the wrong, but he could have handled it differently. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and she feels betrayed, there's a case for him being wrong for keeping the Almanac without discussing it with her first. But since his intent was positive, perhaps he's not in the wrong. Hmm. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong because his intent was good, but he could have communicated better. However, some might argue that he should have respected her feelings more. But given that the wife's reaction is about feeling used, maybe he is in the wrong. Wait, but he didn't use the Almanac to manipulate, he used it to remember. The problem is the way she perceives it. The answer depends on whether actions or intent matter more. In AITA, usually, if intent is good and the other person is upset, it's not the asker's fault. So maybe B (No).\n"
