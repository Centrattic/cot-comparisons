She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for having an almanac of notes about his wife. He started writing down things she mentioned, like her favorite things, to remember and use them for sweet gestures. Now she's upset, calling it a playbook and feeling betrayed.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was good. He wanted to remember details to show his love. But the wife feels like it's a playbook, implying that he's using these notes strategically rather than genuinely remembering from his heart. That could make her feel like he's not truly interested in her but using a script. Even though he didn't mean to, the effect is there. \n\nThe key here is the wife's perspective. The author might not see it as manipulative, but to her, it might feel like he's treating their relationship as a game. Trust is important in a relationship, and if she feels he's keeping secrets or has a hidden \"tool\" for managing their interactions, that could damage her trust. Also, the fact that she found the almanac and reacted strongly suggests that it's a breach of her expectations for honesty and natural connection. \n\nBut the author didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. Maybe he thought it was a personal and caring way to remember her. However, the issue is that he didn't communicate the purpose of the almanac to her. If he had explained how he felt and why he was doing it, maybe she would have understood his intentions. Now, she's hurt because she didn't know about it and felt like he's been using a playbook instead of just naturally remembering. \n\nSo, the problem isn't the act of keeping the almanac itself, but the lack of communication and the wife's perception of it as manipulative. The author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider how she might feel about it and didn't discuss it with her. It's about not being transparent about his actions, even if his intentions were good.\n"
