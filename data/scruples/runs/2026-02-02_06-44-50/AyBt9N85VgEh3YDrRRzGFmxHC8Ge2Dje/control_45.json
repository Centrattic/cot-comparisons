She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an \"Almanac\" of notes about his wife's preferences and details. \n\nFirst, the backstory: The couple met in 2008, and the author started writing down things like her favorite colors, restaurants, etc., to remember them. The wife found the notebook, felt betrayed, and now it's causing conflict.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's intention was to remember important things about his wife to show his love and avoid being the forgetful partner. He kept it private, never showed it to anyone. The wife's reaction is that it's a \"playbook\" and she feels cheapened by all the sweet things he did, leading her to feel betrayed.\n\nNow, to assess if he's in the wrong. The main issue here is consent and transparency. He didn't share the existence of the Almanac with her, so she didn't know about it. Even though his intentions were good, keeping such a personal record without her knowledge might have crossed a boundary she didn't expect. \n\nIn relationships, sometimes what one person sees as thoughtful, the other might view as intrusive or manipulative. The wife's feeling that her memories and preferences are being reduced to a checklist for him to follow could be hurtful. The term \"playbook\" suggests she feels like he's using a strategy to earn her affection, which might not align with her view of genuine love and spontaneity.\n\nBut then again, the author's perspective is that he wanted to remember details to show his love. He didn't have malicious intent. The problem is that he kept it secret. If he had shared this practice with her earlier, maybe she would have appreciated it more. The secrecy here might be key. \n\nAnother angle: The Almanac, while well-intentioned, might have made her feel objectified. If he's listing her preferences as a collection of items, maybe she feels like he's treating her as a set of data points rather than a person with evolving thoughts and feelings. That could lead to feeling cheapened.\n\nSo, the author isn't malicious, but the lack of communication and the wife's emotional reaction suggest that this is a mistake in how he handled it. The answer might hinge on whether keeping such a private record without discussing it with a partner is considered wrong. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) logic, sometimes the answer is about perception rather than right or wrong. The wife's feelings are valid, so even if the author didn't mean to, his actions caused her pain, which makes him at least partially responsible. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes), because he should have been more open about his actions, even if his intentions were good.\n"
