She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for keeping an Almanac of his wife's preferences and personal details. \n\nFirst, the context: The author started writing down things his wife mentioned about her likes, such as her favorite color, books, etc., to remember them and do sweet things for her. He didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. However, when his wife found it, she felt betrayed and called it a \"playbook,\" feeling that it cheapened his gestures. He's now worried she might destroy it and is facing the silent treatment.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn the author's side, his intention was to remember important things about his wife to show his love and avoid being the type of husband who forgets. He didn't share it with others, and the almanac was a personal effort to be attentive. His actions were driven by love and a desire to be a good partner.\n\nHowever, from the wife's perspective, she felt that having a written list of her preferences made her feel like the gestures were rehearsed or inauthentic. She might have wanted spontaneity and genuine care rather than something that felt scripted. The fact that she hadn't noticed the almanac before and now feels betrayed suggests that keeping such a private record might have crossed a boundary she wasn't comfortable with. Even though the intention was good, the execution led to her discomfort.\n\nCommunication seems to be a key factor here. The author didn't discuss his method of remembering things with his wife, which led to misunderstanding. If he had explained his intentions to her earlier, maybe she would have understood. But since he kept it a secret, and she found out in a way that felt intrusive, the reaction is based on a lack of transparency.\n\nThe almanac, while well-meaning, might have made her feel objectified or as if her preferences were being cataloged for someone else's use rather than being part of a mutual, spontaneous relationship. The wife's reaction indicates that the method of documentation, regardless of intention, caused emotional distress. The author's mistake wasn't in wanting to remember but in how he chose to do it without considering her feelings about being documented in that way.\n\nSo, while the intentions were good, the action of creating a written record without her knowledge and consent likely made her feel disrespected or undervalued. The author should have been more open about his approach and might have realized that his method, though well-intentioned, was not the right way to express his care in this case.\n"
