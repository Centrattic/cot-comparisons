She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The situation is about whether keeping an Almanac (a notebook with personal notes about his wife) is wrong. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong (AITA). \n\nFirst, the author explains that he started the Almanac to remember things about his wife, like her favorite flowers, colors, etc. He did this because he didn't want to forget these details and wanted to do sweet things for her. He kept it private for years, never showed it to anyone, and called it his way of showing love.\n\nThen, when his wife found it, she was upset. She thought he remembered these things naturally, and now she feels like he's using the Almanac as a \"playbook,\" which made her feel betrayed. She might even destroy it. The author is hurt because he thought this was a loving gesture, not something that would make her feel that way.\n\nSo the main conflict is about whether keeping such a notebook is a genuine expression of love or a manipulative tactic. The wife's reaction suggests she values authenticity and maybe feels the notes are insincere because they're written down. The author, on the other hand, sees it as a way to remember important things and be a better partner.\n\nFrom a perspective of intentions, the author's actions were meant to be loving, but the effect was hurtful. However, the wife's feelings are valid because she felt the gesture was inauthentic. The question is whether the author was wrong. If the action, despite good intentions, caused emotional harm because it made her feel manipulated, then maybe he is in the wrong. But if the intention was purely to remember and show love, and the wife's reaction is about her discomfort with being documented, then maybe he's not.\n\nBut in relationships, transparency and mutual comfort are important. The fact that he kept it a secret for so long might have contributed to her feeling that he wasn't genuine in his remembrance. Also, the term \"playbook\" implies a strategy, which she might see as him treating their relationship as a game. Even if he didn't mean it that way, her perspective is valid. So maybe the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider how his wife might feel about being documented in this way, even if his intentions were good. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because his action, while well-meaning, caused hurt and the issue is about respecting the other's feelings and the perception in the relationship.\n"
