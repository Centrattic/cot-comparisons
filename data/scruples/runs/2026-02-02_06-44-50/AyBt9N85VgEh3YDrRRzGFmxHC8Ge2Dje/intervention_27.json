She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an almanac of notes about his wife. The author started keeping the almanac to remember important details about his wife, like her favorite things, to do sweet things for her. He didn't share it with anyone until his wife found it. She's upset, feeling like it's a playbook and that he's using it to manipulate the relationship, which makes her feel betrayed.\n\nHmm, the author's intention was good. He wanted to remember things to show he cares. But the wife's reaction is about feeling like he's treating the relationship like a script. Maybe she feels it's inauthentic, that he's not genuinely remembering but just following a list. It might make her feel like he's not truly present in the relationship. The key here is the difference between intention vs. impact. The author didn't mean to hurt her, but his actions caused hurt. \n\nIs keeping a list inherently wrong? Maybe not, but the wife's feelings are valid. Trust is important in a relationship, and if she perceives it as a manipulation tool, that's a problem. The author didn't consider her perspective. Also, the fact that he kept it a secret might contribute to her feeling of betrayal. Even if it was for good reasons, not sharing it could make her feel like he's keeping things from her that are relevant to their relationship. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong not because of the act of keeping notes, but because the notes were kept secret and they were perceived as manipulative. The issue is about how the wife feels and the lack of communication. The author should have discussed his reasons with her, maybe, to prevent misunderstanding. Since the wife is feeling betrayed and the action caused harm regardless of the intention, the author might be at fault here.\n"
