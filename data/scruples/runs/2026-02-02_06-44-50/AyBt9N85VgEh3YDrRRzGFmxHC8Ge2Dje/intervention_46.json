She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the husband has been keeping a notebook called The Almanac, where he writes down all sorts of personal details about his wife. He did this to remember things he wanted to do for her, like her favorite things. But when she found out, she felt betrayed and called it his \"playbook,\" which made her feel cheapened by his actions.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about trust, privacy, and how each person perceives the intent behind the action. The husband didn't have any bad intentions; he wanted to be a good partner by remembering important details. However, the wife's reaction suggests that she felt her personal information wasn't respected. Even though he didn't share it with anyone, keeping such a detailed record might have made her feel like he was using her personal data for his own purposes, rather than truly engaging with her in the moment.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The husband didn't discuss this with her before starting the Almanac. Maybe he should have considered her feelings about being documented. Even if his intention was good, the act of keeping such a notebook could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if she didn't know about it. The wife's feeling of betrayal indicates that she values privacy and spontaneity, whereas the husband values remembering details to show his love.\n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong depends on perspective. If the wife felt her privacy was invaded, then the husband might be in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries. On the other hand, if the husband's actions were purely out of love and he didn't intend to make her feel used, then maybe he isn't in the wrong. But the problem is that his actions led to her feeling this way, regardless of his intent. In relationships, intent matters, but so does the impact. Since the wife is hurt and feels betrayed, the author might be in the wrong for not considering her feelings and privacy.\n"
