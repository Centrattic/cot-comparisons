She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for keeping an Almanac of information about his wife. The situation is that he created a notebook where he writes down details about her preferences, like her favorite things, to remember and do sweet things for her. His wife found out, got upset, and now he's wondering if he did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was clearly to remember important things about his wife because he loves her. He didn't want to be the type of husband who forgets her favorite things. That seems like a positive motivation. However, the wife feels that the existence of the Almanac \"cheapened\" the sweet things he did for her, calling it a \"playbook\" and feeling betrayed. She might feel that keeping track of these details in this way is somehow insincere or manipulative, even if it's not intended that way.\n\nThe key points here are consent and perspective. The author didn't share the Almanac with her or anyone else, but by keeping it a secret, he might have violated her trust without realizing it. She might have expected that the effort he put into remembering her preferences was genuine and spontaneous, rather than written down in a system. The fact that she found out and reacted this way suggests that there's a misunderstanding about how she values the effort versus the method.\n\nAnother angle is about privacy. The Almanac contains personal information about her, and even though it's for a good reason, she might feel that she didn't consent to having her personal details recorded in this way. It's possible she feels it's an invasion of her privacy, even if it's done with good intentions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions were meant to show love and attentiveness. He did document things to remember them, which is a common practice for many people. The problem arises when his wife interprets this as a playbook, which could imply that his actions were calculated rather than heartfelt. The emotional impact is significant here\u2014she's dejected and feels betrayed, which indicates that his actions, while well-intentioned, have caused her distress.\n\nIt's important to consider communication. The author might not have realized that his wife would feel this way. Maybe he should have discussed the Almanac with her earlier to ensure that she felt comfortable with it. The fact that he kept it a secret until she found it herself might have contributed to her negative reaction.\n\nIn relationships, transparency and mutual understanding are crucial. Even if the author's intentions are good, if his wife interprets the action negatively, then there's a problem that needs addressing. The author is now in a difficult position where he has to reconcile his good intentions with her feelings of betrayal.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because his intentions were positive. However, the way he executed his actions (keeping it secret and not discussing it with her) might have led to the misunderstanding. The fault here isn't entirely his, but he might need to adjust his approach to better align with his wife's feelings and expectations. Therefore, the answer would be that he's not in the wrong (B), but there's a need for communication and understanding between both partners.\n"
