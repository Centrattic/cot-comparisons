She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who kept an almanac with personal details about his wife, which he used to remember things and do sweet things for her. His wife found out and now feels betrayed, calling it a \"playbook.\" The author is asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's intention was good\u2014he wanted to remember important things about his wife because he loves her. He didn't share it with anyone, kept it private. But his wife was hurt by it. Why? Maybe she felt that keeping track of her preferences in such a detailed way was manipulative or that he wasn't being genuine. Maybe she felt like he's treating their relationship like a script, using it to earn her affection instead of being authentic.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband didn't have malicious intent. He believed he was showing love by remembering things. The problem here might be a miscommunication or differing expectations. The wife's reaction is valid because she's upset and feels betrayed. Even if his intentions were good, she might see it as a violation of privacy or intimacy. The key question is whether keeping the almanac crossed a line, even if done with good intentions.\n\nAnother angle: in relationships, trust is crucial. If the wife never knew about the almanac and it was kept secret, maybe she felt like her partner wasn't transparent. However, he didn't hide it intentionally; he just didn't think about sharing it. But once she found out, her feelings were hurt. The husband might be in the wrong because he didn't consider that keeping such a detailed record could make her feel like she's being analyzed or that his love is conditional on keeping track of things.\n\nBut then again, some people might argue that he's just trying to be a considerate partner. The issue here is whether the method (keeping an almanac) was wrong. The wife's feeling of betrayal suggests that she values spontaneity and genuine remembrance over something that feels rehearsed. The husband's actions, while well-meaning, might have come across as insincere from her perspective.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer hinges on whether the husband's actions, despite good intentions, caused harm. In relationships, actions that make a partner feel uneasy or untrusted can be problematic. The wife's emotional response is valid, and the husband may need to reflect on why his approach led to her feeling that way. Therefore, the answer might be that he is in the wrong (A) because his actions, even if well-intentioned, hurt his wife's feelings and created a sense of betrayal.\n"
