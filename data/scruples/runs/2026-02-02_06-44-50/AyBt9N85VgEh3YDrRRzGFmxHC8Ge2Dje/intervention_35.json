She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, he created this \"Almanac\" to remember personal details about his wife because he wanted to show his love and not forget things like her favorite flowers. But now she feels betrayed and thinks it's a playbook, which makes her feel like he's just going through a list to impress her. \n\nFirst, the intention here is key. He says he did it out of love, to remember things he would otherwise forget. That seems genuine. But maybe the issue is that he kept it a secret. He didn't mention it to her before, even though she thought he remembered those things naturally. So when she saw the notebook, it felt like he was using a script instead of genuinely caring.\n\nBut why would she feel that way? Maybe she values spontaneity and feels that having a written list makes the gestures feel less personal and more calculated. It's possible that she wanted him to remember without needing notes, seeing it as a lack of effort or maybe even a lack of trust in his memory. \n\nAlso, the fact that he kept it secret might have made her feel like he wasn't being transparent. Even if his intentions were good, not sharing this with her could have led to misunderstandings. She might have felt that he was hiding something or manipulating the situation without her knowing. \n\nOn the other hand, he never showed it to anyone else, which shows he cared about her privacy. But maybe the problem is that he didn't communicate his actions to her. If he had mentioned that he writes things down to remember, she might have understood his reasoning. Instead, her discovery of it made her feel like he was keeping a secret, which can lead to feelings of betrayal even if there's no malicious intent. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, the act of keeping the Almanac itself isn't necessarily wrong, but the secrecy around it might be. If he had been open about it, maybe she wouldn't have felt the way she did. The key here is transparency in a relationship. Even with good intentions, not discussing such a personal project with his wife could have caused unnecessary hurt. \n\nTherefore, maybe the author is partly at fault because he didn't communicate his reasons to her. Even if he meant well, the lack of openness contributed to her negative reaction. So the answer would be A, he is in the wrong.\n"
