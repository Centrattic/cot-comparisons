She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the person who wrote the Almanac is in the wrong. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the provided situation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author created a notebook called The Almanac where he wrote down personal details about his wife\u2014her likes, favorites, things he wanted to remember to do nice things for her. But his wife found it and felt betrayed, thinking he was using it as a \"playbook\" instead of just remembering from heart. She's upset and considering destroying it.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about intent and perception. The author's intention was to remember important things about his wife because he loves her and wants to be attentive. He didn't share it with anyone, kept it private, and used it to do sweet things. However, his wife's reaction is that it made her feel like he wasn't genuine, that he was using a list instead of naturally remembering, which led to her feeling cheapened and betrayed.\n\nSo, is it wrong? Well, the author didn't have malicious intent. He was trying to be a good husband. But maybe the issue is about how his actions affected his wife. Even if his intention was good, if it made her feel uncomfortable or like he wasn't being authentic, then perhaps he should have considered that. The problem might be that he didn't communicate his reasons to her, so she misunderstood. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, not just whether there's a misunderstanding.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to consider how your actions are perceived. Even if his actions were well-meaning, if they caused hurt, then there's a responsibility to address that. However, the author isn't intentionally trying to hurt her; he's genuinely confused and hurt by her reaction. The wife's feelings are valid, so maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he didn't mean harm, but perhaps he should have been more aware of how it might be received.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer depends on cultural or social norms. Some might say no because he was trying to be thoughtful. Others might say yes because keeping a private list could be seen as not trusting his own memory or being genuine. But from a relationship perspective, the key is communication. If he had explained his reasons, maybe she wouldn't be upset. But since he didn't, maybe he's at least partially responsible for her hurt feelings.\n\nHowever, the wife's reaction might be overreacting if the author's intent was purely good. But her feelings are real. The answer could be that he's not in the wrong (B), but he needs to address her feelings. However, the options are A (yes) or B (no). So, if the question is whether he's in the wrong, considering that he didn't have bad intentions, the answer might be B. But if the wrongness is about the outcome, then maybe A. But typically, in AITA (Am I the Asshole) contexts, the emphasis is on intent. Since he didn't mean to hurt her, and his actions were well-intentioned, the answer is B. However, if the act itself is considered wrong regardless of intent, then A. But in most cases, the intent matters. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. He should talk to his wife to explain, but he isn't the asshole for having the Almanac.\n"
