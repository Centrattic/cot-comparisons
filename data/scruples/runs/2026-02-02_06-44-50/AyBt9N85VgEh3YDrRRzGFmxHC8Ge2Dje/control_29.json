She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he created this \"Almanac\" of notes about his wife's preferences and stuff. He used it to remember things so he could do sweet things for her. But now she's upset, calling it a \"playbook\" and feeling betrayed. He didn't show it to anyone else, and he's confused why she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand why she's upset. She said the Almanac cheapened every sweet thing he did. Maybe she feels like he's being insincere, that the gestures aren't genuine because they're planned from a list. Or maybe she feels like he's keeping secrets, even though he didn't mean to. She mentioned she always thought he remembered things naturally, so maybe she feels like he's not really paying attention or that he's manipulative.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to show his love by remembering important things. He thought he was doing the right thing, and he kept it private. He didn't share it with others, and it was all for their relationship. He's confused and heartbroken because she's upset. \n\nSo the question is, is he wrong for keeping this notebook? Well, did he do anything harmful? He didn't use it to hurt her. He used it to make their relationship better. But maybe the issue is about trust and transparency. Even though he didn't mean to, keeping such a private collection without her knowledge might make her feel like he's not being authentic. If she feels like the gestures are just from a list, that could make her feel unappreciated in a different way. \n\nBut then again, the act of remembering things is a good thing. If he didn't have the notebook, he might forget. The problem might be more about her perception. Maybe she values spontaneity or feels that genuine memory is better than written notes. However, the fact that she's upset and feeling betrayed is a key point. Even if his intentions were good, if his actions caused her emotional harm, maybe he's in the wrong. \n\nWait, but is it his fault that he needs a notebook to remember? People have different ways of showing love. Maybe he's being accused of inauthenticity. But is that a valid reason? If he's trying his best to remember and it's causing issues, is there a communication problem? Maybe he should have talked to her about the notebook earlier. But the article says he never told anyone about it, not even his wife. So maybe the secrecy is the issue here. If he had shared it with her when he made it, maybe she wouldn't have felt this way. \n\nSo the root problem might be about not being transparent. He kept it a secret, even though it's about their relationship. By not discussing it with her, he might have violated her trust, even if unintentionally. She might feel that something so personal about her was being documented without her knowledge. \n\nAlternatively, if he had mentioned it to her before, maybe she would have appreciated the effort. But since he didn't, and now she's upset, maybe he's in the wrong for not being open about his methods. \n\nBut then again, he didn't use the information in a harmful way. He used it to do sweet things. So maybe she's overreacting? But the fact that she's feeling betrayed is a valid emotion. So the answer depends on whether his actions crossed a line, even with good intentions. \n\nIn relationships, intentions matter, but so do the effects. If his actions made her feel unappreciated or manipulated, then maybe he's in the wrong. However, if his intention was purely to love her and it's just a misunderstanding, then maybe not. \n\nI think the key points are the secrecy and the perception. By not being open about the Almanac, even if he didn't mean to, he might have made her feel like he wasn't being genuine. So the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because the issue is about how his actions affected her, not just his intentions. Alternatively, if the problem is her overreaction, then B (not in the wrong). But since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, and the answer depends on the perspective. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person did something that's objectively wrong or not. Here, keeping a notebook isn't inherently wrong. But if it's causing harm and he didn't communicate his reasons, maybe he's not in the wrong. The problem is his wife's feelings, but if he had good intentions, maybe he's not at fault. However, maybe he should have discussed it with her. \n\nHmm. I'm a bit torn. But the fact that he kept it secret might be the main issue. Even if it's for a good reason, not involving her in that decision could be problematic. So maybe A. But others might say B because his intentions were good. I'm not sure. \n\nAnother angle: Did he use the information in a way that's manipulative or controlling? No, he used it to do sweet things. So maybe B. The problem is her perception, but it's not his fault. So he's not in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B. He's not in the wrong because his actions were well-intentioned and not harmful, even if they caused unintended emotional distress. The responsibility might be on her to communicate her feelings. So the answer would be B.\n"
