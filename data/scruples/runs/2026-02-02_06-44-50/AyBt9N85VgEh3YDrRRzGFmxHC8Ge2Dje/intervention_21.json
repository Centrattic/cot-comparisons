She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a man who kept a notebook called \"The Almanac\" where he wrote down personal details about his wife\u2014her favorite things, etc. He did this so he wouldn't forget and to do sweet things for her. But when she found it, she was upset, feeling he had cheapened the gestures and used it as a playbook, leading to betrayal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's intention was good; he wanted to remember things to show his love. But the wife's reaction is about feeling that the gestures were insincere because they came from a written list. Maybe she felt he wasn't genuinely paying attention to her, but instead relying on a checklist. That could make her feel like he's not truly listening or being present in the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband argues that he remembered naturally from the notes and that he never shared it. But the key point might be about the perception. In relationships, actions often matter more than intentions. If the wife believes that the sweet gestures were calculated and not spontaneous, it might undermine her trust and feelings of being loved authentically. \n\nAlso, the wife's emotional response is significant. She's dejected, giving the silent treatment, and considering destroying it. That shows the impact it's had on her. The husband might have thought keeping notes was helpful, but maybe he should have asked her about her thoughts on this method. Maybe she preferred if he remembered without needing to write it down, seeing it as a sign of not being able to retain her preferences. \n\nThere's a part where the husband mentions he's terrified she might burn it because he wants to remember those details. But if she feels it's a betrayal, then the problem isn't just the notebook itself, but how it's perceived. The question is whether the husband should have considered how she might react, even if his intention was good. \n\nI think the answer is tricky. If the wife hadn't been upset, it's probably seen as a sweet gesture. But since she is, he should take responsibility for not understanding her feelings. It's not necessarily that he's wrong for wanting to remember, but maybe the way he did it made her feel less valued. So, the author (the husband) might be in the wrong because the action, although well-meaning, caused hurt feelings and the wife's perspective is valid.\n"
