She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for keeping an almanac of personal details about his wife. The key points here are about the wife's reaction and the author's intentions.\n\nFirst, the author started the almanac to remember important things about his wife, like her favorite things. He did this out of love and to avoid being the type of partner who forgets important details. He didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. The wife found the almanac and felt betrayed, calling it a \"playbook\" that made his gestures feel cheap. She's upset and considering destroying it.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Intentions matter here. His intent was to show love and remember important things, which is positive. However, the problem arises from the wife's perspective. The act of keeping notes might have been seen as insincere or manipulative to her. Even though he didn't mean it that way, the wife's feelings are valid. The issue might be that the almanac, while well-intentioned, could make her feel like he's calculating or not genuine in his gestures. \n\nIn relationships, transparency and communication are key. The author didn't realize that keeping such a detailed record might make her feel uncomfortable. It's possible that she values spontaneous, heartfelt actions rather than planned ones based on a list. The fact that she didn't know about the almanac until now could be a breach of trust from her viewpoint, even if it wasn't intentional. \n\nThere's also the aspect of trust and how actions are perceived. If she feels that his actions are part of a \"playbook,\" it might diminish the authenticity she expects in a relationship. The author needs to understand that her feelings are valid and that the method he used to express love isn't resonating with her. \n\nSo, while the author's intentions were good, the outcome is that his wife feels hurt and betrayed. Therefore, he might be at fault not for the act of keeping notes, but for not considering how she might perceive it. The answer here is likely A (Yes) because the wife's feelings are valid, and the author didn't anticipate how his actions might be misinterpreted, leading to her distress.\n"
