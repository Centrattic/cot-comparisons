She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for keeping a secret notebook called \"The Almanac\" with personal notes about his wife. The wife found out and is upset, feeling betrayed because she thought he remembered things about her naturally, not from a list.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons behind the author's actions. He started the Almanac to remember important details about his wife, like her favorite things, to do sweet things for her. He didn't share it with others and kept it private. His intention was good\u2014to show love and effort by remembering things. However, the wife interprets it as a playbook, meaning she feels like he's only doing these things because he has a list, not from genuine memory or care. \n\nNow, the key points here are consent and communication. The author didn't tell his wife about the Almanac, so she didn't know it existed. The issue might be that she expected him to remember things organically, which he did, but the existence of a written list makes her feel like it's not sincere. Even though his intention was good, the secrecy and the way it was discovered might have made her feel like he was keeping secrets or treating their relationship in a transactional way. \n\nOn the other hand, keeping a personal journal is a common way for people to remember things. The author didn't use the information in a harmful way; he used it to do nice things. But the wife's feelings are valid. If she feels like her husband's gestures are insincere because they come from a list, that's a problem in their communication. The author might need to explain his intentions and reassure her that the effort is genuine, even if it's documented.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the action of keeping the Almanac itself isn't inherently wrong, but the lack of transparency might be. The wife's reaction shows that the act of keeping a secret list, even with good intentions, can be perceived as inauthentic. The author should have discussed the Almanac with his wife to avoid misunderstandings. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because the intent was positive, but he could have been more open. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer might be B (No) because his intentions were good, but maybe there's a middle ground. However, the options are A or B. Since the wife's feelings are valid and the lack of communication is an issue, but the action itself isn't malicious, the answer is B. He's not in the wrong, but needs to communicate better.\n"
