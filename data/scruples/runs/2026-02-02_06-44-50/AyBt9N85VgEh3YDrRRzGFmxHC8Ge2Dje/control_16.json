She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking about a situation where the husband created an \"Almanac\" with notes about his wife's preferences and personal details. His wife found it and now feels betrayed, calling it a \"playbook\" and feeling like the sweet gestures were cheapened.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions. The husband started writing down things his wife told him because he wanted to remember important details about her. He mentions he did this to avoid forgetting and to do sweet things for her. His motivation seems genuine, coming from a place of love and wanting to be attentive. That's a positive point for him.\n\nHowever, the wife's reaction is negative. She feels that having an almanac of notes makes the sweet gestures insincere. She might feel that he's not genuinely paying attention but is instead relying on a list. That's a common concern in relationships\u2014people sometimes prefer feeling that their partner is naturally attentive rather than following a script. \n\nAnother angle is the surprise factor. The husband didn't mention the almanac before, and the wife found it without him telling her. The secrecy might have contributed to her feeling betrayed. Even though he didn't share it with others, keeping it hidden from her could imply that he didn't trust her or didn't think she'd understand his intentions. \n\nThe key here is perspective. The husband sees it as a loving effort to remember important things, while the wife sees it as a manipulative playbook. The problem arises from the wife's interpretation of the almanac as inauthentic. The husband's actions, while well-meaning, might have unintentionally crossed a line by not discussing it with her earlier. \n\nIn relationships, transparency is important. If the husband had shared his approach with her, maybe she'd understand his intent better. But since he didn't, and she found out in a way that made her feel like he was using a list to win her affection, her feelings of betrayal are valid. \n\nSo, the husband's actions aren't malicious, but the lack of communication and the wife's feelings of being used or not being genuinely appreciated might mean that he is in the wrong from her perspective. However, intentions matter. If his intentions are purely good, then the fault might not be entirely his. But since the outcome is causing her distress, he might need to reconsider how he approaches remembering her preferences without making it feel like a script.\n"
