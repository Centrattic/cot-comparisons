She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong regarding the Almanac. The situation is that the author created a notebook with personal details about his wife to remember them, but when she found out, she felt betrayed and called it a \"playbook,\" making her feel like the sweet gestures were insincere.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The author's intention was good\u2014he wanted to remember his wife's preferences because he loves her and doesn't want to be the forgetful type. He didn't share it with anyone, and he thought it was a private, loving gesture. However, his wife's reaction is also valid. She might feel that the existence of the Almanac undermines the authenticity of his actions. If he's using a list to make sure he remembers, maybe she feels he's not genuinely paying attention or that his actions are rehearsed rather than heartfelt. \n\nI should consider communication here. The author didn't discuss the Almanac with his wife, assuming she would appreciate it. But his wife had different feelings. It's possible that keeping such a private notebook without her knowing could make her feel like there's a hidden part of his life she's not privy to. Trust can be affected if one partner keeps secrets, even if they're well-meaning. \n\nAnother angle is the concept of autonomy in a relationship. The wife might value spontaneity and genuine effort over pre-planned gestures. If she feels like every action is coming from a list, it might make her think he's not being present. The author, on the other hand, might feel like he's trying his best to be attentive, which he should be commended for. \n\nIt's also important to consider cultural or societal norms. Some people might see keeping such a notebook as sweet and thoughtful, while others find it manipulative or inauthentic. The key is the wife's perspective here. Since the wife is hurt and feels betrayed, the author's actions, though not malicious, might be causing emotional harm.\n\nBut then again, the author might not have intended to hurt her. He might not understand why she's upset because he sees it as a positive thing. Miscommunication could be the root cause here. The author should probably talk to her to understand her feelings better and see if there's a way to reconcile their perspectives. \n\nIn terms of fault, is the author in the wrong for keeping the Almanac, or is it just a misunderstanding? If his intention was genuine and the wife's feelings were hurt without his knowledge, then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if keeping the Almanac without her knowledge and the way he uses it (as a playbook) is something she finds disrespectful, then he might be at fault for not considering her feelings. \n\nI think the key points are: the author's intention was good, but he didn't consider how his wife might perceive it. By keeping it secret, he didn't give her a chance to express her discomfort. The woman has the right to feel that her partner's gestures should come from a place of spontaneity and not premeditated notes. So, while the author's actions were well-meaning, he might be in the wrong for not communicating and for the way the Almanac made his wife feel. Therefore, the answer could be A, but I'm a bit torn because intentions are good.\n"
