She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the husband) is in the wrong for having an almanac where he wrote down personal details about his wife.\n\nThe husband started the almanac after meeting his wife, writing down things like her favorite flowers, colors, restaurants, etc. He used it to remember important things to do sweet things for her. But now his wife is upset, calling it a \"playbook\" and feeling betrayed. She feels like it cheapens his gestures and is considering destroying it.\n\nThe question is whether he's at fault here. The options are A or B. I need to decide based on the situation.\n\nFirst, his intention was good. He wanted to remember things to show his love, which is a positive motive. However, the issue might be that he didn't consider her feelings about being documented. Even though he kept it private, keeping a detailed notebook about someone without discussing it with them might be an invasion of privacy from her perspective. She might feel that he's reducing her to a list of traits or preferences, using them as a script, which could make her feel objectified or not genuinely loved for who she is.\n\nOn the other hand, his actions were meant to be caring. The problem arises from the interpretation. He didn't share it with others, but the act of documenting personal details without her knowledge might have crossed a boundary. Trust and communication are key in relationships. She didn't know about it, and when she found out, she felt betrayed. That suggests that even if his intentions were good, not discussing it with her first was a mistake.\n\nSo, maybe the husband is in the wrong because he didn't consider her feelings about his method of showing love. Even with good intentions, actions that make a partner feel uncomfortable or disrespected can be problematic. The fact that she's upset and feels it's a playbook implies that she values authenticity over premeditated gestures. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't communicate his actions, leading to her hurt feelings.\n"
