She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for having an Almanac, which is a notebook where they wrote down personal details about their wife. The key points here are about intentions and how the wife felt.\n\nThe author started the Almanac to remember things about his wife that he might forget, like her favorite things. He mentions he did it because he wanted to do sweet things for her. But when she found out, she felt betrayed and thought it was a playbook. Now, the question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the author's intention was loving and thoughtful. He wanted to show his care by remembering important details. On the other hand, the wife's reaction suggests that the existence of the notebook made her feel like he was using her or keeping a list for his own purposes. Maybe she felt it was an invasion of privacy or that it reduced her to a list of traits. The fact that she called it a \"playbook\" implies she saw it as manipulative or strategy-based, which the author didn't intend.\n\nIt's possible that the action itself isn't inherently wrong, but the way it made the wife feel is important. The author didn't mean to hurt her, but he should have considered how she might perceive it. Maybe he should have discussed it with her before keeping such a detailed record. The problem here might be communication. The author's mistake could be not discussing the notebook with her, leading to misunderstanding. Since the wife's feelings are hurt, even if the intention was good, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider her perspective. So the answer might be A (he's in the wrong), but I'm a bit torn because the intention was good. However, the impact on her feelings matters more. So I think the answer is A.\n"
