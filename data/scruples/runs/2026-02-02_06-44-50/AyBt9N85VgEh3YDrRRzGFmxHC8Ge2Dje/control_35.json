She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for keeping an almanac with personal notes about his wife. The key points are:\n\n1. **Intent**: The author created the almanac to remember important details about his wife because he wanted to remember her preferences and do sweet things for her. His intention was genuine, driven by love and wanting to avoid being forgetful.\n\n2. **Secrecy**: He never told his wife about the almanac and didn't show it to anyone. She found it unexpectedly, which might have led to her feeling betrayed because he didn't share this part of his affection with her.\n\n3. **Reaction**: The wife is upset because she felt the almanac cheapened the gestures. She might have felt that the notes were a \"playbook\" instead of genuine remembrance, leading to feelings of betrayal and hurt. Her emotional response is valid as she perceives his actions as insincere.\n\n4. **Communication**: The author didn't communicate his reasons for keeping the almanac. Even if his intent was good, not discussing it with his wife could have led to misunderstandings. Trust and transparency are important in relationships, so keeping such a personal item secret might have been a misstep.\n\n5. **Emotional Impact**: The wife's reaction indicates that the method of remembering (writing it down) affected her perception negatively. The author's actions, though well-meaning, caused hurt, which is significant in determining fault.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's actions were not malicious, but the lack of communication and the wife's hurt feelings suggest that the approach had flaws. While the intent was good, the secrecy and the way it was discovered contributed to the conflict. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility, but it's a nuanced situation. However, based on the wife's emotional reaction and the importance of mutual understanding in relationships, the author is likely at fault to some extent.\n"
