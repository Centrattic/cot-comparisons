She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he wrote down all these personal details about his wife in a notebook called The Almanac. He did this to remember her favorites and other things so he could do sweet things for her. Then he found out she got upset when she found his notebook. She felt like it cheapened his gestures and called it a \"playbook,\" making her feel betrayed.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about intent versus perception. His intention was good\u2014he wanted to remember things to make her feel loved. But she felt that having it written down made it seem insincere, like he was just following a script. That's a tough spot. \n\nIn relationships, trust and how each person feels about actions are really important. Even if his actions were genuine, if she interprets it as manipulative or not heartfelt, that can cause hurt. Maybe he didn't consider that keeping a written list might make her feel like he wasn't naturally remembering or caring about her. It's possible that she values spontaneity and sincerity more than planned gestures, even if those plans are well-meaning.\n\nBut then again, he did it to show his love and effort. He didn't share it with anyone, so it was private. The problem is that her feelings were hurt, and he needs to address that. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether his actions crossed into something that was a breach of trust or if it was just a misunderstanding. Since he had no malicious intent, maybe it's more about communication rather than being wrong. But she feels betrayed, so maybe he should have talked to her about it sooner instead of keeping it a secret. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's not his fault entirely. Some people might take offense to such a thing, and it's more about her perspective. But since the question is whether he's at fault, the answer hinges on if keeping the notes was an overstep. Since the answer options are A (yes) or B (no), I think it's a judgment call. But considering that his actions were heartfelt and not harmful, but her feelings are valid, maybe the answer is B. However, if keeping such a list without her knowledge is seen as a breach of trust, then maybe A. The community might lean towards B because his intent was good and it's a misunderstanding. But others might say that he should have discussed it with her to avoid this. I'm a bit torn, but I think since the intent was positive and there's no evidence of harm beyond her feelings, the answer is B.\n"
