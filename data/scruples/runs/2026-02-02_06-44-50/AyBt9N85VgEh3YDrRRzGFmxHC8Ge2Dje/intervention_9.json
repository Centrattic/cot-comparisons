She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who wrote down personal details about his wife in a notebook called \"The Almanac.\" He did this to remember important things about her, like her favorite flowers, colors, restaurants, etc. He used it to make her feel special by recalling these things. However, when his wife found the notebook, she was upset, felt betrayed, and considered it a \"playbook,\" which cheapened his gestures. Now, he's worried she might destroy it and is heartbroken.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user initially thinks he is, but wants my opinion. Let's analyze.\n\nFirst, the man's intention was good. He wanted to remember his wife's preferences to show his love and care. This is a common way some people keep track of important details about their partners. However, the key issue here is the wife's reaction. She felt betrayed and that the notebook was a list of tactics rather than genuine effort. The fact that he kept it secret might play into her feeling that he's keeping something from her or treating the relationship like a strategy game.\n\nTrust and transparency are crucial in relationships. Even though his actions were well-meaning, keeping a secret like this could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if the wife felt it wasn't a genuine expression of love. She might feel that instead of remembering things organically, he's relying on a playbook, which could make her question the authenticity of his actions. The fact that she's upset about it and considering destroying it suggests that her feelings are valid and significant.\n\nAnother angle is the husband's perspective: he's trying to be a better partner by remembering these things. He didn't share it with anyone, and it was his way of showing love. However, the wife's feelings matter just as much. If she's uncomfortable with this method, even if his intentions were pure, he might have overlooked her emotional needs. The core issue is about mutual respect and understanding each other's perspectives.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband didn't anticipate that keeping a detailed notebook might be perceived negatively. He might need to have an open conversation about why she feels that way and reassess how he can express his love in ways that make her feel valued, rather than like she's part of a strategy. So, while his actions were based on love, the way it was received was negative, which points to a possible fault in not considering her feelings or discussing it with her beforehand.\n\nIn conclusion, the husband's intentions were good, but the outcome was hurtful to his wife. The question is whether the action itself (keeping the notebook) was wrong. Since the wife's feelings are valid and he caused her distress without realizing how she would perceive it, he might be in the wrong for not considering her viewpoint. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
