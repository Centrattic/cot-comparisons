She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he created this Almanac, which is a notebook where he writes down all the little details about his wife\u2014her favorite things, stuff she mentioned, etc. He does this to remember them so he can do sweet things for her. But when she found it, she got upset, called it a \"playbook,\" felt betrayed, and now there's tension between them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to remember things to show his love and make his wife feel special. He didn't share it with anyone, kept it private. He thought it was a good way to stay connected, to remember the things she cares about. So his motivation seems genuine\u2014love and effort to maintain the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, his wife's reaction is important. She feels that having an Almanac cheapens the sweet things he does. She might see it as insincere, like he's just going through a list of things to do, rather than being genuinely present and thoughtful. Maybe she feels objectified, like he's treating her as a project to be managed with notes. The term \"playbook\" suggests she might think he's calculating, using strategies to win her over instead of being authentic. That could make her feel like her feelings aren't being met with genuine love but with a script.\n\nAnother angle is consent and communication. The author didn't discuss the Almanac with her before, so she might not have been aware of the extent of his note-taking. Even if his intentions were good, keeping it a secret might have led to misunderstanding. Perhaps she values spontaneity and natural gestures over planned-out actions, which the Almanac represents. Her reaction could also stem from a need for her husband to be present and not rely on written notes to remember such things.\n\nIt's possible that the problem isn't the Almanac itself but how each person perceives the other's actions. The husband sees it as effort to remember and care; the wife sees it as inauthentic. The key here is whether the Almanac undermines the emotional connection she wants. If she feels that the sweet acts are now just items on a list, then maybe he is crossing a line, even if unintentionally.\n\nBut then again, writing down things to remember is a common strategy for people who fear forgetting important details. The husband is trying to be a good partner, and his method backfired because of his wife's different perspective. The issue might be about differing expectations in relationships\u2014how they express and expect love.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's tricky. The author didn't have bad intentions, but the action caused hurt. The question is whether the means (keeping an Almanac) were appropriate. In terms of right or wrong, maybe the problem isn't the Almanac itself but the lack of discussion about it. The husband might need to understand his wife's perspective better and find another way to show love that doesn't make her feel like he's scripting their relationship. However, since his intentions were good, maybe he's not entirely at fault. The answer might be that he's not in the wrong because his intentions were to love and remember her, but he needs to adjust his approach. But some might argue that even with good intentions, the method was wrong because it led to her feeling betrayed. \n\nAlternatively, the wife's reaction could be overreacting if the Almanac is a genuine expression of love. But if it's causing harm, then maybe the husband should reevaluate. The key is whether the act of keeping the Almanac is inherently wrong or if it's a matter of differing relationship styles. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and considering that intentions are good, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's room for interpretation based on the emotional impact.\n"
