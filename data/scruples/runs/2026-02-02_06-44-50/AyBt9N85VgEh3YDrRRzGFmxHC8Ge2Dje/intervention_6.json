She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who keeps a notebook called \"The Almanac\" where he writes down personal details about his wife to remember them and do sweet things for her. The wife found out and is upset, feeling betrayed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The husband's intention was to remember things because he loves her and wants to be a good partner. He didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. However, the wife felt that having the notebook made his gestures feel insincere, like a playbook. She felt cheapened, which is significant.\n\nThe key points are about trust and communication. The husband didn't think the notebook was a big deal, but the wife's reaction shows that she felt her privacy was invaded. Even though he meant well, keeping a detailed record of her personal preferences and sharing them in a way that made her feel like he was using a script could undermine the authenticity she values in their relationship. It's possible that the husband didn't consider how she might perceive the notebook, assuming she would understand his intentions. However, her feelings are valid because it's about how she feels respected and sincere in the relationship.\n\nSo, while the husband's intentions were good, the action of keeping a secret notebook that led to her feeling betrayed might be seen as a mistake. He didn't communicate his reasons to her beforehand, and her reaction indicates that the method of remembering details in that way clashed with her expectations. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because the impact on her feelings matters more than the intention, even if the intention was positive.\n"
