She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the husband created this notebook called \"The Almanac\" where he wrote down all sorts of personal details about his wife\u2014her favorite things, anecdotes, etc. He did this to remember important stuff and to use it to do sweet things for her. But when she found it, she felt betrayed and called it her \"playbook,\" thinking he was using it to manipulate her or cheapen their gestures. Now she's upset, and he's wondering if he did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's intention was good; he wanted to remember things about his wife because he loves her. He didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. On the other hand, the wife felt that having a written list of her personal details made her feel like he was using a script, which made her feel used or manipulative. \n\nWhy would she feel that way? Maybe because she values spontaneity and genuine actions without any prior planning. Or perhaps she feels that her personal information shouldn't be documented, even if it's for good reasons. There's also the aspect of consent\u2014did she know he was keeping track of all these things? He mentions that he never told anyone about the Almanac until she found it, so she wasn't aware he had all that information written down. That lack of transparency might be part of the issue. \n\nBut the husband didn't have any malicious intent. He thought it was a thoughtful way to remember important things. However, the problem arises from the wife's perspective. Even if his intentions were good, if his actions caused her emotional distress, then there's a problem. The key point here is about communication. He didn't talk to her about why he created the Almanac or how he intended to use it. Instead, he kept it a secret, and when she found out, she felt hurt. \n\nSo, maybe the issue isn't the act of keeping notes itself, but the fact that he didn't communicate with her about it. The wife might have felt that her private information was being used without her knowledge, even if it was for positive reasons. Trust is important in a relationship, and secrets, even if well-intentioned, can sometimes damage that trust. \n\nAnother angle is the wife's reaction. She called it a \"playbook,\" implying that she feels he's using a strategy to get affection or approval, which might not be his intention. The husband might not have considered how having a written list could make her feel about their relationship's authenticity. \n\nIn relationships, what one person sees as a thoughtful gesture, the other might perceive as manipulative or insincere. The husband's actions were based on his understanding of what would make their relationship better, but he didn't account for his wife's feelings about the method. So even if he's not wrong in intention, the outcome shows that his approach was flawed because he didn't communicate and consider her perspective. \n\nIn conclusion, while the husband's intentions were good, the lack of communication and the wife's resulting feelings of betrayal suggest that he is in the wrong. The mistake was not discussing with her how he wanted to remember her preferences and why. The act of keeping the notes was okay, but the secrecy and lack of transparency led to hurt feelings.\n"
