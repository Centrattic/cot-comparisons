She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for keeping an almanac with personal notes about his wife. The situation is that the wife found out about the notebook and felt betrayed, calling it a \"playbook\" and thinking the sweet things he did were cheapened by him having written them down. The author didn't show it to anyone, just kept it for himself to remember things.\n\nHmm, so the main issue is about trust and the wife's feelings. The author didn't have bad intentions; he wanted to remember important things about his wife because he loves her. But the wife perceives it as insincere or manipulative. Now, does that make him wrong?\n\nWell, intent vs. impact. The author's intent was genuine, to remember things out of love. But the impact on his wife was negative. Even if the intention was good, if it hurt her feelings and caused betrayal, then maybe there's a problem. But is the author in the wrong? Or is it about communication?\n\nHe kept it a secret because he didn't want anyone else to know. Maybe he should have discussed with her why he was keeping the notes. Maybe she felt like her personal details were being stored without her consent. Privacy issues? But he's the one who knows her best, so it's a bit of a gray area.\n\nIn relationships, transparency is important. If the wife found out in an unexpected way and it made her feel used, even if the intent wasn't to use it that way, maybe the author should have been more open. However, the act of writing down things to remember is a kind gesture. The problem is how the wife interpreted it. So, is the author wrong for keeping the notes, or is the wife overreacting?\n\nI think it's a matter of perspective. The author's actions weren't malicious, but the wife's feelings are valid. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but he needs to address her feelings. However, some might argue that keeping such a personal list without discussing it could be seen as manipulative, even if unintended. So maybe he's in the wrong for not being transparent. But others might say it's his way of showing love and not his fault how she took it. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because his intentions were good and he didn't share it with others. But it's a tough call.\n"
