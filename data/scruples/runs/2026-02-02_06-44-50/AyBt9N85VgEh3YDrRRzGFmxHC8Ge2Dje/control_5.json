She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an \"Almanac\" of notes about his wife's preferences. The key points here are about intent and perception. \n\nThe author created the Almanac to remember important details about his wife because he wanted to show his love and avoid being the kind of husband who forgets things. He never intended to use it in a manipulative way, just to recall personal info to make her feel loved. However, his wife found out and felt that it cheapened the sweet gestures he made, calling it a \"playbook\" and feeling betrayed. \n\nSo, is he wrong? The intention was good\u2014he wanted to be a thoughtful partner. But maybe the wife felt it was insincere because she values spontaneity or genuine memory over written notes. She might feel that the love should come from the heart, not from a list. The problem here is that his action, though well-meaning, didn't align with her expectations. \n\nIn relationships, it's about communication and mutual understanding. If he didn't explain the purpose of the Almanac and she felt it was a tool for manipulation, then there's a misunderstanding. However, he did mention he had no bad intentions. The issue is that she felt betrayed, which is a strong emotional reaction. \n\nBut is he wrong? Maybe not in terms of intent, but the action led to hurt feelings. The line between being thoughtful and being manipulative can be thin. If the wife perceives it as a playbook, then from her perspective, he's in the wrong. However, if the author's intention was pure, maybe not. The answer depends on whose perspective you take. \n\nSince the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the wife is upset, but the author's intentions were good, it's a nuanced situation. The answer might be that he's not in the wrong (B), but he needs to address her feelings. However, since she feels betrayed, maybe he is (A). But I think the key is that he didn't mean to do anything bad, so he's not at fault. The answer is B.\n"
