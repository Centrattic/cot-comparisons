She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he created this \"Almanac\" with all sorts of notes about his wife's preferences and things he wants to remember for her. He never told her about it, kept it a secret, and when she found out, she felt betrayed and thought he was using it as a \"playbook\" for sweet gestures, which made her feel like his actions weren't genuine. Now, he's asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author's intention was to remember things he might forget because he loves his wife. He wanted to do sweet things for her, which is a good and thoughtful gesture. Keeping a notebook to help with that seems like a practical way to ensure he doesn't forget important personal details. He didn't share it with anyone, which could be seen as keeping it private, maybe even as a personal tool for their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction is strong. She felt that the Almanac cheapened every sweet thing he did for her. She interpreted it as a \"playbook,\" which implies she thought he was strategizing his gestures rather than doing them from the heart. This could lead her to feel that his actions weren't sincere anymore. The fact that he didn't tell her about it might contribute to her feeling that he's keeping secrets or not being open about his intentions. The betrayal and feeling of being used are significant emotional responses here.\n\nNow, the key points are: intention vs. perception. The author's intention was good, but the effect on his wife was negative. The question is whether keeping such a private record without her knowledge was wrong. Some people might argue that keeping secrets in a relationship, even if well-intentioned, can cause mistrust. Others might say that it's a personal way to manage his memory and that the wife's reaction is overblown.\n\nAlso, the term \"playbook\" is interesting. A playbook is usually a set of planned strategies, which could make his gestures seem rehearsed rather than spontaneous. If she feels that every nice thing he does is part of a script, that could undermine her trust in his genuine feelings.\n\nAnother angle is communication. If he had shared the Almanac with her earlier, they might have discussed it and found common ground. His decision to keep it a secret might have led to misunderstandings. In relationships, transparency is important. Secrets, no matter how small, can sometimes lead to bigger issues if not addressed.\n\nBut then again, is keeping a personal journal a form of secrecy? Maybe not inherently. People often keep personal notes for themselves. However, in a relationship, certain things might be expected to be shared. The line is blurry here. The author didn't hide it intentionally; he just didn't think about the possibility that she would find it problematic. But once found out, his reaction is to be defensive, which might not be helpful.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he had no malicious intent and the action wasn't intended to deceive, maybe not at fault. However, the impact on his wife is significant. In relationships, how actions make the other person feel is crucial. If the wife feels betrayed and her trust is broken, then the author's action, though well-meaning, caused harm. Therefore, he might be at fault for not considering her perspective and not communicating his intentions.\n\nBut then again, maybe the wife's reaction is a bit harsh. Not everyone would have the same response. It depends on the dynamics of their relationship. If the author was trying to be thoughtful, but the wife sees it as manipulative, then the author might need to explain his intentions to reconcile the misunderstanding. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions were good, the lack of communication and the resulting emotional harm to his wife might place some responsibility on him. However, whether he's \"in the wrong\" depends on cultural or personal relationship norms. In many cases, transparency is key, so not discussing such a personal item might be seen as a failure to communicate, making him at least partially at fault. But others might argue that it's a personal tool and not inherently wrong. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards him being in the wrong because of the impact on his wife.\n"
