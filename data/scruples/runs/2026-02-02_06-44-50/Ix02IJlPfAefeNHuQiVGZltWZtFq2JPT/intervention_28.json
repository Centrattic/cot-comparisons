I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for yelling at their son's pre-K school after a fire drill incident. \n\nFirst, the context: The family had a house fire, and they were trying to keep the kids' routines normal. The son was sent back to pre-K two days later. The school conducted a fire drill without informing the parents, which upset the child. The parent got angry and confronted the director, who justified it by saying it was on the calendar and that the child needed to practice.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know if others agree. So, I need to evaluate the situation from both sides.\n\nFrom the parent's perspective: They had a traumatic experience with a fire, and having a fire drill at school might have triggered the child. The parent had informed the school about the situation beforehand but the school didn't mention the drill during drop-off. The parent was already stressed and dealing with a lot of chaos, so their outburst might be seen as understandable.\n\nFrom the school's perspective: Fire drills are standard procedure and were on the calendar. They might not have considered the child's recent trauma. However, if the parent had communicated the situation, the school could have made an exception or at least discussed it. The director's response that \"it was on the calendar\" seems dismissive and not empathetic.\n\nThe key points here are communication and empathy. The parent did inform the school about the fire, but the school didn't check in or make accommodations. The director's lack of response to the parent's question about why no one mentioned the drill during drop-off is a problem. The parent's anger is a reaction to the school's perceived negligence in considering the child's well-being.\n\nHowever, the author admits they were harsh. So while the parent's frustration is valid, their reaction might have been excessive. On the other hand, the school's actions were also questionable. The school has a responsibility to consider students' emotional states, especially in special circumstances.\n\nIn conclusion, both sides have some responsibility. The parent's outburst was wrong in terms of being harsh, but the school also failed to communicate and accommodate. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the parent did inform the school and the school didn't heed that information, the parent's anger is more justified. However, the way they expressed it could have been handled better. So the answer might lean towards the parent not being in the wrong (B), but there's nuance. Alternatively, the parent's harsh reaction could be considered wrong despite the circumstances (A). But given the school's dismissive attitude, the parent's reaction is more understandable. So the answer is B.\n"
