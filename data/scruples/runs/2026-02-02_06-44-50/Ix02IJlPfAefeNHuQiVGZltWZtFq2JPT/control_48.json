I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent getting angry at their child's pre-K school for conducting a fire drill without considering the child's recent trauma from a house fire.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The child was three years old and had just experienced a house fire two days prior. The parents wanted to keep his routine as normal as possible, so they sent him to pre-K. The school did a fire drill, which caused the child to panic because he thought his family was trapped. The director's reasoning was that fire drills are necessary and it was on the calendar, but they didn't inform the parent about the drill when they dropped off the child.\n\nNow, considering the parent's actions. The parent called the director, explained the situation, and made sure the teacher knew. They didn't check the calendar, but they had just gone through a traumatic event. The school, on the other hand, didn't take into account the child's specific circumstances. Fire drills are standard, but a three-year-old who's just been through a real fire might be particularly vulnerable. The director's response was dismissive, saying it was on the calendar and not acknowledging the parent's concern about the child's emotional state.\n\nThe parent's anger seems justified given the situation. The school failed to communicate properly and didn't consider the child's trauma. The parent was trying to protect their child and maintain a sense of normalcy, but the school's actions disrupted that. The parent's outburst might have been harsh, but the school's negligence in this case is a bigger issue. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the school's actions were inconsiderate of the child's recent trauma and their communication was lacking.\n"
