I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for losing their temper with the pre-K school after their son had a bad experience during a fire drill.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The parent's 3-year-old son had just been through a house fire, and two days later, the school did a fire drill without warning him. The child got upset because he thought his family didn't come back, which is a common fear for a child. The parent got angry and confronted the director, who justified it by saying it was on the calendar. The parent is now wondering if they were wrong for reacting that way.\n\nHmm. The parent's perspective is that the school didn't consider the child's trauma and didn't communicate the fire drill when the parent dropped off the kid. The parent was already stressed from the fire and had to take their child out of school that day. The school, on the other hand, might argue that fire drills are standard and they followed the calendar, so they didn't see a need to adjust.\n\nNow, is the parent in the wrong? Well, the parent was in a high-stress situation. Their child had just been through a traumatic event, and the school's action could have exacerbated that trauma. The school should have been aware of the situation when the parent dropped off the child and adjusted the fire drill, especially considering the child's age and recent trauma. The director's response of \"it was on the calendar\" seems dismissive and not considering the individual circumstances. \n\nThe parent's reaction, while possibly harsh, was in response to the school's failure to accommodate their child's needs. The parent had communicated the situation to the director the night before, so the school was aware. Not informing the parent at drop-off and proceeding with the drill without considering the child's emotional state is a significant oversight. \n\nSo, I think the parent is not in the wrong. The school's actions were negligent, and the parent had a right to be upset. The answer should be B for No.\n"
