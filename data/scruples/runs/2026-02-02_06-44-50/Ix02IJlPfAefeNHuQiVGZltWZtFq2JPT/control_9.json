I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent who got really upset with their child's pre-K school after the school conducted a fire drill that upset their 3-year-old. The parent had just gone through a house fire, and the school's action during the drill triggered the child's trauma.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the school's responsibility. The school had a monthly calendar that listed the fire drill. The parent mentioned they didn't check the calendar because they were in a hurry to buy clothes. The school director said the drill was on the calendar, so maybe they thought it was communicated. But the parent didn't see it, and the teacher didn't inform them when dropping off the kid. The school might have a policy of announcing drills in advance, but if they didn't make sure that parents of younger children, especially those with recent trauma, were aware, that could be a problem.\n\nThe child was three years old and had just experienced a fire. The school decided to do a drill without warning, and the child panicked because he thought his family was in danger. The parent argues that a 3-year-old doesn't understand fire drills and that the school should have been more sensitive to his recent trauma. The director's response was dismissive, just saying it was on the calendar. That seems like a failure to consider the child's well-being in this specific context.\n\nThe parent's anger is understandable. They were already under a lot of stress from the fire and wanted to keep their child's routine as normal as possible. The school's action could have retraumatized the child. The parent did inform the school about the fire, so the school should have taken that into account when planning drills. Not communicating with the parent despite knowing the situation might be the school's fault.\n\nOn the other hand, the school might have standard procedures for drills and expected parents to check the calendar. But the parent didn't check it, and the staff didn't proactively inform them. Also, the child's well-being should be a priority. Even if drills are part of the routine, the school should have made exceptions for a child with recent trauma. The parent's outburst was harsh, but the situation was a result of the school's negligence in communication and sensitivity.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The school's actions were at fault here. The parent was reacting to a situation where the school didn't take necessary precautions. The answer should be B (No)."
