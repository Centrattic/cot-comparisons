I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their son's pre-K school after a fire drill. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the family had a house fire recently. They were displaced for six months. They wanted to keep things as normal as possible for their kids, so they continued sending the 3-year-old to pre-K. The mother called the school to inform them about the fire, and the teacher was made aware. However, the school decided to do a fire drill without informing the mother again when she dropped the kid off. The child got scared during the drill because his family didn't come out, leading to a meltdown. The mother was upset and confronted the director, who said it was on the calendar, and no one addressed her when she dropped the kid off.\n\nNow, the key points here. The school had been informed about the recent trauma. The mother specifically mentioned the situation to the teacher. The school's response was to proceed with a fire drill, which is standard practice but in this context, might not be sensitive. The mother was in a stressful time, dealing with a fire's aftermath, trying to maintain normalcy. The school's failure to consider the child's trauma and to communicate with the parents is a problem. The director's justification of \"it was on the calendar\" seems dismissive. \n\nThe mother's reaction was harsh, but given the context\u2014her child just went through a traumatic event, the school didn't take precautions\u2014it's understandable. The school has a responsibility to be considerate of a child's well-being, especially when they know about a recent traumatic experience. The author's anger is directed at the school's negligence in this case. \n\nIs the mother in the wrong? She was upset and yelled, which might not have been the best approach, but the core issue is the school's failure to accommodate the child's needs. The mother informed them, so the school should have adjusted the drill. Therefore, the mother isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
