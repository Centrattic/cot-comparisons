I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent who gets angry at their child's pre-K school for conducting a fire drill without considering the recent traumatic experience of a house fire.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The parent's son had just turned 3 and was attending pre-K. Right after their house caught fire, the family was displaced for six months. They wanted to maintain normalcy for the kids, so they sent the son to school two days after the fire. The parent informed the school director about the incident and left, not checking the calendar. The next day, the school did a fire drill, which upset the child because he didn't understand and thought his family didn't come out. The director defended it by saying it was on the calendar, but didn't communicate with the parent when dropping off the child.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: Did the school handle the fire drill appropriately given the child's recent trauma? And was the parent justified in their anger and reaction?\n\nFrom the school's perspective, they might argue that fire drills are standard procedures to prepare children. However, the parent had informed them about the fire, which is a significant event for a 3-year-old. The school should have made accommodations or at least communicated with the parent about the drill, especially after being made aware of the situation. The fact that the parent was present when dropping off the child and the director didn't mention the drill suggests a failure in communication. The school's reliance on the calendar without personal communication seems insufficient. \n\nThe parent's reaction is understandable given the circumstances. The child was recently traumatized by a fire, and conducting a drill without any warning could have re-traumatized him. The parent's anger stems from the school's lack of consideration and communication. While the parent might have been harsh in their response, the school's actions were negligent. \n\nTherefore, the parent is not in the wrong because the school failed to take the child's situation into account and didn't communicate properly. The answer should be B (No).\n"
