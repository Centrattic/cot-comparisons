I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent who was upset with their child's pre-K school for conducting a fire drill right after their house fire. The parent felt the school was insensitive, especially since they had just informed the school about the incident.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The child was three years old, and the school decided to do a fire drill without warning. The parent had informed the school about the fire and their intention to keep the child's routine normal. However, the school didn't adjust the fire drill, leading to the child's distress. The parent confronted the director, who justified it by saying it was on the calendar.\n\nNow, considering the parent's reaction. They were upset because the child was still dealing with trauma from the fire. The school's decision to do the drill without considering the recent trauma could be seen as neglectful. The parent's anger stems from the school's lack of sensitivity and failure to communicate. The director's response about the calendar being there for everyone doesn't address the specific circumstances of the child. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the school has a duty to be aware of students' situations and adjust activities when necessary. Especially for a three-year-old, a fire drill might be traumatic. The school didn't warn the parent or the child, which shows a lack of consideration. The parent's outburst was a reaction to the school's oversight, which might not be entirely justified, but the school's actions were questionable. \n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? The parent did inform the school, but maybe they should have insisted on exceptions. However, the school's failure to accommodate a three-year-old's trauma seems like a bigger issue. The parent's harsh reaction is understandable given the circumstances. Therefore, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
