I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their child's pre-K school after a fire drill incident. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the background: The parent's son was in a pre-K program. They had a house fire when the kid was 3, and they wanted to keep things normal, so they kept him in the program. The school did a fire drill without warning, and the kid was upset because his family didn't come out. The parent got angry and confronted the director, who justified it by saying it was on the calendar. The parent is now asking if they're at fault.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the school's responsibility to accommodate the child's situation and the parent's reaction. The school had prior knowledge of the fire because the parent informed them. The teacher was aware, but the director didn't mention the fire drill during drop-off. The calendar was there, but the parent didn't check it because they were running errands. \n\nThe school's defense is that the fire drill was on the calendar, implying it's routine. But the child had a recent traumatic experience. The school's job is to be sensitive to the child's emotional state. Even if fire drills are standard, the staff should have considered the child's background. Not mentioning the drill to the parent after they had just gone through a fire seems inconsiderate. The director's response was dismissive, which probably escalated the parent's anger.\n\nThe parent's reaction was harsh, but given the circumstances, can you blame them? The school failed to communicate properly and was insensitive to the child's trauma. The parent's main issue was that the school didn't take the situation into account. The director's justification of the calendar is weak because the parent was in a situation where they couldn't check the calendar (they had to buy clothes for the family). The school should have taken the initiative to inform the parent, especially since they knew about the fire.\n\nSo, in terms of fault, the school made a mistake. The parent's anger is understandable. They weren't in the wrong for being upset. The director's handling was poor. The parent's outburst might have been harsh, but the school shares responsibility. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
