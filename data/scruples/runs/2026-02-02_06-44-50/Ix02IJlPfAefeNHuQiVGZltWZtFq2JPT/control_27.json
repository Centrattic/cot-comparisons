I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The story is about a parent whose child was enrolled in a PreK program. After a house fire, they sent the child back to school two days later. The school conducted a fire drill without prior notice or explanation, which upset the child because he didn't understand why it happened and thought his family wasn't coming back. The parent was angry and confronted the director, who justified it by saying it was on the calendar.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The child is three years old, which is a very young age. The parent just experienced a traumatic event and wanted to maintain normalcy for the child. The school had a calendar that was visible to parents, which included the fire drill. The parent didn't check the calendar when dropping off the child, and the school didn't mention it during drop-off. The director's reasoning was that the child needs to get used to fire drills, but the parent argues that a three-year-old can't process that.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the school's actions were appropriate and if the parent overreacted. The school's responsibility is to ensure the safety of the children, including conducting fire drills. However, they also have a duty to be sensitive to any specific circumstances, especially when a child has recently experienced a traumatic event. \n\nIf the fire drill was scheduled and on the calendar, the parent's failure to check it might be a point of consideration. But the school's approach here is questionable. Even if it's on the calendar, they should have proactively informed the parent during drop-off about the upcoming drill, given the recent fire. At three years old, the child's emotional state is fragile, and a fire drill could trigger anxiety or fear. \n\nThe director's statement that \"it was on the calendar\" suggests a lack of empathy and consideration for the child's situation. The school's policy might be to do drills without prior notice to parents, but in this case, the child's traumatic experience should have warranted an exception. The parent's reaction, while perhaps intense, is understandable given the context. They were trying to protect their child from another traumatic experience during a vulnerable time.\n\nThe parent might not be in the wrong because the school didn't accommodate the child's needs. The school's failure to communicate the drill despite the parent's known situation is the main issue. However, the parent didn't check the calendar, which could be seen as their oversight. But considering the child's age and the recent trauma, the school's responsibility to adjust their procedures is more critical here. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B, meaning the author is not in the wrong. The school should have been more considerate and provided the necessary context to prevent distressing the child. The parent's anger is a reaction to the school's lack of sensitivity, not inappropriate behavior on their part.\n"
