I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for yelling at their child's pre-K school after a fire drill. \n\nFirst, the situation: The parent's son had a house fire, and they wanted to keep his routine normal by sending him to school. The pre-K did a fire drill without informing the parent, who had just gone through a traumatic event. The parent got angry when their child was upset during the drill and confronted the director.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The parent's perspective: their child was recently traumatized by a fire, and the school did a drill without knowing the situation. The parent informed the school the night before, but the director didn't check in when dropping off. The drill could have been especially scary for the child, who was only 3. The parent's reaction was justified because the school didn't take precautions.\n\nOn the school's side, they might have a policy to do fire drills regularly, and the calendar was public. However, the director didn't confirm with the parent upon drop-off, despite being aware of the situation. They should have been more sensitive to the child's trauma and adjusted the drill accordingly.\n\nThe parent was harsh, but the school's failure to communicate and accommodate the child's needs is a big issue. The parent's anger stems from their child's distress and the school's lack of empathy. While the parent's approach might have been confrontational, the school's actions were negligent in this specific case. \n\nSo, the parent isn't in the wrong because the school didn't handle the situation appropriately. The answer should be B.\n"
