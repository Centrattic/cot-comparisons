I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The story is about a parent who got angry at their child's pre-K school for doing a fire drill without warning the child, especially after the family had a house fire. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The child just turned 3 and had a traumatic experience in a house fire. The parent sent the child to school two days later to maintain normalcy. The school decided to do a fire drill, which upset the child because he didn't understand why his family didn't come out during the drill. The teacher said it was on the calendar, but the parent wasn't informed when dropping off the child.\n\nNow, considering the parent's reaction. The parent was clearly upset and angry, which is understandable given the recent trauma. The school's decision to do a fire drill without considering the child's specific circumstances might be questionable. The director's response about the calendar not addressing the situation shows a lack of communication and empathy. \n\nThe parent did call the director beforehand to inform them about the fire, so the school should have been aware of the child's trauma. The fact that the school didn't check in with the parent at drop-off, even after being informed of the situation, is a problem. The parent's anger stems from the school's negligence in handling the child's emotional needs. \n\nEven though the parent's reaction was harsh, the school's actions contributed to the child's distress. The parent wasn't in the wrong for standing up for their child's well-being. The school's failure to accommodate the child's trauma and lack of communication likely justified the parent's anger, even if their approach was extreme.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the school's actions were negligent, and the parent had a valid reason to be upset.\n"
