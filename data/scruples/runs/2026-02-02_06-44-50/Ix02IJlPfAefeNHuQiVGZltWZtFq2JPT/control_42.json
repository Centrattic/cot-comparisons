I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a parent sending their 3-year-old to pre-K after a house fire, and the school did a fire drill without warning the kid, leading to a meltdown. The parent got angry at the director and is now asking if they were wrong to do so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The parent's perspective: they just went through a traumatic house fire, wanted to keep their child's routine as normal as possible. They communicated the situation to the school, dropped off the child, and then the school decided to do a fire drill. The child was scared because he didn't understand why his family didn't come out like in the drill, which is understandable for a 3-year-old. The parent was upset and confronted the director, who justified it by saying it was on the calendar and didn't mention the situation. The parent feels wronged because the school didn't make an exception given the recent trauma.\n\nOn the school's side, they might have a policy to conduct fire drills regularly for safety. The director might not have considered the child's specific circumstances, especially since the parent didn't bring it up during drop-off. The calendar being public might be a way for parents to stay informed, but maybe the school didn't check if the parents were aware or if they needed adjustments.\n\nNow, was the parent wrong? Well, they did inform the school about the situation. The school didn't ask if they should modify the drill for this child. The parent's anger seems justified because the child was traumatized by the fire, and the drill could have reminded him of the trauma. The school should have made accommodations. The parent's reaction might have been harsh, but their frustration is understandable given the circumstances. The director didn't address the parent's concerns properly. So the parent isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
