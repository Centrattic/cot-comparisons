I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their son's pre-K after a fire drill. The situation is that the family had a house fire, and they wanted to keep their son's routine as normal as possible. The pre-K had a fire drill, and the director didn't warn the parents even though it was on the calendar. The author got angry and yelled at the director.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The parents are dealing with a traumatic house fire, which is a serious event. They wanted to maintain their son's routine, which is a common reaction to help children feel secure. The pre-K program had a scheduled fire drill, which is a standard practice in schools for safety. However, the director didn't inform the parents when they dropped the child off, even though the author had mentioned the recent fire. The director's justification was that the child needs to be prepared for such scenarios, which is a bit cold.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the school have an obligation to inform the parents about the fire drill, especially after a traumatic event at home? Fire drills are part of school safety, but the child was only 3 and had just experienced a real fire. The parents had communicated the situation the night before, so the school should have been aware. The director's response about the calendar being the notice might not be sufficient because the parents were already in a stressful situation and might not have had time to read the calendar. The school's failure to make an exception or provide a heads-up could be seen as insensitive. \n\nThe author's reaction was strong, but considering the stress they were under and the child's age, maybe it's understandable. They had to deal with a lot post-fire, and the school's decision to do a drill without considering the child's trauma might be a mistake. The director's lack of empathy in not acknowledging the family's situation could be a contributing factor. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The school's actions were not ideal, especially not informing the parents despite being aware of the recent fire. The parents had a valid reason to be upset because the drill could exacerbate the child's trauma. The author's outburst might be seen as a reaction to negligence. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), as the school should have been more considerate in this situation.\n"
