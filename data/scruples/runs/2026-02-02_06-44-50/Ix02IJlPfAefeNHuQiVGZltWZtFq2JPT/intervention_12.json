I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The story is about a parent who got angry at their pre-K school for conducting a fire drill on a 3-year-old who had recently experienced a house fire. The parent is questioning if their reaction was justified.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The child's family had a house fire, which is a traumatic event. The parents wanted to maintain normalcy by continuing the pre-K schedule. The school, however, decided to do a fire drill without informing the parents, even though they had been told about the situation. The parent was upset when the teacher didn't adjust the drill to accommodate the child's trauma and lost their temper.\n\nNow, considering the parent's perspective: They were under a lot of stress from the fire and moving, trying to keep things normal. The school didn't communicate properly, didn't check if the teacher was aware of the situation, and proceeded with a drill that could be traumatic for a 3-year-old. The parent felt it was inconsiderate and reacted strongly.\n\nOn the school's side: They might have followed standard procedures, thinking the fire drill is necessary for safety. The director mentioned it was on the calendar, implying it's part of the regular schedule. However, they didn't check in with the parents or make an exception given the child's recent trauma. That's a key point. Schools are supposed to be flexible, especially in such situations.\n\nThe parent's anger is understandable. The school's failure to accommodate a known traumatic situation shows a lack of empathy and communication. The parent was within their rights to be upset, especially since they had already informed the school about the fire. The school's response of just saying it was on the calendar seems dismissive and thoughtless.\n\nSo, in terms of blame: The parent's reaction was a response to the school's negligence in not considering the child's welfare. The parent wasn't in the wrong for being upset, but maybe they could have handled it differently, like discussing it calmly first. However, the core issue is the school's failure to act with care and consideration. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong here. The answer would be B.\n"
