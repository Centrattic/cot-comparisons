I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the story is about a parent who sends their 3-year-old to pre-K after a house fire. The school did a fire drill without warning the kid, which caused him to freak out because his family didn't come out. The parent gets angry at the school director and yells at her. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's side. Their home had a fire, they were displaced for months, and they wanted to keep their child's routine as normal as possible. They informed the school about the situation the night before sending the kid. The parent even met with the teacher to make sure they were aware. However, when dropping off, they didn't check the calendar, which had the fire drill scheduled. The school decided to do the drill without considering the child's trauma, leading to a meltdown.\n\nThe parent's reaction is understandable. Their child was already experiencing a traumatic event, and the school's decision to do a fire drill without any warning or accommodation could have been detrimental. The director's reasoning that it was on the calendar and that the child needs to get used to it seems dismissive of the child's emotional state. The parent was probably stressed and dealing with a lot, so their outburst might be seen as a reaction to the school's negligence.\n\nOn the other hand, the school has a responsibility to prepare children for emergencies, including fire drills. However, they should also be aware of each child's individual circumstances. Since the parent had informed the school about the fire, it's reasonable to expect that the school would make accommodations for the child. The fact that they didn't communicate the fire drill during drop-off, even though the parent was present, suggests a failure to consider the child's situation.\n\nSo, the parent might not be in the wrong because the school didn't take into account the child's recent trauma when planning the drill. The parent's anger stems from the school's lack of consideration. The director's response about the calendar being public doesn't address the specific needs of a child who just experienced a fire. The parent might have overreacted emotionally, but the root cause is the school's oversight.\n"
