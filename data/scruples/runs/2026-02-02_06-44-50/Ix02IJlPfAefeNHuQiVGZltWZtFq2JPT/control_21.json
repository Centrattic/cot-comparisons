I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is whether the parent is in the wrong for yelling at the preschool director. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the kid was in a pre-K program, and they had a fire drill. The parent had just gone through a house fire, and the kid was traumatized. The school did the fire drill without informing the parent, even though the parent had told the director about the fire and the kid's situation. The director said it was on the calendar, but didn't mention it when the parent dropped off the child. The parent got upset and confronted the director.\n\nSo the parent's main issue is that the school didn't communicate properly. They had been informed about the recent trauma and the child's age, and yet they proceeded with the fire drill without letting the parent know in advance. The parent's reaction was anger, but was their action (yelling at the director) justified?\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the school should have considered the child's well-being. A 3-year-old who just experienced a fire might be more sensitive to fire drills. The school's protocol might be to do regular drills, but when a child has a specific trauma, they should make exceptions. The director's response was to say it was on the calendar, which is a general notice, not a specific communication to parents with relevant children. The parent had already contacted the school about the situation, so the school should have been aware to adjust their approach.\n\nThe parent's anger is understandable given the circumstances. The school's lack of communication and failure to consider the child's needs could be seen as negligence. Therefore, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset. However, the question is about whether the parent is \"in the wrong.\" The parent might have been harsh in their reaction, but the school's actions were probably the main issue. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
