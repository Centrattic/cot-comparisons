I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user's son was in a pre-K program. They had a house fire, and after two days, they decided to send him to school to keep things normal. The mom called the director to inform them about the fire and that they were sending the kid, but when she dropped him off, she didn't look at the calendar. The school had a fire drill that day, which wasn't communicated to the parents. The son was upset because he thought his family was in a fire again, and the director's response was that it was on the calendar and the kid needed to get used to it. The mom was angry and confronted the director, and now she's asking if she's at fault.\n\nHmm. The main points here are about the school's responsibility to communicate the fire drill, especially considering the child's recent traumatic experience. The director's justification was the calendar being on display, but the mom didn't check it. However, the director didn't proactively inform the mom when she came in to drop off the child, which seems like a key issue. The school was aware of the fire via the phone call the night before, so they should have known to be cautious with activities like a fire drill. Even though the calendar was there, the school didn't make sure the parent was aware when the child was dropped off. That's a communication failure on the school's part. The kid was three years old, so the expectation that he could handle a fire drill without any warning or support from the teachers might be unreasonable. The mom's reaction, while harsh, stems from her child being traumatized. The school's lack of empathy and failure to accommodate a child in distress makes them partly at fault. The mom did call ahead, but maybe she should have emphasized the child's recent trauma more. However, the school's main responsibility is to ensure the child's safety and emotional well-being, so not warning them about the drill despite knowing the situation was a mistake. So the author isn't in the wrong; the school is. Answer B.\n"
