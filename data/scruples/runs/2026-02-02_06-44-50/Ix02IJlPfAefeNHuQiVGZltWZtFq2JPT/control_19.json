I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for yelling at their child's pre-K school after a fire drill incident. The situation involves a lot of factors, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the background: The parent's house caught fire when their son was three. They sent him to pre-K two days later to maintain a sense of normalcy. The parent informed the school director about the fire but didn't check the calendar. The school conducted a fire drill without warning the child, leading to him being upset. The parent was angry and confronted the director, who said it was on the calendar and didn't mention the situation when the parent dropped the kid off.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the school was negligent in not considering the child's recent trauma. Fire drills are standard, but the child had a real fire experience recently. The school's failure to adjust the drill or inform the parent despite being aware of the situation seems like a problem. The director's response about the calendar being a reason is weak because the parent didn't check it, and the school should have ensured the parent was informed. Also, the child was three, so expecting him to understand a fire drill without context is unreasonable.\n\nThe parent's reaction was harsh, but their anger stems from the school's negligence. The school didn't accommodate the child's needs after being informed about the fire. The parent had a right to be upset because the school didn't take the necessary precautions. The director's justification is flawed because the parent was unaware of the drill's timing, and the school didn't communicate properly. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the school is at fault for not handling the situation sensitively. The parent's outburst was extreme, but the root cause was the school's misstep. So, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). The parent is justified in their anger given the school's failure to act appropriately after being informed of the child's traumatic experience. The key points are the school's lack of communication and failure to adjust the drill, which led to the child's distress.\n"
