I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the parent sent their 3-year-old to pre-K two days after a house fire. The fire happened on the kid's birthday, and they were displaced for six months. The parents wanted to keep the child's routine as normal as possible, which seems like a valid approach. Kids can get comfort from routine during stressful times, so that makes sense. The parent called the director the night before the fire drill to inform them about the fire. Then, when dropping off the kid, they checked in with the teacher but didn't look at the calendar. \n\nThe school did a fire drill without warning the kid, which caused him to freak out because he thought his family was still in the building. The director's reasoning was that the kid needed to get used to fire drills, and it was on the calendar. The parent got angry because the school didn't inform them about the drill despite knowing the situation. \n\nSo, the parent's main argument is that the school didn't take into account the recent traumatic event and didn't make an adjustment. The director's side is that fire drills are part of the curriculum and it's on the calendar. But the parent was waiting nearby and could have picked up the kid if needed. However, the school didn't even mention the drill when the parent was there, which is a problem. \n\nAs for the parent's reaction, they lost their mind and were harsh. Losing one's temper can be understandable in a stressful situation, but being harsh might have been an overreaction. The school might have had a standard procedure, and the parent didn't check the calendar. Maybe the director was just following protocol, but that doesn't mean it was the right thing to do in this specific case. The key points are whether the school was negligent in not informing the parent about the drill after being told about the fire, and if the parent's reaction was justified. \n\nThe school should have been more considerate given the recent trauma. Even if fire drills are on the calendar, the parent was in a unique situation and the school didn't make any special accommodations. The parent might not be in the wrong for reacting strongly when their child was distressed, especially if the school failed to communicate properly. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent didn't check the calendar themselves, which could have informed them about the drill. But the director had already been alerted the night before, so the expectation might be that the school would handle it without the parent needing to check every detail. \n\nI think the school made a mistake by not considering the child's recent trauma and not informing the parent about the planned drill. The parent's anger is justified because the school didn't make an exception, and their kid was upset. The director's response about the calendar being up is weak since they were already aware of the situation. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong for their reaction. \n\nBut wait, the director said it was on the calendar. Maybe the parent missed that because they didn't check, but the director had been informed. In that case, maybe the school was at fault for not preparing the teacher to handle the situation sensitively. The parent's responsibility is to check the calendar? Or is it the school's responsibility to adjust when they know a child has a trauma? \n\nGiven that the school was already informed the night before, they should have made sure the teacher would handle the drill without causing distress. The parent's reaction is understandable if the school didn't adjust their approach. So the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
