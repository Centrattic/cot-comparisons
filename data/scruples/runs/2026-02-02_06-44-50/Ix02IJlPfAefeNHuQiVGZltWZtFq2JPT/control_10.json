I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the parent's son was in a pre-K program. They went through a house fire, and the parent wanted to keep things normal for the kids by sending the son to school. But during a fire drill at school, the kid got upset because his family didn't come out, which made the parent really angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the school's responsibility. The school had a fire drill on their calendar, which is normal for schools to do. But the parent had just informed the school about the fire incident. The school should have been aware that the child might be particularly sensitive to such a drill. Even though the fire drill was scheduled, the school didn't communicate with the parent about it when dropping off the kid. That seems like a big oversight. The director's excuse was that it was on the calendar, but the parent might not have checked the calendar because they were in a rush to get the kids more clothes. The school should have made sure to inform the parent about the drill, especially given the recent trauma.\n\nNow, the parent got angry and confronted the director. The parent admits they were harsh, but the reason was because the school didn't consider the child's emotional state. A 3-year-old who just experienced a fire would likely be very scared during a fire drill. The school's approach was not empathetic. They should have either postponed the drill for that day or prepared the child in a way that wouldn't traumatize him. \n\nThe parent's reaction, while maybe harsh, was a result of the school's failure to communicate and consider the child's well-being. So, the parent isn't in the wrong. The school is at fault here. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
