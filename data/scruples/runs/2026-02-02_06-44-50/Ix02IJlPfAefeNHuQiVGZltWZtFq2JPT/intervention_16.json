I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is at fault (AITA) for yelling at their child's preschool after a fire drill incident. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The family had a house fire two years ago. They wanted to keep their child's routine as normal as possible, so they continued sending him to preschool. The mother informed the director and teacher about the fire, so they knew the context. The preschool decided to do a fire drill, which the child was not prepared for, leading to a meltdown. The mother was upset and confronted the director, who justified it by saying it was on the calendar and that the child needed to get used to it.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the school had a policy of fire drills, which are standard safety procedures. They might have followed their usual routine without considering the child's recent trauma. However, they were aware of the situation because the mother informed them. If the school knew about the recent fire, they should have made accommodations. Fire drills might be traumatic for a child who just experienced a real fire, so the school's failure to adjust their approach could be a problem.\n\nThe mother's reaction was intense, but given the circumstances\u2014her child just went through a traumatic event, and the school didn't account for that\u2014it's understandable why she was upset. The director's response that it was on the calendar seems dismissive and doesn't take into account the child's specific needs. The school's duty of care should include being sensitive to individual circumstances, especially when parents have communicated those concerns.\n\nOn the other hand, fire drills are important for safety and are part of the school's responsibilities. The school might have a policy that all students participate regardless of individual situations. However, if the parents informed them of the child's trauma, the school should have made an exception or prepared the child beforehand. The lack of communication when the mother dropped off the child is a red flag. They didn't check in or mention the drill, which shows they might not have taken the mother's concerns seriously.\n\nThe mother's outburst was harsh, but her frustration is justified if the school failed to accommodate her child's needs. The school's rigid adherence to procedure without empathy could be at fault here. The director's response about the calendar suggests they prioritized protocol over the child's well-being, which is problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The school might be at fault for not adjusting the fire drill for a child with recent trauma, even if it's part of their standard procedures. The mother's anger is a reaction to the school's negligence in considering her child's situation. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
