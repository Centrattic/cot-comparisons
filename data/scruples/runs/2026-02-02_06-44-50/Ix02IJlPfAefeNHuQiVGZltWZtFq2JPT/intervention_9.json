I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given story is in the wrong. The story is about a parent who was upset with their child's pre-K school for conducting a fire drill right after their house fire, which left their son traumatized.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The parent had just gone through a traumatic experience with their family, including a house fire. They wanted to maintain some normalcy for their son by continuing his pre-K attendance. The school did a fire drill, which the parent found inappropriate given the recent trauma. The parent was angry and confronted the director, who defended the decision because it was on the calendar and the child needed to be prepared.\n\nThe parent is now questioning if their reaction was justified. The user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but is seeking opinions.\n\nNow, considering the school's responsibility: schools are supposed to make decisions in the best interest of the children's safety and well-being. However, in this case, the school might have overlooked the specific circumstances of the child's trauma. The parent had informed the school about the fire the night before, so the school should have been aware of the child's vulnerability. Conducting a surprise fire drill without considering the child's emotional state could be seen as negligence. The fact that the teacher didn't mention the drill when the parent dropped off the child is a red flag. The school's reasoning, that it was on the calendar and the child needed to be prepared, doesn't account for the child's recent trauma.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent did get angry and confrontational, which might not have been the best approach, but the school's actions were questionable. The parent's anger was a reaction to the school's failure to accommodate a clearly distressing situation for the child. The school's failure to communicate the drill and consider the child's specific needs seems to be the main issue here. Therefore, the parent might be justified in their anger, even if their reaction was harsh. The school's actions contributed significantly to the problem.\n"
