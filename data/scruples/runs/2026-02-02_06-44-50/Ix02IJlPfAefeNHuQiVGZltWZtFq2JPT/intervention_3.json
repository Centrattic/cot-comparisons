I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for yelling at their son's pre-K school after a fire drill incident. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the family had a house fire, which is a traumatic event. The kid was sent to pre-K two days later to maintain some normalcy. The mom called the director to inform them about the situation. When she dropped off the kid, she met with the teacher but didn't check the calendar, which had the fire drill scheduled. The school proceeded with the drill without informing the mom, leading to the child being upset because he couldn't understand why his family wasn't there.\n\nThe mom was angry and yelled at the director. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take. So, need to consider both sides.\n\nFrom the school's perspective, fire drills are part of safety protocols. They might have followed standard procedures, assuming that informing the parents when they enrolled or through the calendar was sufficient. But the mom had specifically informed them about the recent trauma, so they should have been aware and adjusted accordingly. The school didn't check in with her at drop-off to confirm if any precautions were needed. That's a problem.\n\nThe mother's reaction was intense, but understandable given the circumstances. Her child was already in a stressful situation due to the fire, and the drill worsened his anxiety. The school's failure to accommodate a child's specific needs, especially after being informed, seems like a misstep. The director's response about the calendar being a reason is dismissive. Parents aren't expected to monitor every detail of the calendar, especially when they've communicated directly with the staff.\n\nHowever, the mom could have checked the calendar herself or asked more questions at drop-off. But considering she was dealing with a traumatic situation and had just informed them, expecting her to remember to check the calendar might be unreasonable. The school had an obligation to ensure the child's safety and emotional well-being, which they failed to do here.\n\nSo, the blame isn't entirely on the mother. The school made the mistake of not adjusting the drill given the child's recent trauma. The mom's anger is justified, and her reaction, while perhaps harsh, stems from concern for her child. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
