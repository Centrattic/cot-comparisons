I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who yelled at their child's pre-K director is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The parent's house caught fire when their son was 3. They sent him to school two days later to maintain normalcy. The school did a fire drill without informing the parent, which upset the child because he didn't understand and thought his family wasn't coming back. The parent got angry and confronted the director, who said the drill was on the calendar and the parent didn't check it.\n\nSo, the question is whether the parent overreacted or was in the right. The parent's justification is that their child just went through a traumatic event (a house fire), and the school didn't communicate the drill despite the parent informing them of the situation. The director's response was dismissive, citing the calendar.\n\nThe parent's anger seems justified because they had already informed the school of their child's trauma. The school should have been aware and made accommodations. Not checking the calendar might be on the parent, but the school's failure to communicate despite the warning is a problem. The parent was trying to keep things stable and safe for their child, and the school's action was negligent in that context. \n\nThe parent's reaction was harsh, but the director's lack of empathy and failure to adjust for the child's situation likely escalated the situation. So, the parent is not in the wrong because the school didn't take the necessary precautions after being informed. They might have handled the confrontation differently, but their anger is understandable.\n"
