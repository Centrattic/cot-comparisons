I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong after yelling at their son's pre-K school for doing a fire drill.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The kid had just experienced a house fire, and the school did a fire drill without considering his recent trauma. The parent was upset and confronted the director. The question is whether the parent was wrong to do that.\n\nSo, the key points: The child recently went through a traumatic event. The school followed their normal procedures, including fire drills, which were on the calendar. The parent didn't check the calendar, but they had informed the school about the fire. The school didn't adjust the drill for the child, leading to his distress. The parent was angry and confronted the director.\n\nNow, considering the parent's perspective: They were trying to keep their child's routine normal after a traumatic event. They had communicated the situation to the teacher but maybe not everyone. The school didn't adjust the drill, which could have been seen as insensitive. The parent's reaction, while harsh, might be understandable given the context.\n\nOn the other hand, the school has a responsibility to conduct safety drills as part of their procedures. The calendar notice was there, and perhaps the parent should have checked it. The director's response that it was on the calendar might have been a bit dismissive, but schools have policies to follow for safety reasons.\n\nBut the main issue is whether the parent was wrong. The parent's anger stems from their child's trauma and the school's failure to accommodate. Schools should be prepared for such situations, maybe by informing parents of upcoming drills so they can prepare their children, especially in sensitive cases. The parent had informed the school of the situation, so the school should have made an exception, like skipping the drill for that child or informing the parent in advance. The director's response was probably inadequate, contributing to the parent's frustration.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parent might not be in the wrong for being upset. While their reaction was harsh, the school's handling of the situation left room for improvement. The parent had a valid reason to be upset given the context. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
