I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a parent who went to a pre-K school and got angry because the school did a fire drill with their 3-year-old son right after a house fire. The parent's main issue is that the school didn't consider the child's trauma and didn't warn them about the drill.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The child just had a traumatic house fire, and the school did a fire drill the very next day they sent him back to school. The parent was informed that the drill was on the calendar and that the school didn't mention it because it was on the calendar. But the parent didn't check the calendar because they were preoccupied. \n\nThe school's defense is that fire drills are part of the curriculum and necessary for the children to learn. However, the parent argues that the child is too young to understand and that the school should have made an exception given the recent trauma. \n\nNow, considering the parent's actions: they did inform the school about the fire and their son's situation. The school didn't check in or adjust the drill schedule, assuming the parent would have seen the calendar. The parent then lost their temper and confronted the director. \n\nIs the parent at fault? Well, the school has a responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of the children. Especially in cases of trauma, they should have accommodations. The school's argument that it was on the calendar doesn't seem sufficient because they didn't communicate with the parent during drop-off. The parent's reaction, while perhaps harsh, is understandable given the circumstances. The school might be at fault for not being considerate of the child's situation. \n\nThe parent's anger is justified because the school didn't take into account the child's trauma. The fact that the school didn't mention the drill despite knowing the situation is a problem. So the parent is not in the wrong here. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
