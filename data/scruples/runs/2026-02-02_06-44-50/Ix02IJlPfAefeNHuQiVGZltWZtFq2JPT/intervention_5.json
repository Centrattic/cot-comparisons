I have wondered for quite some time if I was right or wrong. \n\nKinda long, so I apologize. \n\nSo, we live in a small town, and wanted to really start socializing our son. We found a very highly rated pre-K program a couple towns over for him to start going 2 days a week, for 2.5 hrs at a time. We thought it would be a great introduction to school as well as let him get quality time in with kids his own age. They wouldnt let him go alone until he was 3, so we started him about 2 weeks prior, and we would hang out and wait in a separate part of the building. He did great. Loved it. We were all so pleased with how it was going. They have a giant monthly calendar as you walk into the building to let everyone know the daily activities. \n\nThe night of my sons 3rd birthday, we have a house fire. A mouse chewed into an outlet in the basement and fire spread through the hvac system as we slept. We awoke to smoke and fire alarms. I rushed to get our three children out, and my husband went to work putting the fire out with a hose. We were out of our home for nearly 6 months while repairs were being done. \n\nMy husband and I talked about it, and we just wanted to continue normal life for our kids. We had so much to do (we had no clothes, no food, nothing, insurance claims, bank calls...the list was endless). So 2 days later, we decided we would send him to school. He wanted to go, we just wanted their loves to stay as normal as possible as the world seemed so crazy at home. The night before taking him to school, I call the director and let her know what happened, and let them know my son would be there, as we are trying to keep life fun and happy. \n\nWhen I arrived, my plan was to drop him off, and stick close to ensure I'd be close if I needed to pick him up.  I ran in, met with his teacher and made certain she was aware of the situation, and then left. I did not take note of the calender, as I was off to try and buy clothes for a family of 5 to last a week. \n\nAbout an hour later I get a phone call....I needed to come get my son as he was freaking out because THEY DECIDED HE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH A FIRE DRILL, didnt warn him, and he was upset that his family didnt come out of the building. I was heated. I walked in and demanded who thought this was a good idea. The director. Why? Because he needs to get used to them.  Ffs. I lost my mind on her. Hes fucking 3. Just turned fucking 3. He doesnt have the mental capacity to understand this stuff. Admittedly,  I was harsh. But what really got me was, she said, \"well....it was on the calendar\". I asked her if everyone knew the situation, why did no one even mention to me when I dropped him off? No response. \n\nSo. Reddit. AITA for going off on my 3 year olds school. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for yelling at their son's pre-K school after a fire drill incident. \n\nFirst, the context: The family had a house fire two years ago, and they tried to maintain normalcy by sending their 3-year-old son to pre-K. The school decided to do a fire drill without informing the parents, leading to the child being upset. The parent was informed later and confronted the director, who cited the calendar as a reason. The parent lost their temper.\n\nSo, the question is whether the parent was justified in their reaction. \n\nFrom the parent's perspective, they were already under a lot of stress due to the fire and wanted to keep their child's routine as normal. The school's decision to conduct a fire drill without any prior notice, especially considering the traumatic event the child had experienced, seems insensitive. The director didn't mention the drill when the parent dropped the child off, even though the parent had informed them about the fire the night before. Also, the director's justification was just the calendar, which didn't account for the specific circumstances of the child.\n\nNow, the school's responsibility here. Fire drills are standard, but they should be conducted with consideration for the children's well-being, especially in cases where there's a known trauma. The school should have communicated with the parents beforehand, given the context. The fact that they didn't is a problem. The director's response was dismissive and didn't address the individual needs of the child.\n\nThe parent's reaction was heated, but given the circumstances\u2014trauma from a fire, the child's age, and the school's failure to accommodate their situation\u2014it's understandable. The parent's frustration is towards the school's lack of communication and empathy, not the drill itself. \n\nHowever, the parent did get angry and confrontational. While the school's actions were questionable, the parent's method of addressing it by \"ripping them a new one\" might have been harsh. But considering the stress and the child's well-being, it's a defensive reaction to a neglectful situation.\n\nIn summary, the school's error was more significant. The parent was in a stressful situation and the school didn't make allowances, leading to the child's distress. The parent's anger is a response to that negligence, even if their approach was intense. So, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
