My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the person yelling at their sister for eating cough drops that they were planning to sell on eBay for $45, which they ended up making a $35 profit on. The sister ate them, not knowing their value, and the author got really upset, yelled at her, and now their relationship is strained. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author had a legitimate expectation to sell those cough drops for a profit. They spent time and effort setting up the auction, and the sister's action of eating them without knowing their value disrupted that. The author was probably frustrated, especially since the sale had already happened. But did they have the right to yell and cause a rift over it?\n\nOn the other hand, the sister didn't know the cough drops were valuable. She just liked the taste. Maybe she thought they were regular cough drops. The author kept them in their closet, which might not have been a place the sister would look, but maybe they should have stored them more securely since they were for sale. The author's reaction seems extreme for a $35 mistake. Yelling and causing their sister to leave without talking for a month seems disproportionate, especially considering the sister was in college and the author was probably still living at home.\n\nThe author did take steps to make amends by driving to their sister's college to apologize, which is a good move. They also adjusted their behavior by not making their sister pay for them, acknowledging it was an honest mistake. So maybe the author realized their mistake in overreacting. But the initial reaction was definitely harsh. \n\nIn terms of fault, the sister's action was unintentional. The author's responsibility could be in not properly securing their items that were for sale. If the items were stored where the sister might access them, maybe they should have been more careful. However, the sister eating them was not malicious. The author's response was the main issue here\u2014yelling and causing emotional harm over a financial loss that, while real, doesn't justify the emotional toll on the relationship.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's mistake was in the reaction. They were upset about the loss, but the way they handled it was wrong. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong). But wait, maybe there's a middle ground. The sister's mistake was there, but the author's reaction was excessive. So the author is at least partially at fault. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the sister didn't know, the author should have handled it calmly. So yes, the author is in the wrong for overreacting.\n"
