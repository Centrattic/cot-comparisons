My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a sister eating cough drops that the author was selling for $45, leading to a fight and the sister going back to college without talking to the author since. The author then goes on to apologize and drive to her college, but the sister didn't know about the item's value.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author put a lot of effort into selling the cough drops, maybe even had a specific buyer in mind. Losing that item would be frustrating. But yelling at the sister over something she didn't realize was valuable might be an overreaction. The sister just ate them because she liked the taste, which seems like an honest mistake. \n\nThe author's reaction was yelling, which is emotional and intense. The sister felt shaken up and left, which is a significant consequence for a misunderstanding. The author later apologized and tried to make amends, which is good, but the initial reaction was harsh. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the sister didn't know about the logo or the value. If the item was clearly marked or stored in a way that indicated its value, maybe the sister should have known. But if it was just in the author's closet, maybe the author didn't take adequate steps to secure it. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the sister made an honest mistake, but the author should have considered the importance of the item and maybe stored it more securely. However, the anger and yelling after the fact were probably excessive given that the sister had no malicious intent. \n\nThe fact that the author later apologized and set ground rules shows they realized their mistake. The sister's reaction of leaving might have been overreacting too, but the initial conflict was the author's yelling. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's overreaction led to a breakdown in the relationship, even if it was due to a mistake. Therefore, the author might be at least partially in the wrong for how they handled the situation.\n"
