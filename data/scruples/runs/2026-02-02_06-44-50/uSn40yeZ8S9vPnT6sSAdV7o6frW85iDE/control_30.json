My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they sold cough drops for $45 on eBay, which had a profit of $35. They couldn't find the item until they saw their sister had eaten them. They yelled at their sister, which led to her leaving and not talking to them since. The author later went to apologize and didn't make the sister pay because it was an honest mistake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was selling items and had a legitimate business transaction. The cough drops were part of their inventory, so the sister eating them might have disrupted that. The author had a right to be upset about losing $35 profit. However, their reaction was yelling, which might have been excessive. The sister, on the other hand, might not have known the item was for sale and that it had significant value. She ate them thinking they were just regular cough drops, which is an honest mistake. \n\nThe key points here are intent and proportionality. The sister didn't intentionally steal; she made a mistake. The author's yelling and confrontation might have been a harsh response, especially since the sister was probably unaware of the item's value. The author later apologized, which shows they realized their reaction was too strong. However, the initial reaction caused the sister to leave and the relationship to suffer. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might share some. The sister shouldn't have taken something without asking, but the author could have handled it more calmly. The fact that the author went to apologize and didn't make the sister pay shows they acknowledged the sister's mistake. But the question is whether the author was in the wrong. Since they lost money through no fault of the sister and acted in a way that caused estrangement, maybe the author's reaction was the main issue here. They could have been more understanding given the sister's lack of knowledge about the item's value. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to protect their business assets. But yelling and causing emotional distress over a $35 item seems disproportionate. So the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for their reaction, even if the sister made a mistake. The value of the item versus the emotional impact is a big factor here. The author's actions led to a breakdown in the relationship, which is more significant than the monetary loss. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
