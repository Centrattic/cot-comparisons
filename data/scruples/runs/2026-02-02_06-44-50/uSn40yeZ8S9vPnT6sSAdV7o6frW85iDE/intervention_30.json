My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The sister ate them, and the person got upset, yelled, and the sister went back to college. The author later apologized and didn't make the sister pay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The cough drops were part of an eBay auction, so they had value beyond just the item\u2014they were a product for sale. The sister ate them, which caused the author to lose the item and possibly the sale. The author was upset because they made a profit, so losing the item could mean losing that profit. \n\nBut on the other hand, the sister might not have known the value or the eBay context. The author admits they yelled a lot, which could be excessive. The sister's reaction was to leave, which might indicate she felt hurt. The author later took steps to make amends, which is a positive action.\n\nSo, was the author in the wrong? They might have overreacted by yelling, especially considering the sister's mistake was unintentional. The author's reaction led to a strained relationship, which is significant. Even though the sister ate the cough drops, the author's response of yelling and maybe being overly harsh could be seen as the problem. However, the fact that the author apologized and tried to fix things mitigates some of the blame. \n\nBut the key point is whether the initial reaction was appropriate. Yelling might be an overreaction for an honest mistake, especially in a sibling relationship. Siblings often share spaces, and maybe clearer communication about the item's purpose could have prevented this. The sister's lack of awareness about the value might mean she didn't intend to cause harm. So, the author's anger being directed at the sister for an honest mistake could be seen as the wrong part.\n\nSo, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because they overreacted to an honest mistake, even though they tried to make amends later.\n"
