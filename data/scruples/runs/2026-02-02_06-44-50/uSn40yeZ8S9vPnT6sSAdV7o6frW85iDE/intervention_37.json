My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. So, first, the sister ate the cough drops, which the author was selling on eBay and ended up making $35 profit. The author got really upset, yelled at her sister, and the sister left. Now they feel bad and are trying to fix things by apologizing.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about how the author reacted. Yelling at someone over something that, in the big picture, might be a small amount of money. The sister didn't know the value of the item, as mentioned in Edit 2. The author made a mistake by getting angry over an honest mistake. The sister's action was innocent, but the author overreacted. The fact that the author is now taking steps to make amends is a good sign, but the initial reaction was excessive.\n\nAlso, considering that the cough drops were being sold online, maybe the sister wasn't supposed to have access to them. But if they were in a shared space, maybe the author didn't secure them properly. However, the main issue is the reaction. The author prioritized money over their relationship, leading to a rift. The sister's reaction of leaving suggests that the yelling was really hurtful. \n\nSo, while the sister did eat the item, the author's yelling was an overreaction. The amount involved was $45, which isn't huge, and the sister didn't know their value. The author's reaction caused more harm than necessary. Therefore, the author is at fault for overreacting.\n"
