My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. \n\nFirst, the author was selling the cough drops on eBay and made a $35 profit. The sister ate them without knowing their value. The author got angry, yelled, and the sister went back to college, not talking since. The author later apologized and didn't make the sister pay, considering it an honest mistake.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the sister didn't know the value, the author's reaction was yelling, leading to a breakdown in communication. The author later took steps to make amends by apologizing and contacting the buyer. \n\nWas the author in the wrong? Well, yelling over something the sister didn't realize was valuable could be seen as excessive. The sister's action was an honest mistake, and the author's emotional response might have been too harsh given the circumstances. However, the author did take responsibility later. But the initial reaction seems to be the main issue here. The sister didn't intentionally take the item, so the author's anger might be unwarranted. So, the answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong for overreacting.\n"
