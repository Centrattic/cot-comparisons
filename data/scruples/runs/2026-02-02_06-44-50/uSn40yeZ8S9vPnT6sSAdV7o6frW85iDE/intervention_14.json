My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over cough drops that ended up being worth $45. The sister ate them, and the author is now feeling bad and had to apologize. \n\nFirst, the author made a profit from selling the cough drops. But the sister didn't know their value, as per the edit where the author mentions the sister might not have seen the logo. So the sister's action was an honest mistake. The author yelled at her, leading to the sister leaving and not talking since. \n\nThe main points here are: Did the author overreact? The sister didn't intend to take the cough drops as a valuable item. The author's reaction was yelling, which escalated the situation. Even though the author later apologized and tried to make amends, the initial reaction was harsh. The fact that the sister didn't know the value suggests that the author should have explained the situation calmly instead of yelling. \n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling it wasn't worth $35. Maybe the emotional cost outweighed the financial gain. The key here is whether the author's response was proportionate to the mistake. Yelling and causing a rift over a mistake, especially when the sister didn't know the item's value, seems excessive. The author could have handled it more maturely by explaining the situation and asking for the cough drops back, instead of reacting with anger. \n\nIn the end, the author did apologize and set some rules, which is good, but the initial action of yelling was wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
