My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author was selling cough drops on eBay for $45, made a $35 profit, but then their sister ate them. The author got really angry, yelled at her, and now their sister is upset and hasn't talked to them since. The author is wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the value of the cough drops. $45 seems high for cough drops. Maybe they were designer or special edition? The author mentions \"Supreme cough drops,\" which might be a brand they're using for their eBay listings. But Supreme is actually a streetwear brand, not cough drops, so maybe that's a typo or a joke. Anyway, the key point is that the author sold them for $45, which is a lot for something that's typically not expensive. So the author probably felt that the sister was wasteful or didn't understand the value.\n\nThe sister ate them without knowing their worth. The author confronted her and yelled, which led to the sister leaving. The author later apologized and explained that the sister didn't know the value. The author didn't make the sister pay, just set some ground rules. Now the question is whether the author was wrong in yelling.\n\nIn terms of responsibility: The sister was in her own room, and the cough drops were in the author's closet. Did the author store them securely? If they were left accessible, maybe the sister didn't realize they were for sale. But the author is responsible for their own items. However, the reaction of yelling might have been excessive for an honest mistake. The sister didn't steal with intent; she just ate them. The author made a profit, but the emotional cost is high.\n\nAlso, the author took initiative to apologize and make amends, which is a good step. The sister's reaction of leaving might be because she felt attacked over something she didn't realize was so valuable. The author's anger over $35 profit might be disproportionate, especially compared to the relationship with their sister. So while the author isn't wrong for being upset, the yelling and the resulting fallout suggest that their reaction was too harsh given the sister's lack of intent to harm.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they overreacted to an honest mistake, which damaged their relationship unnecessarily. The sister didn't mean to cause harm, and the author's response was excessive for the situation.\n"
