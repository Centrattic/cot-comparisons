My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about their sister eating cough drops that were sold for $45, leading to a conflict and the sister returning to college.\n\nFirst, the author bought something, listed it on eBay, and the item sold for $45. They lost it because their sister ate them. Then they yelled at her, which caused the sister to leave and not talk to them. The author later went to apologize but still set some rules.\n\nI need to determine if the author was wrong. The key points are the value of the item, the sister's actions, and the author's reaction. The cough drops were sold for $45, so they had some value to the author. But the sister ate them without knowing their worth, maybe. The author's reaction was yelling, which escalated the situation. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe the author was wrong for yelling and overreacting. The sister made an honest mistake. The fact that the author later apologized and didn't make the sister pay shows they recognized their mistake. So the initial reaction was wrong, but they took steps to fix it. \n\nThe sister's perspective is important here. She didn't know the value, so the author should have been understanding. Yelling was excessive. However, the author did make amends. So overall, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the overreaction, even though they fixed it later.\n"
