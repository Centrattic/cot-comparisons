My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The situation is that the sister ate the cough drops which the author was selling on eBay, leading to a profit of $35. The sister went back to college and they haven't talked since. The author later apologized and drove to college to make amends.\n\nHmm, so first, the main issue here is whether the author overreacted. The sister ate the cough drops, not knowing they were for sale. The author made a profit, so the actual loss was $10 (since $45 sale price minus $10 cost, maybe? Wait, the author mentions making $35 profit, so maybe the original cost was $10 and sold for $45. So total profit is $35. So the actual item's cost was $10, but the sister ate it before the sale. So the author lost the item but had already made $35 profit. Wait, maybe I need to clarify that. The author was running an auction for the cough drops, which ended at $45, giving a $35 profit. But the sister ate them before the sale happened. Wait, no, the author was supposed to deliver them after the sale. So if the sister ate them, the author couldn't deliver and had to inform the buyer. The author then had to explain the situation, and the buyer gave a 3-star review. So the actual loss here is the $35 profit and the item itself. But the sister didn't know the value, just ate them because she liked the taste. \n\nNow, the author yelled at the sister for this. The sister's perspective is that it's just cough drops, not realizing their monetary value. The author took this seriously, leading the sister to leave. The author later apologized but still set some ground rules. The question is whether the author was wrong in yelling. \n\nLooking at the details, the sister made an honest mistake. She didn't know the cough drops were for sale. The author's reaction was yelling, which might be considered excessive given the sister's intent. While the author did lose money, the sister had no malicious intent. The author's emotional response might be seen as disproportionate. Additionally, the author took the initiative to apologize and resolve the situation, which is a positive step. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a grey area. The sister is at fault for eating the cough drops, but the author's reaction could be seen as over the top. The value of the item was high due to being sold on eBay, but the sister didn't know that. The author's profit was $35, which is significant, but yelling and causing a rift might not be worth it. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author probably overreacted. The sister's mistake was honest, and yelling seems excessive. The author should have been more understanding, especially since the sister didn't act with malice. However, the author did take responsibility by apologizing, which shows they realized the mistake in their reaction. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they overreacted to an honest mistake, even though they later made amends.\n"
