My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over expensive cough drops. The situation involves a family conflict that led to a rift. \n\nFirst, the author sold the cough drops for $45, which they found out was eaten by their sister. They yelled at her, leading to the sister leaving and not talking since. The author later apologized and drove to her college, but there's a lingering question about who's at fault.\n\nSo, considering the facts: The sister ate the cough drops without knowing their value. The author was upset because it was a profitable item they were supposed to deliver. However, the author's reaction was yelling, which escalated the situation. The sister's action was an honest mistake\u2014she didn't know the drops were for sale. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the sister made a mistake but didn't intend to cause harm. The author's response, while understandable in frustration, was harsh. The author later took steps to apologize and resolve the issue, which shows they realized their part in the conflict. \n\nTherefore, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but they did overreact. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the sister's action was unintentional and the author's response was excessive, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong. But maybe not entirely, because the sister's mistake was real. But considering that the author was angry over money but then made amends, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the main issue is that the author yelled, which is typically seen as a wrong action in such a scenario. So the answer might be A.\n"
