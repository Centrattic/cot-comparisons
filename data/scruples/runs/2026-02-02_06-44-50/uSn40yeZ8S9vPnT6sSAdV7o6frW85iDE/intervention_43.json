My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author yelling at their sister for eating cough drops they sold on eBay for $45. The sister went back to college and they haven't talked since. The author later apologized and went to her college to make things right, but the sister still left a 3-star review.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: the author was selling the cough drops, the sister ate them unintentionally, the author yelled, and then took steps to apologize. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to figure out if that's accurate.\n\nFirst, the author made a profit from the sale, which was their intention. The sister didn't know the value of the item and ate them. The author's reaction was yelling, which might have been excessive. However, the author later took responsibility by apologizing and even not making the sister pay, which shows they realized their mistake. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister's action was an honest mistake. She didn't intend to take the product, so maybe the author overreacted. But the author had a right to be upset about losing the item they were selling. The emotional response of yelling might have been too harsh given the circumstances. The sister's reaction of leaving and not talking since suggests the yelling was hurtful. \n\nThe author's follow-up actions (apologizing, driving to her college) indicate they acknowledged their mistake. So while the initial reaction might have been wrong, the author made amends. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the sister didn't know the value, so the author should have considered that. Yelling might have been an overreaction. But the author did correct their mistake. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because yelling over an honest mistake, even if they later apologized, shows that the initial reaction was inappropriate. However, the follow-up actions mitigate some of the blame. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would still be A.\n"
