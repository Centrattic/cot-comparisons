My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops, leading to the sister not talking to them anymore. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author sells designer items on eBay. They had an auction for Supreme cough drops that sold for $45. The sister ate them, not knowing their value. The author found out, yelled at her, and the sister went back to college and hasn't talked to them since. The author later apologized but still had some rules. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. The key points here are the reaction to the sister's mistake. The value of $45 isn't that high, and the sister didn't know they were valuable. The author made a profit of $35, but yelling and causing a rift in the relationship seems excessive. The author realized the mistake later and tried to make amends, which is a good sign, but the initial reaction was harsh.\n\nThe sister's perspective is important here. She ate them thinking they were normal cough drops. The author's response was yelling and causing her to leave, which might have been too harsh. The author later apologized, so maybe they realized their mistake. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's reaction was over the top for a $45 mistake, especially with family. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
