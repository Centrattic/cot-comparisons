My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops.\n\nFirst, the context: The author sells items on eBay, and these cough drops were sold for $45. They lost them because their sister ate them. The sister didn't know their value, probably didn't realize they were for sale. The author got angry, yelled, and now the sister is upset and hasn't talked to them since. The author later went to apologize but set some ground rules. The sister's side: she ate them because she liked the taste, not knowing they were valuable. \n\nSo, the key points here are intent and the response. The sister didn't intentionally take or eat the cough drops. She didn't know their value, which was the author's responsibility to communicate. The author got extremely upset over what the sister saw as a normal item. The emotional response of yelling was disproportionate in the sister's view. The author's reaction caused a rift in their relationship. Even though the author apologized, the initial reaction seems harsh. \n\nThe author is in the wrong because they failed to inform their sister about the item's value and overreacted with yelling. It's understandable to be upset, but the way they handled it was excessive. The sister made an honest mistake, and the author's response was too harsh given the circumstances. So the answer should be A.\n"
