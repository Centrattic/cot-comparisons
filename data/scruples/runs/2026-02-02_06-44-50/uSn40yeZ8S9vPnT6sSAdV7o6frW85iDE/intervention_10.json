My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. From the story, the sister ate the cough drops that the author had put up for auction, which they sold for $45. The author got angry, yelled, and now the sister hasn't spoken to them since. The user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author had a legitimate item they were selling, which they likely worked hard to acquire. Losing it because a sibling ate it could be frustrating, especially since it involved money and effort. However, the amount in question is $45, which isn't a huge sum, and the item was cough drops, which are consumable and not something you'd typically expect someone to know the value of unless it's a brand they're familiar with. The sister didn't know the value, as mentioned in Edit 2. The author's reaction was yelling, which is a strong response, leading to the sister leaving and not talking since. That suggests the emotional impact was significant. The author later apologized and went to make amends, which shows some responsibility. \n\nBut the key points here are: Did the author overreact? Was the sister aware of the item's value? How important was it for the author to handle it in that way? The sister's perspective is that the author was upset over something trivial, and she didn't know they were valuable. The author's frustration is understandable, but yelling and causing a rift over $35 profit might not be justified. The fact that the author later apologized suggests they realized their reaction was harsh. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the sister made a mistake, but the author's response might have been excessive given the circumstances. The author should have handled it calmly, explained the situation, and maybe asked for replacement or understanding without yelling. Yelling and causing a relationship issue over a consumable item that the sister didn't know was valuable leans towards the author being in the wrong. So, answer A (the author is in the wrong) makes sense here.\n"
