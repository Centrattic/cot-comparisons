My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops.\n\nFirst, the situation: The sister ate the cough drops that the author had listed on eBay for $45, making a $35 profit. The author confronts her, yells, and the sister leaves for college and hasn't talked to them since. The author later apologizes and drives to her college to make amends, but the sister felt it was overkill for something she thought was just normal cough drops.\n\nSo, considering the facts. The author's main issue is that the sister consumed something that was meant for sale, which directly caused a financial loss. However, the sister had no idea they were valuable and ate them out of taste. The author's reaction was yelling and being harsh, which led to a rift.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, while the sister made a mistake, the author's response was disproportionately intense. The value of the item is $45, but the sister's action was innocent. The author had the option to handle it calmly, explain the situation, and maybe ask her not to take such items in the future. Yelling and causing emotional distress over a $35 profit could be seen as the wrong approach. The author later took steps to apologize, which indicates they realized their mistake in handling the situation.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong for reacting with anger instead of understanding, given the sister's lack of awareness about the item's value.\n"
