My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author yelled at their sister for eating cough drops they were selling on eBay, which ended up being worth $45. They feel terrible about it and tried to make amends by apologizing and not making the sister pay, but the buyer left a 3-star review.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The key points are: the author was selling items, including these cough drops, which their sister ate without knowing their value. The author got angry and yelled, leading to the sister leaving and not talking to them. The author then apologized and resolved it without making the sister pay, but the buyer was upset.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? Well, the sister didn't know the cough drops were for sale and ate them. The author was upset about losing $35 profit. Yelling at the sister seems disproportionate, especially since the sister didn't intend to cause harm. The author's reaction led to a rift in their relationship, which they later tried to fix. However, the initial reaction was harsh. On the other hand, the sister's mistake was understandable if the cough drops were in a shared space. The author should have communicated better about the items being for sale and perhaps kept them in a more secure place. Yelling over a mistake, even if it's about money, can be seen as overreacting. The fact that the author took steps to apologize shows they recognized their wrongdoing. The buyer's negative review might also reflect the stress of the situation, but that's more about the author's ability to handle the sale than the sister's actions. So overall, the author was in the wrong for overreacting and yelling at the sister for an honest mistake, even if they later made amends.\n"
