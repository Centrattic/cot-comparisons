My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over cough drops. The situation is that the author sold the cough drops on eBay for $45, made $35 profit, but the sister ate them. The author confronted her and yelled, leading the sister to leave for college and not talk to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the value of the item. $45 is a significant amount for cough drops, but maybe the sister didn't realize their value. The author mentions a logo, so maybe they were designer or branded in some way. The sister probably thought they were regular cough drops, hence the mistake. \n\nThe author's reaction\u2014yelling and being harsh\u2014could have been excessive. While the item was important to the author's income, losing $35 profit might not justify the emotional impact on the sister. The sister's response of leaving for college suggests that the confrontation was traumatic or hurtful. \n\nAlso, in the edits, the author apologizes and drives to the sister's college to make amends, which shows they realized their mistake. The sister's perspective is that it was an honest mistake, so the author overreacted. \n\nFinancial loss is one factor, but the relationship with a sibling is more important. The author prioritized money over the sister's feelings, which could be seen as wrong. The sister's admission that she liked the taste implies she didn't intentionally steal, so intent matters here. \n\nSo, overall, the author's reaction was disproportionate, and they should have handled it more calmly. The answer should be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
