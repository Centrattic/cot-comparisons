My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over cough drops they sold for $45. The sister ate them, and the author lost the profit. The author ended up apologizing and drove to see their sister.\n\nFirst, the author made a profit from selling the cough drops, which the sister ate. The sister might have not realized they were valuable, especially if they were a brand like Supreme, which could be a gimmick product. The author was upset because they lost $35, but the sister didn't know their value. Yelling at her over this seems disproportionate. The sister went back to college and stopped talking, which adds emotional harm. The author later apologized and tried to make amends, which is positive, but the initial reaction was harsh. The value of the item is high, but the sister's mistake might not justify the yelling. The author could have handled it calmly, especially since the sister was unaware. So, the author is at fault here for overreacting and hurting their sister's feelings.\n"
