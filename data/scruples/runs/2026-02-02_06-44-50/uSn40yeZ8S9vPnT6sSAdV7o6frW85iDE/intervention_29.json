My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about them yelling at their sister for eating $45 cough drops they were selling on eBay. The sister went back to college and they haven't talked since. The author later went to apologize and explained the situation to the buyer, who gave a 3-star review.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were wrong. The key points here are: the value of the item, the sister's perspective, and the author's response. The cough drops were part of a business venture, so losing them could have been a significant loss. But the sister didn't know their value and just ate them because she liked the taste. The author yelled at her, which led to a rift in their relationship. \n\nThe author did apologize and take steps to fix the situation, which might mitigate some blame. However, yelling over a misunderstanding where the sister didn't intend to cause harm could be seen as excessive. The author's reaction seems to be the main issue here. The sister's actions were innocent, and the author's response was harsh, leading to a breakdown in their relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that the cough drops were for sale and had monetary value, so losing them due to a sister's carelessness was frustrating. However, the value of the relationship versus the $35 profit is a key factor. The author later realized it wasn't worth the conflict and made amends, which is a positive step. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's initial reaction was probably too harsh given the circumstances. The sister didn't know the value, and the author's yelling caused lasting damage. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
