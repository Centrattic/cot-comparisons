My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. \n\nFirst, the situation: The sister ate the cough drops that the author was selling, leading to a profit of $35. The author got upset, yelled at the sister, and the sister left for college and didn't talk to them since. The author later went to apologize but still set some rules.\n\nSo, the key points here. The sister didn't know the value of the items or their purpose. The author's reaction was yelling and being harsh, which led to a rift in their relationship. The sister's mistake was innocent\u2014she just liked the taste. The author acknowledges it was an honest mistake and chose not to make the sister pay, which shows some leniency. However, the initial reaction of yelling and causing emotional harm seems excessive for the situation. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the sister's action was accidental and without malicious intent. The author's response was disproportionate. Relationships are important, and losing a sibling's trust over a material item, even if it's a significant profit, might be considered a wrong choice. The author did take steps to mend things by apologizing, which is good, but the initial action was harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had the right to be upset about losing a product they were selling for profit. However, the way they handled it\u2014yelling and causing their sister to leave\u2014could be seen as the wrong approach. The value of the relationship versus the financial loss is a key factor here. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's reaction was too harsh given the sister's innocent mistake, leading to a broken relationship. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
