My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about yelling at a sister for eating cough drops that were sold for $45. The author set up an eBay auction for Supreme cough drops and sold them for that price, made a $35 profit, but then the sister ate them. The author confronted her, yelled, and now the sister went back to college and hasn't talked since. The author later apologized and went to her college.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are the value of the item, the sister's awareness of its value, and the author's reaction. The sister ate the cough drops, but did she know they were valuable? The author mentions the sister said she liked the taste. The author also mentions the brand, which might be a high-end product, but maybe the sister didn't notice the logo or brand. That's an important detail because if she didn't know they were worth $45, her mistake was honest. \n\nThe author's reaction was yelling, which is a strong response. Even though the item was valuable to the author, the sister might not have known. The author's emotional response led to a breakdown in their relationship. However, the author did go to apologize and set boundaries, which shows some responsibility. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the sister made an honest mistake, but the author's reaction was excessive. The value of the item is subjective, but yelling and causing a rift seems harsh. The author could have handled it more calmly, especially since it's a family member. However, the sister's lack of awareness about the item's value might mitigate some blame. \n\nThe author's follow-up actions (apologizing) show they realized their mistake, but the initial reaction was wrong. So the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the reaction was disproportionate to the sister's mistake, especially if she didn't know the value. The author should have explained the situation more calmly instead of yelling.\n"
