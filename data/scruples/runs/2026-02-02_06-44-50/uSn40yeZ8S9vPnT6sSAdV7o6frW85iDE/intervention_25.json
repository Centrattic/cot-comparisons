My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The situation involves the sister eating the cough drops that the author was selling on eBay. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the value of the item. $45 for cough drops might seem high to some, but the author made a $35 profit. The sister had no idea about their value, as she just liked the taste. The author found out and reacted strongly, yelling at her, which led to the sister leaving and not talking since.\n\nThe author later apologized and went to her college, which shows some accountability. But the initial reaction seems excessive. The sister made an honest mistake, not knowing the item's value. Yelling at someone over an honest mistake, especially to the point of damaging a relationship, might be seen as harsh. The author's actions caused emotional harm, even if the item's value was significant to them.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had a right to be upset about losing an item they were trying to sell. However, the way they handled it\u2014yelling and causing the sister to leave\u2014might have been disproportionate. The sister's lack of knowledge about the item's value is a key point here. If the sister had known, she wouldn't have eaten them. \n\nThe author's follow-up actions (apologizing, not making the sister pay) show they recognized the mistake in their approach. But the initial reaction still needs to be evaluated. In many cases, people are expected to communicate calmly even when upset, especially within families. Yelling and causing emotional distress over a mistake, even if the item had value, could be considered wrong.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the sister's lack of knowledge, the author's disproportionate reaction, and the resulting damage to their relationship, it seems the author was in the wrong for how they handled the situation, even if the item's loss was unfortunate.\n"
