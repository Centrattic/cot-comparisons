My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about their sister eating $45 cough drops that the author was selling on eBay, leading to an argument and the sister leaving. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was selling the cough drops, which they bought and sold for profit. They put effort into that auction and were upset when they couldn't find the item. When they discovered the sister ate them, they yelled. The sister didn't know their value, just liked the taste. The author later apologized and went to visit her.\n\nSo, the author's actions: They got angry, yelled, which caused the sister to leave. But they did apologize and take responsibility by visiting. The sister's perspective is that she didn't realize the cough drops were valuable. The author made a mistake in overreacting, but then took steps to make amends. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They might be partially responsible for not keeping their items secure. If the sister didn't know they were for sale, maybe the author should have stored them better. However, the sister did take the item without permission, even if by accident. The author's yelling was an overreaction, but they did make an effort to fix things. \n\nSo, the answer could be A (yes) because they yelled and overreacted, but also B (no) because the sister made a mistake. But since the user wants a single answer, maybe A is more correct because the initial reaction was inappropriate. However, they did apologize, which shows they recognized their mistake. Hmm. Maybe the main issue is the overreaction, so the author is at least partially wrong. But the sister's action was also a mistake. I think the author is more in the wrong here for losing their temper, so answer A.\n"
