My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves them yelling at their sister for eating cough drops that were meant to be sold on eBay, which turned out to be valuable.\n\nFirst, the sister ate the cough drops without knowing their value. The author was upset because they made a profit from the sale, but the sister didn't realize the item's worth. The author reacted by yelling, which led to the sister leaving and not talking since. The author later apologized but still had some ground rules. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The main points are intent and proportionality. The sister didn't know the cough drops were valuable, so her action was an honest mistake. The author's reaction of yelling over $35 profit might be seen as excessive. The fact that the sister didn't understand the value could mitigate her responsibility. However, the author did take the initiative to apologize and resolve the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had the responsibility to store the items properly, maybe even label them as valuable. The sister eating them might be an accident, but the author's anger over a relatively small amount of money could be considered overreacting. The key here is whether the author's reaction was justified given the sister's lack of knowledge and the actual value of the item. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might share some. The sister ate them without knowing, but the author should have kept them in a place where others wouldn't access them. However, the immediate reaction of yelling seems harsh, especially considering the relationship and the amount involved. The author's follow-up action of apologizing shows they realized this, but the initial reaction might still be in their wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they overreacted given the circumstances. The sister's mistake was honest, and the value was $35, which isn't a huge amount to justify yelling and causing a rift. The author could have handled it more calmly and communicated better. However, there's a nuance here. Some might argue that the author had the right to be upset about losing money, but the response was disproportionate. The fact that they later apologized and tried to fix things is a positive, but it doesn't erase the initial wrongdoing.\n"
