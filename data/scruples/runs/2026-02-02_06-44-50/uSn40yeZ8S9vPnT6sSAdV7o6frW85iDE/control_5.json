My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author yelling at their sister for eating cough drops that were sold on eBay for $45. The sister went back to college and didn't talk to them since. The author later drove out to apologize and explained the situation to the buyer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author spent time and effort to prepare these cough drops for sale, maybe even as part of their business. Losing $35 profit might feel significant, especially if they rely on such sales. The sister, on the other hand, might not have realized the value or the intent behind the item. She ate them thinking they were regular cough drops, not knowing they were for sale.\n\nThe author's reaction was to yell, which escalated the situation. Yelling can be seen as an overreaction, especially when it comes to family. The sister's response was to leave for college, indicating she felt hurt. The fact that the author later took steps to apologize and clarify shows they realize their mistake in the yelling. However, the initial reaction was harsh. \n\nThe sister's mistake was honest, not intentional. The author could have handled it by explaining the situation calmly, maybe educating the sister about the value of the items. Yelling led to a breakdown in communication and strained the relationship. The author's decision to apologize is a good step, but the initial action of yelling was wrong. \n\nAlso, the author mentions the sister didn't know the logo or the worth, which suggests she was unaware. The author's responsibility is to communicate the value of such items to family members. The emotional response (yelling) was disproportionate to the mistake. Even though the financial loss was $35, the relationship with a sibling is more important. \n\nIn conclusion, while the sister made an honest mistake, the author's reaction was inconsiderate and overly harsh, leading to the rift. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
