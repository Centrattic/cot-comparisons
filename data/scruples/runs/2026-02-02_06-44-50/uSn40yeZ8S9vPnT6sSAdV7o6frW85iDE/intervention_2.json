My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The author sold them on eBay and then found out the sister ate them. The sister went back to college and they haven't talked since. The author later went to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's perspective. She ate the cough drops thinking they were just regular ones. The author had a specific reason to keep them for sale. The sister didn't know their value or the purpose. The author's reaction was yelling, which might have been excessive given that the sister didn't intend to do harm. Yelling can be a form of emotional harm, especially in a family context. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had an investment in those cough drops and might have felt justified in being upset. However, the way they handled it\u2014yelling\u2014could have been the main issue. The sister might have felt attacked, leading her to leave. The author later took action to fix the situation by apologizing, which shows they realized their mistake.\n\nThe key factors here are intent and proportionality. The sister didn't mean to cause harm, and the author's reaction was harsh. While the cough drops had value, yelling and causing a rift over an honest mistake might be too much. Also, the author decided not to make the sister pay, which is a good step. So, the author is partly at fault for overreacting, even if the item was valuable. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) based on the context provided.\n"
