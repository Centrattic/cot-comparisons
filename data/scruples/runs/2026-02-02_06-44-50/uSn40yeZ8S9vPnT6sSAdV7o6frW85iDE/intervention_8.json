My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The situation is that the sister ate them, and the author lost the profit. The author ended up apologizing and driving to her college to make things right.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author was selling something for profit, which is legitimate. The sister ate the item without knowing its value, probably because it's unusual for cough drops to be worth that much. The author got angry, which led to a rift. The key points here are intent and proportionality. The sister didn't know the drops were for sale; she just liked the taste. The author's reaction of yelling and causing the sister to leave might be excessive for an honest mistake. However, the author did take responsibility later, which shows they recognized their actions were too harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, losing $35 profit could be a hassle, but is that worth yelling at a family member? The sister didn't have bad intentions. The author's initial reaction might have been over the top, but they made amends by apologizing and not making the sister pay. The buyer's review was a consequence, but the author handled that as best as they could.\n\nConsidering all this, the main issue is the author's reaction being disproportionate to the sister's mistake. The sister didn't act with malice. So even though the author corrected their behavior, the initial yelling was wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
