My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of this Reddit-style post is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The situation is that the author sold some cough drops on eBay, made a profit, but then couldn't find them. They discovered the sister ate them and confronted her, yelling, leading to the sister going back to college and not talking since. The author later apologized and didn't make them pay because it was an honest mistake.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the cough drops were being sold as part of a business, and the sister ate them without realizing their value. The author got angry and yelled, which caused a rift in their relationship. The author is now feeling guilty and taking steps to fix it by apologizing and contacting the buyer.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were justified. Yelling at a family member over a financial loss can be seen as overreacting. The profit was $35, which is not a huge amount. The sister might not have known they were for sale, especially if she saw them as regular cough drops. The author's business is a personal endeavor, but family dynamics often require more sensitivity. \n\nThe fact that the author is now taking responsibility by driving to the sister's college to apologize and set ground rules shows some maturity. However, the initial reaction of yelling, especially leading to the sister leaving and the relationship breaking down, suggests that the author's response was excessive. The sister made a mistake, but the author's emotional outburst might have been the bigger issue. \n\nIn such cases, while the sister did take something that was meant for sale, the author's handling of the situation is a significant factor. The loss of a relationship over $35 is disproportionate. So, the author is probably in the wrong for overreacting, even if the sister was at fault for eating the drops. The question is whether the author's anger was justified. Given the financial context and the fact that the sister didn't know, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
