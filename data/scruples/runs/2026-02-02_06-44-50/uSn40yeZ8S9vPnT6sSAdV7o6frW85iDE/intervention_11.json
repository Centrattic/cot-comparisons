My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The situation involves the sister eating the cough drops that the author was selling, leading to a breakdown in their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was selling the cough drops on eBay and made a profit. The sister ate them without knowing their value. The author then yelled at her, leading to the sister leaving for college and not talking since. The author later apologized and went to visit her, but the sister felt the reaction was disproportionate.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the sister's action was an honest mistake. She didn't know the cough drops were valuable. The author's reaction was yelling and being harsh, which might be seen as overreacting. While the cough drops were worth money to the author, the sister had no way of knowing that. The value might be subjective, especially if the brand or logo wasn't obvious. The author's anger over a family member's innocent mistake could be considered excessive. Additionally, the author took responsibility by apologizing and making amends, but the initial reaction still caused a rift.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had the right to be upset about losing the item they were selling. However, the way they handled it\u2014yelling\u2014might have been the main issue here. The sister's perspective is important too; she might not have realized the impact of her actions. The author's apology and willingness to repair the relationship show some accountability, but the initial response still seems to be the core problem.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's actions, while understandable in being upset, were disproportionate given the sister's lack of intent. The key here is intent: the sister didn't mean to cause harm, so the author's reaction was more severe than necessary. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
