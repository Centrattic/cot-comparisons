My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The situation is that they were selling them on eBay and their sister ate them. The author feels bad and ended up apologizing, but the sister stopped talking to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the value of the item. $45 isn't huge, but maybe for someone who's using eBay to make a living or extra cash, it could be significant. The author was planning to deliver them, so the sister eating them probably caused a problem with a customer. That could lead to a bad review or losing money.\n\nThen there's the reaction. Yelling, which is a strong response. Even if the item is valuable, the sister might not have known the item's worth. If the author didn't clearly communicate the importance of the cough drops, maybe the sister had no idea. So the author's anger might be justified if the sister knew, but if she didn't, then the yelling was overreacting.\n\nThe sister went back to college and didn't talk since. The author tried to fix it by apologizing, which is good. The sister's perspective was that it was just cough drops, so maybe the author's reaction was too harsh. The key here is communication. Did the author explain the significance of the cough drops beforehand? If not, the sister couldn't be expected to know they were for sale. So the author might be at fault for not setting boundaries.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author ended up driving to the sister's college to apologize shows they realized their mistake. The sister might have felt attacked, especially if the author didn't explain the context. The author's initial reaction was yelling, which can damage relationships. So while the sister made a mistake, the author's response was probably too strong, making them at least partially wrong.\n\nAnother angle: the sister ate something that wasn't hers. That's not great, but maybe she didn't realize. The author should have stored it where the sister couldn't reach it. Maybe the author is also responsible for keeping items secure if they're for sale. So both sides have some responsibility, but the author's reaction was the immediate issue. Yelling led to the sister cutting off contact, so the author's actions caused the problem in the relationship.\n"
