My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author sells stuff on eBay, and these cough drops were part of that. The sister ate them, not knowing their value. The author got angry, yelled, and the sister left. The author later apologized and didn't make the sister pay. \n\nHmm, the key points here are about the value of the item and the reaction. The author made $35 profit, which is a significant amount for cough drops. But the sister didn't know they were valuable. The author's reaction was yelling, which might be excessive. However, the author did apologize and make an effort to fix things. \n\nIs yelling justified? Maybe not, especially since the sister didn't intend to take them. The author's frustration is understandable, but yelling might have been an overreaction. Also, the sister's perspective is important\u2014she didn't know the value, so the author's anger could seem unreasonable. \n\nThe author admitted they felt it wasn't worth it and took responsibility. So while the sister's mistake was innocent, the author's reaction was harsh. The fact that the author went to apologize shows they realize their mistake. \n\nSo overall, the author is probably in the wrong because they overreacted, even if the sister was at fault for eating them without knowing. The value was high, but the sister's intent wasn't malicious. The author's emotional response was excessive compared to the situation. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
