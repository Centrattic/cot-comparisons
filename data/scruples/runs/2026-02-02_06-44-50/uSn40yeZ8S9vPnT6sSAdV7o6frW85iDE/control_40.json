My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. \n\nFirst, the context: The author sells items on eBay, and the cough drops were part of a sale. They made $35 profit. The sister ate them, not knowing their value. The author got angry, yelled, and the sister left, and they haven't talked since.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author was selling these cough drops, which were worth $45. The sister didn't realize their value and ate them. The author got upset because they lost the profit from the sale. The sister's action was an honest mistake, but the author's reaction was yelling and confrontation. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author has a right to be upset about losing money from an item they were selling. The cough drops were part of their business, so their value is significant in that context. The sister's action, while unintentional, caused a loss of income, which the author might find frustrating.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister didn't know the cough drops were valuable. The author's response was yelling, which might have been excessive given the circumstances. The emotional reaction led to a breakdown in their relationship, which the author now regrets. The author later took steps to apologize and resolve the situation, which shows they recognized the mistake in their approach.\n\nThe user edited their post to mention driving to the sister's college to apologize and set boundaries. They also contacted the buyer and got a 3-star review. The sister's perspective was that the author was being overly harsh about cough drops, which she didn't know were valuable. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's mistake was in the way they handled the situation, not the fact that they were upset. Yelling and causing emotional harm over a $35 profit might be seen as disproportionate, especially since the sister's mistake was innocent. The author later took corrective action, which mitigates some of the blame, but the initial reaction was inappropriate. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because their reaction was excessive given that the sister didn't intend harm. However, some might argue B (not in the wrong) because the author had a legitimate reason to be upset about losing business income. But the key factor is the sister's lack of intent and the author's emotional response leading to a strained relationship. The resolution where the author apologized and the sister's perspective support that the author's reaction was indeed wrong.\n"
