My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about them yelling at their sister for eating cough drops they sold on eBay for $45, which led to the sister going back to college and not talking since.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author sold the cough drops for $45, but their sister ate them. The author was upset, yelled, and felt bad afterward. They later tried to make amends by visiting the sister and apologizing, and also contacted the buyer who gave a 3-star review.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The sister ate the cough drops without knowing their value. The author was angry because they had made $35 profit, which they considered significant. But yelling at the sister over an honest mistake might be seen as excessive. The sister's perspective is that it was just cough drops, not understanding their monetary value. The author's reaction seems disproportional to the sister's mistake. However, the author did take steps to fix the situation by apologizing and setting boundaries, which shows they recognized their error.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the sister made a mistake but didn't have malicious intent. The author's yelling led to a breakdown in their relationship. While the author has a right to be upset about losing the money, the way they reacted might be considered wrong because they overreacted. The fact that they later apologized and tried to mend things suggests they admitted fault.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's initial reaction was wrong, but their subsequent actions showed they took responsibility. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not if they corrected it. The sister's mistake was innocent, and the author's anger was disproportionate. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their reaction was excessive given the circumstances and the sister's lack of intent to harm.\n"
