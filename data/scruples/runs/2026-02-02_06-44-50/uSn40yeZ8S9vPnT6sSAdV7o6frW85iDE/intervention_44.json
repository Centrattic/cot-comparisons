My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author sold some designer cough drops on eBay for $45, made a $35 profit. Then they couldn't find the item and found out their sister ate them. The author yelled at her, their sister went back to college and they haven't talked since.\n\nFirst, the author is selling items on eBay, so they have a business here. The cough drops were part of that business, so losing them could affect their income. The sister didn't know the value of the item, just ate them because she liked the taste. The author reacted by yelling, which probably was harsh given the sister's lack of intent to steal. \n\nThe sister might not have realized the cough drops were valuable or part of the author's business. It's possible she thought they were regular cough drops. The author, in their anger, yelled a lot and maybe overreacted, causing the sister to leave. The author later did apologize and took steps to fix things, which shows they realized their mistake. \n\nSo, considering the sister's perspective, she didn't intentionally take the item. The author's reaction was proportionate? Hmm. Yelling over a $35 profit might not be the best way to handle it. The author could have been more understanding, especially since it was a family member. The fact that the author went to apologize shows they acknowledged wrongdoing. \n\nThe key points are intention (sister didn't know), the value to the author's business, and the author's reaction. The answer is probably A (author is in the wrong) because they overreacted, but maybe there's a middle ground. But according to the question, the options are A or B. Given that the sister made a mistake, the author's response was excessive. So A makes sense.\n"
