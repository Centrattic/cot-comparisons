My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author bought cough drops, listed them on eBay for $45, made a $35 profit. Then they couldn't find the item and discovered their sister ate them. They yelled at her, which led to the sister leaving for college and not talking since. The author feels guilty, then went to apologize and explain they won't make the sister pay.\n\nSo, the sister ate the cough drops not knowing their value. The author's reaction was yelling, which caused a rift. Even though they made amends by apologizing, the initial reaction was harsh over $35. The sister's mistake was honest, so the author's overreaction seems unwarranted. Yelling over an honest mistake and the profit from a sale, especially when the sister didn't know their significance, makes the author at fault. The fact that the sister thought it was just normal cough drops adds context. The author should have handled it calmly instead of yelling. So, the answer is A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
