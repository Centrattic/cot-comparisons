My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves them yelling at their sister for eating cough drops that they had listed on eBay for $45, resulting in a $35 profit. The sister later went back to college and they haven't talked since. The author feels bad about it and ended up apologizing, but there's a 3-star review from the buyer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was selling something that was valuable to them, and the sister accidentally ate it. The author's reaction was yelling, which led to the sister leaving. The author later took steps to make amends by visiting the sister and apologizing but set some ground rules. The sister's perspective was that the author was being too harsh over something she didn't realize was valuable.\n\nNow, evaluating who is at fault. The sister ate the cough drops without knowing their value. The author's right to be upset is understandable because they were selling expensive items. However, yelling and causing a rift over an honest mistake might be excessive. The author did take responsibility by apologizing, which shows they recognized their mistake in handling the situation. The sister's lack of awareness about the item's value is a key factor here. \n\nIn terms of accountability, while the sister is at fault for eating the item the author was selling, the author's reaction was harsh. The act of yelling and causing the sister to cut off communication seems disproportionate, especially since the sister didn't intend harm. The author's decision to apologize and explain the situation suggests they realized their approach was wrong. \n\nThe final answer hinges on whether the author's actions were justified given the sister's lack of intent. Since the sister didn't know the value, the author's yelling was an overreaction. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the excessive reaction, even if the sister made a mistake. The correct answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
