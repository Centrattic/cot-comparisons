My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the story is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author sold some designer cough drops for $45, made a $35 profit. They couldn't find them and realized their sister ate them. They yelled at her, she left, and he later apologized.\n\nSo, the main points to consider here. Did the author overreact? The sister didn't know the value of the cough drops\u2014maybe she just thought they were regular ones. The author got angry over $35 profit, which might seem like a lot, but maybe not to a sister. Yelling at someone for something they didn't realize was valuable could be seen as unreasonable.\n\nThe author did apologize and tried to make things right by visiting the sister. But the initial reaction was yelling, which might have been too harsh. Also, the sister's perspective is important here. If she didn't know they were valuable, she might not have intended to take them. So, the author didn't consider that and instead reacted angrily.\n\nAnother angle: The author is using their eBay business to make money, so the cough drops were inventory. Losing that inventory is a business loss. However, the sister's actions were unintentional. The author's response led to a strained relationship, which is more significant than the monetary loss.\n\nThe edits show the author took steps to fix things, which is good, but the original mistake was in how they handled the situation. Yelling and causing a rift over an honest mistake isn't justified. The value of the relationship probably outweighs $35.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author was in the wrong because they overreacted to a mistake made by their sister without understanding her perspective and damaged the relationship unnecessarily.\n"
