My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about yelling at a sister for eating 45-dollar cough drops.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author sold the cough drops on eBay for 45$, which means they had a specific value attached to them. The sister ate them without knowing their value, probably because she didn't see the logo or recognize them as part of the eBay item. \n\nThe author's reaction was yelling, which might have been excessive, especially since it led to the sister leaving and not talking since. The author later apologized, which shows they realized their actions were too harsh. The sister's mistake was honest, and the author even decided not to make her pay for them. \n\nHowever, the initial reaction of yelling over an honest mistake could be seen as overreacting. The value of the item was high due to being an eBay sale, but to the sister, they were just cough drops. The author might have overestimated the sister's responsibility in this situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister didn't ask and took the item without realizing its significance to the author. But since it's a family situation, the expectation might be different. The key points here are the intention of the sister and the proportionality of the author's response. \n\nGiven that the author later apologized and took responsibility, but the initial reaction was harsh, I think the author is in the wrong because they overreacted to an honest mistake made by family. So the answer would be A.\n"
