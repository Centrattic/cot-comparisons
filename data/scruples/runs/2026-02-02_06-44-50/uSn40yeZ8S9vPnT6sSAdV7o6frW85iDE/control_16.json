My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a sibling conflict over cough drops sold on eBay.\n\nFirst, the author bought and sold designer items on eBay. They listed Supreme cough drops, which ended up selling for $45. But they lost the item before the sale because their sister ate them. The author yelled at their sister, leading to her leaving. Now they're feeling guilty and have apologized.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the sister ate the cough drops, but did she know they were valuable? The author mentions she didn't know the value or the logo. The author was selling them, so maybe they should have stored them more securely. The sister's mistake was honest, so the author's reaction\u2014yelling and causing a rift\u2014might be excessive. The author took steps to fix it by apologizing and not making the sister pay, which shows they realized their mistake. The initial reaction was harsh, but the resolution is positive. So, the author was in the wrong for overreacting, even though the sister did something wrong. The answer is A.\n"
