My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about their sister eating $45 cough drops that the author was selling on eBay. The author ended up yelling at their sister, and now the sister hasn't talked to them since.\n\nFirst, the author made a profit of $35 from selling these cough drops. That's not a huge amount, but it's their money. The sister ate them without knowing their value, probably because they were in the author's closet. The author was upset about losing the money and the item, which led to yelling. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the sister made an honest mistake. She didn't know the cough drops were valuable, so she ate them. The author could have been more open about where the items were stored, maybe labeled them, so their sister wouldn't accidentally consume them. But the sister did do something wrong by taking the items without permission. \n\nThe author's reaction was yelling, which might have been excessive given that the sister didn't intend to steal. The author later apologized and went to their college, which shows they realized the yelling was too harsh. The sister's reaction of leaving might have been a result of feeling attacked, which the author now acknowledges. \n\nSo, the author's mistake was handling the situation with anger instead of calmly explaining the value of the items and maybe setting boundaries. The sister's mistake was eating the cough drops, but it was an honest error. The author was right to be upset about losing the item but wrong in how they expressed that anger, leading to a breakdown in communication. \n\nSince the author took steps to fix the situation by apologizing and making amends, it shows they understand their part in the conflict. Therefore, the author is partly at fault for overreacting, but not entirely wrong since the sister did make a mistake. However, given the context, the author's approach was inappropriate, so they are in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
