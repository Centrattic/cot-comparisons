My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over eating $45 cough drops. \n\nFirst, the context: The author sells items on eBay, and these cough drops were part of that. The sister ate them without knowing their value, leading the author to yell. The sister then left for college and they haven't talked since. The author later apologized and went to visit her, which seems like a positive step.\n\nSo, considering the sister's perspective: She ate the cough drops thinking they were just regular ones. The author had not informed her about their special status. The sister made an honest mistake. Yelling at her for that might be seen as overreacting, especially since the items were not something she would know to avoid. \n\nThe author's reaction caused a rift, as the sister left and didn't talk back. The author realized later that the value of the items wasn't something the sister could know, leading them to apologize. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be at fault for not clearly labeling or keeping the items in a way that the sister wouldn't accidentally consume them. Also, yelling over a mistake, even if the item was valuable, could be seen as disproportionate. The fact that the author later apologized and tried to make amends shows they recognized their mistake. \n\nThe buyer's 3-star review was a consequence of the author's situation, but that's separate from the sister's issue. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's initial reaction was harsh, not considering the sister's lack of knowledge about the item's value. The sister's action was a mistake, not malicious. Therefore, the author was in the wrong for overreacting.\n"
