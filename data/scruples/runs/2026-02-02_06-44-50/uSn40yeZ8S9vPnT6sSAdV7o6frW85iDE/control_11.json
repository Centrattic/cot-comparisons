My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about yelling at their sister for eating $45 cough drops they were selling on eBay. The sister went back to college and they haven't talked since. The author later drove to her college to apologize and explain the situation, and the sister felt it was overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the value of the item. $45 for cough drops might seem high, but if they were selling them on eBay and made a $35 profit, then it's their money and they might feel it's important. However, the sister didn't know the value and just ate them because she liked the taste. That's an honest mistake. \n\nThe author yelled at her, which could be seen as overreacting. Even though the item had value to them, the sister wasn't trying to steal. The author's reaction caused a rift in their relationship, leading the sister to leave and not talk for a month. The author later apologized and tried to make things right by not making the sister pay, which is good. \n\nBut the initial reaction of yelling might still be considered wrong because they overreacted to an honest mistake. The emotional response was harsh, leading to a broken communication. The author realized their mistake and took steps to fix it, which is positive, but the question is whether they were in the wrong initially. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, intent and proportionality matter. The sister didn't intend to cause harm, and the author's response was extreme given the situation. Even if the item was valuable, the way they handled it could have been better. So, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
