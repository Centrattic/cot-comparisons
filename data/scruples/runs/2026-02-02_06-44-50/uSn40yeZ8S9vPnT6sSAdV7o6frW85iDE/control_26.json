My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author yelling at their sister for eating cough drops that they had intended to sell for $45. The sister went back to college and hasn't talked to them since. The author later went to apologize and resolved the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made a profit of $35 from selling the cough drops, but the sister ate them without knowing their value. The author got angry and yelled, leading to a strained relationship. The sister's perspective was that it was just cough drops, and she didn't know their worth. The author later apologized and didn't make her pay, which shows some resolution.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is the reaction. Yelling over an accidental mistake, even if the item had value, could be seen as excessive. The sister didn't know they were for sale and consumed them. The author's profit was $35, which might not justify the emotional damage caused. The author realized their mistake and took steps to fix it by apologizing, which is a positive action. However, the initial reaction of yelling was harsh. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should have communicated better about the items' purpose. If the sister wasn't aware they were for sale, the author might be partially responsible for not securing them properly. The sister made a mistake, but the author's response was disproportionate. So, the author is partially at fault for the reaction and not managing their belongings in a way that prevents such misunderstandings. However, the author did take responsibility later. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) terms, the answer often depends on the balance between both parties. Here, the sister made an honest mistake, and the author overreacted. The fact that the author went to apologize and resolved the situation might mitigate some blame. But the initial yelling was wrong. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their reaction was excessive given the sister's lack of intent and the relatively low financial value compared to the emotional impact.\n"
