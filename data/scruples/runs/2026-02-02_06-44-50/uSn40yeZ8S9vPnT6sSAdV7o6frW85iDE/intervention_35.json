My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves them yelling at their sister for eating cough drops they were selling on eBay, which ended up being worth $45. The sister went back to college and they haven't talked since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author bought the cough drops intending to sell them, and the sister ate them without knowing their value. The author lost money because the item wasn't available to sell anymore. On the other hand, the sister didn't know they were for sale and just ate them because she liked the taste.\n\nThe author yelled at the sister, which caused a rift in their relationship. The key here is whether the reaction was proportionate to the situation. While the author did lose money, yelling at the sister and causing her to leave might be an overreaction. The fact that the sister didn't know the value of the cough drops (maybe she didn't see the Supreme logo) could mean it was an honest mistake. The author later apologized and went to visit her, which shows some accountability, but the initial reaction might still be considered wrong.\n\nAlso, the author was selling them on auction, so the item's value wasn't obvious to someone else in the house. The sister's action was innocent, and the author's response was harsh. So, even though the author had a valid reason to be upset, the way they handled it was probably inconsiderate of the sister's perspective. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting.\n"
