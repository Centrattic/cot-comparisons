My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a sister eating cough drops that the author was selling for $45, leading to an argument and a fallout.\n\nFirst, the author made a profit of $35 from the sale. The sister ate the item without knowing its value or that it was for sale. The author yelled at her, which caused the sister to leave and not talk to them since. The author later apologized but is upset about the 3-star review from the buyer.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? The sister made an honest mistake, not knowing the cough drops were for sale or their value. The author, while justified in being upset about losing money, overreacted by yelling. The sister's actions were unintentional, so the author's reaction might have been too harsh. The key points are intent and reaction. The sister didn't mean to cause harm, but the author's yelling escalated the situation unnecessarily. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting, even if the sister's mistake was genuine.\n"
