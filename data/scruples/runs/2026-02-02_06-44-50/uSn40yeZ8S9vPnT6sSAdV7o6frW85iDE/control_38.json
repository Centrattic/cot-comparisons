My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The situation is that the author sells stuff on eBay, and these cough drops were part of that. The sister ate them without knowing their value, leading to the author losing profit. The author yelled, sister left, and now they're feeling bad and apologized later.\n\nFirst, the author's actions. They were upset about losing money, which is understandable. But yelling at a sister over something that was an honest mistake might be excessive. The sister didn't know the drops were valuable; she just liked the taste. The author's initial reaction was anger, which caused a rift. The fact that the author later took steps to reconcile by visiting the sister and apologizing shows they realized their mistake. However, the initial reaction was harsh. The sister's perspective is important here\u2014she thought it was just regular cough drops. The author might have failed to communicate the value properly. So, while the author had a reason to be upset, the way they handled it was wrong. They should have been more understanding and explained the situation calmly. The answer is A.\n"
