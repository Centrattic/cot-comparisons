My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister eating cough drops that the author was selling for $45, leading to an argument and the sister leaving. The author later apologized and drove to her college, so there's some resolution.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The sister ate the cough drops, which the author had intended to sell. The author made a profit of $35 from that item. The sister's reasoning was that she liked the taste. The author yelled at her, which caused the sister to leave, and they haven't talked since. The author feels bad and tried to fix things by apologizing and not making the sister pay, but the sister was upset about being yelled at over an item she didn't realize was valuable.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? The sister took something that wasn't hers, even if she didn't know the value. But the author's reaction was yelling, which escalated things. They had a $35 item, which is a bit surprising for cough drops, but maybe it's a limited edition or branded item. However, the sister had no way of knowing the value, especially if the logo wasn't visible. The author stored the item in their closet, which might not be the most secure place if they're selling items. The sister didn't have intent to steal; it was an honest mistake. The author's reaction of yelling seems disproportionate given the circumstances, especially since the sister didn't know the value. The author did take responsibility later, which is good, but the initial reaction was harsh. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have some fault. The sister took an item that was meant to be sold, but the author stored it where a sibling might take it. The author's yelling overreacted to an honest mistake. The fact that the sister left and they lost communication for a month shows the impact of the author's actions. The author later apologized, which suggests they realized their mistake. So, while both have some responsibility, the author's reaction was more harmful. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because their response was disproportionate and caused harm to the relationship over an honest mistake.\n"
