My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at their sister for eating cough drops they were selling on eBay. The sister didn't know they were valuable, and the author lost money because the buyer gave a 3-star review.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was selling the cough drops for $45, made a $35 profit. The sister ate them, not knowing their value. The author yelled and this caused the sister to leave and not talk since. The author later apologized and went to her college, which is a good step.\n\nFrom the sister's perspective, cough drops are usually cheap, so she probably had no idea they were worth that much. The author didn't inform her about the value, which is a problem. The author's reaction was excessive yelling, which is understandable in anger but not the best approach. The sister leaving might have been due to feeling attacked, even if it was a mistake.\n\nThe author did take steps to make amends by apologizing and setting boundaries. That shows they realized their mistake. But the initial reaction was over the top. The sister didn't intend to steal or be malicious, just an honest mistake. The value of the item vs. the relationship's importance is a factor here. The author could have handled it without yelling.\n\nSo, the main issue is the author's response. The sister's action was a mistake, and yelling led to a bigger problem. The author is in the wrong for overreacting. Answer A.\n"
