My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops, leading to a strained relationship.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author sold cough drops for $45 on eBay, made a $35 profit. The sister ate them without knowing their value. The author confronted her, yelled, and now the sister hasn't spoken to them since. The author later apologized and went to see the sister, but there's still a 3-star review from the buyer.\n\nSo, the main points are: Did the author overreact? Was yelling appropriate? The sister didn't know the value, so it was an honest mistake. The author's anger seems disproportionate to the situation. Even though the cough drops were valuable in the context of their eBay business, the sister wasn't aware of that. The author's reaction led to a significant fallout. The author later took steps to fix things by apologizing and not making the sister pay, but the initial reaction was harsh. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key is whether the author's response was justified. Since the sister didn't intentionally do it and it was an honest mistake, yelling and causing a rift over $35 profit might be considered overreacting. The author realized this later, hence the apology. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because their reaction was excessive given the circumstances.\n"
