My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The situation involves the author selling designer cough drops on eBay and their sister eating them, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the value of the item. The author made a $35 profit, but the sister probably didn't know they were valuable. She ate them thinking they were regular cough drops. That seems like an honest mistake. The author then yelled at her, which led to the sister leaving and not talking since. \n\nThe emotional impact is significant here. The author is upset about losing money, but the sister might have felt attacked for a mistake. The author's reaction was over $35, which is a lot of money, but is it worth the emotional damage? The sister's perspective is important too. If she didn't know their value, it was an accident. \n\nThe author later went to apologize, which shows they realized there was a problem. But the initial reaction of yelling seems excessive. The key points are intent and proportionality. The sister didn't intentionally steal; she made a mistake. The author's response was harsh compared to the situation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong for overreacting. The correct answer is A.\n"
