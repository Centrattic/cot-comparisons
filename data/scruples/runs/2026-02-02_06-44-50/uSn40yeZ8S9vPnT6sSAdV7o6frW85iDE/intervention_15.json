My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a person who sells items on eBay. They had an auction for Supreme cough drops that sold for $45, giving them a $35 profit. Then they couldn't find the cough drops and found out their sister ate them. The author yelled at her, leading to her going back to college and not talking to them since. The author feels bad and later apologized but is still dealing with the consequences, like a 3-star review from the buyer.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the value of the cough drops and the reaction. The cough drops were part of a business transaction, so they had a specific value. The sister ate them without knowing, which the author found upsetting. The author's reaction was yelling, which escalated the situation. The sister's perspective was that it was just cough drops, not realizing their monetary value.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the sister didn't know the value, so maybe she didn't intend to steal or harm their business. The author's reaction was yelling, which might have been disproportionate. However, the cough drops had a significant value in the author's business context. The sister's mistake was in not checking the items and consuming them. \n\nThe author did apologize and tried to make amends, which shows they realized their error in yelling. The sister's reaction of leaving might have been extreme too. But the main issue is whether the author overreacted. Yelling at a family member over a $35 item could be seen as excessive, especially when the sister didn't have malicious intent. The author's business loss is real, but the emotional impact on their relationship might be worse. \n\nSo considering all that, the author's mistake was in how they handled the situation, not necessarily in being upset about losing the item. The yelling was likely the main issue here. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for overreacting.\n"
