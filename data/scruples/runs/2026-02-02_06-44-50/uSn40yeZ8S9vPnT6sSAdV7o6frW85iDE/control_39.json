My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author yelling at their sister for eating $45 cough drops they were selling on eBay. The sister went back to college and didn't talk to them since, but the author later apologized and went to visit her.\n\nFirst, the cough drops were part of their eBay business. They sold them for $45, making a $35 profit. The sister ate them thinking maybe they were just regular cough drops, not knowing their value or that they were for sale. The author got angry, yelled, and the sister left. The author then realized it wasn't worth it and took steps to make amends.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the sister didn't know the value. The author was upset about losing money, but reacting with yelling seems excessive. The fact that they later apologized and tried to fix things might show they recognize their mistake. The sister's action was an honest mistake, so the author's reaction of yelling could be seen as overreacting. On the other hand, the author had a right to be upset about losing money from their business. But the emotional response causing a family rift might make them at fault. The key points are the sister's ignorance of the value and the author's overreaction. The author admitted it wasn't worth it and made amends, which suggests they were in the wrong initially. So the answer is A.\n"
