My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a sister eating cough drops that the author was selling on eBay for $45, making a $35 profit. The author got really upset and yelled at their sister, leading to the sister going back to college and them not talking since. The author later apologized and drove to her college.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author had a specific item they were selling, which they had put up for auction. The sister ate the item without knowing its value. The author's anger over $35 profit might seem excessive, but the item was part of their business. On the other hand, the sister didn't realize the item's worth and used it, which was probably an honest mistake.\n\nThe author yelled at the sister, which is a strong reaction. Yelling can be seen as an overreaction, especially when the sister was just making a mistake. The author's actions led to the sister leaving, which might indicate that the yelling was hurtful. However, the author did take responsibility by apologizing and driving to the sister's college, showing they regretted their reaction.\n\nThe sister's perspective is that the author was being mean over cough drops. She might not have known they were valuable or part of a business. The author's mistake was not communicating the value of the item to the sister. Maybe they should have kept it more secure or informed the sister about its importance. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister had access to the item and chose to eat it, regardless of its purpose. The author might feel that their property was respected, but the sister didn't realize. The key points are whether the author's reaction was justified and if they handled the situation appropriately.\n\nThe author did apologize and made amends, which is positive. But the initial reaction of yelling was harsh. The value of the item is significant to the author but might seem trivial to the sister. The author's business relying on such items makes them valuable, but the sister's mistake was innocent.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be at fault for overreacting, even though their intent wasn't malicious. The sister's mistake was honest, and the author should have handled it calmly to explain the situation without yelling. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because the reaction was excessive given the sister's lack of intent. However, there's nuance because the item had value to the author's business. But overall, the yelling and the impact on their relationship suggest the author is more at fault.\n"
