My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the author sells items on eBay and had an auction for Supreme cough drops. They sold for $45, making a $35 profit. They couldn't find the item until they saw their sister had eaten them. Then they yelled at her, leading to the sister leaving and not talking since. The author later apologized and drove to her college, but got a 3-star review from the buyer.\n\nNow, considering the elements here. The sister ate the cough drops, thinking they were just regular ones. The author was unaware she had eaten them until after the auction ended. The key points are intent and proportionality. \n\nWas the sister's action intentional? She said she ate them because she liked the taste. But she didn't know their value or that they were for sale. So, it's an honest mistake, not theft. The author's reaction was yelling, which might have been excessive given that it was a mistake. The author made $35 profit, but the sister had no way of knowing the item's value. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author is now trying to make amends by apologizing is a positive step. The sister's reaction of leaving might be due to being shocked by the author's anger. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting. The sister didn't take them maliciously. The author's emotional response led to a breakdown in their relationship. The fact that the author is seeking advice and taking steps to fix it shows they realize their mistake. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had a legitimate reason to be upset about losing a valuable item. But the way they handled it\u2014yelling\u2014was harsh. The sister didn't intend to cause harm, so the author's anger was disproportionate. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong for overreacting, even though there's some context. The sister made a mistake, but the author's response was too harsh, leading to the rift. The fact that the author is trying to make up for it now also supports that they acknowledge their fault.\n"
