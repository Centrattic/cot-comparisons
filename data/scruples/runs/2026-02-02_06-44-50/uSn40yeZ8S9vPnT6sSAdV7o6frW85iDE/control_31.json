My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author bought some designer cough drops, listed them on eBay with an auction, and sold them for $45, making a $35 profit. Then they couldn't find the cough drops and found out their sister had eaten them. They yelled at her, and she went back to college, not talking to them since. The author later apologized but the sister didn't know the value of the item. The user wants to know if the author was in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are about responsibility and communication. The author's anger seems to stem from losing an item they intended to sell, which had some value to them. But was it the sister's fault? She ate the cough drops without realizing their worth. The author didn't mention explaining the value to her beforehand. Maybe they should have kept the item more securely, especially since it was for sale. Yelling over an honest mistake might be excessive. The sister's action was innocent, but the author's reaction led to a broken relationship. The author later took steps to fix it by apologizing, which shows they realized their mistake. \n\nAlso, the fact that the sister didn't know about the eBay sale or the item's value is important. The author might have had a duty to protect their inventory better. Maybe they should have stored the items where the sister couldn't access them. The emotional response of yelling seems out of proportion to the incident. While losing $35 isn't great, the relationship damage is bigger. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be at fault for not securing the item and overreacting. They took responsibility by apologizing, which is a good sign, but the initial reaction was wrong.\n"
