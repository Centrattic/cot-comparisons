My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is they sold some cough drops on eBay for $45, made a $35 profit, then their sister ate them. The author got really angry, yelled at her, and now the sister hasn't talked to them since. The user is asking if they're the a**hole.\n\nFirst, the cough drops were part of their business. That's important because it's not just personal; it was an item they were selling to make money. So losing that item could affect their income. But the sister didn't know they were valuable. She just ate them because she liked the taste. The author was selling them on auction, maybe they were a special edition or something, given the Supreme logo? Maybe the sister didn't notice the brand, so she didn't know they were collectible or meant to be sold.\n\nThe author got angry and yelled. That's where the conflict started. Yelling is a strong reaction, especially when it's a family member. Even if the item is valuable to the author, the sister's action was an accident. The author could have been more understanding, considered that the sister didn't realize their importance. The fact that the author is now feeling bad and going to apologize shows they recognize that their reaction was excessive.\n\nThe sister went back to college and didn't talk to the author after that. The author admits it's not worth $35, but they still lost the item and a five-star review. However, the sister's mistake was honest. The author could have explained the situation better instead of yelling. The sister's perspective is that it's just cough drops, so the author's overreaction might have been the main issue here.\n\nIn the end, the author apologized, which is a good step. But the initial reaction was harsh. Since the sister didn't know the value, the author should have been more communicative about the items' importance. So, while the sister made a mistake, the author's response was inappropriate, making them at least partly at fault.\n"
