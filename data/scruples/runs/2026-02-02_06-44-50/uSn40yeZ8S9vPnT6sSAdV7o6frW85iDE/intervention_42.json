My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over some expensive cough drops. The situation is that the author sold the cough drops on eBay for $45, made a $35 profit, but the sister ate them. The author confronted her and yelled, leading to the sister going back to college and not talking to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's frustration is understandable because they had a specific item they were selling, which the sister unknowingly consumed. The sister didn't realize the value of the cough drops, maybe because they were branded (like Supreme, which is a luxury brand known for high prices). But the sister's action was an honest mistake. She ate them because she liked the taste, not out of malice.\n\nNow, the author yelled at her, which caused the sister to leave and not communicate. The author later apologized and went to visit her, which shows some remorse. The sister's perspective is that the author overreacted, even if the item was valuable. The author's reaction seems disproportionate given that the sister didn't know the item was being sold. The emotional impact on the sister is significant, leading to her leaving. \n\nThe author could have handled the situation differently. Instead of yelling, they might have explained the situation and asked her to return the cough drops or pay for them. However, the sister's mistake was unintentional. The author's anger over $35 profit leading to a strained relationship seems like the bigger issue. The sister's action, while a mistake, wasn't malicious. The author's response, however, caused more harm. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the sister's mistake is understandable, but the author's reaction was harsh. The value of the item is high, but the sister's intent was innocent. The author's yelling and the resulting emotional fallout suggest that they overreacted. So, the author is in the wrong because their reaction was excessive given the circumstances. The sister didn't intentionally take the item, and the author's response led to a significant conflict where a more measured approach could have resolved the issue without damaging their relationship.\n"
