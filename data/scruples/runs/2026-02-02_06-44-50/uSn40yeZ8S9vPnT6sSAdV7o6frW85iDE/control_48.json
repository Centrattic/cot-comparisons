My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The situation involves the sister eating the cough drops that the author had put up for sale on eBay, leading to a $35 profit. The author confronted her, yelled, and the sister went back to college without talking to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's intention was to sell the cough drops, which they likely valued not just for the monetary gain but also because it was part of their eBay business. Losing the item before the sale would disrupt their plans. The sister, on the other hand, might not have realized the item's value or that it was meant to be sold. She ate them because she liked the taste, which seems like an innocent mistake.\n\nThe author's reaction was yelling, which can be seen as an overreaction, especially since the sister didn't intentionally take the item. The fact that the author made a profit of $35 might not justify the emotional impact on the sister. The sister's response of leaving for college suggests that the yelling had a significant negative effect on her. The author later apologized and drove to her college, showing remorse, which is a positive step.\n\nHowever, the key point here is whether the author was in the wrong. Yelling at someone for an honest mistake, even if the item had value, could be considered excessive. The sister didn't know the item was for sale, so the author should have considered that when confronting her. The author's initial reaction led to a breakdown in their relationship, which might have been avoided with a calmer approach.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention was to protect their property, the method of confrontation was inappropriate. The sister's mistake was honest, and the author's overreaction caused more harm than necessary. Therefore, the author is at least partially at fault for the way they handled the situation.\n"
