My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. \n\nFirst, the context: the author sells designer items on eBay and made $35 profit from an auction of Supreme cough drops. The sister ate them, then the author yelled, leading to a fallout. The sister went back to college and they haven't talked since. The author later apologized and drove to her college.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's reaction was yelling, which might be seen as over the top. The sister, from her perspective, ate the cough drops thinking they were normal ones. The author made money from selling them, but the sister didn't know their value. The sister's action was an honest mistake. The author apologized and tried to make amends by not making her pay. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, yelling at someone over a mistake, especially a family member, can be seen as excessive. The author's reaction led to a significant strain in their relationship. Even though the sister made a mistake, the author's response was harsh. However, the author took steps to fix the situation by apologizing. \n\nBut the question is whether they were in the wrong. The sister didn't intend to take the item, so the author's anger might be justified in terms of financial loss, but the way they handled it\u2014yelling and causing a rift\u2014might be the issue. The fact that the author later apologized shows they realized their mistake. \n\nIn AITA situations, people often get called out for overreacting. The value here was $45, which isn't that high, especially for family. The author's emotional response and the sister's perspective matter. So even though the sister was at fault for eating them, the author's reaction was the main problem. Therefore, the answer is more likely A (the author is in the wrong), but maybe the community sees it as a mutual misunderstanding. However, the sister's action was innocent, and the author's response was too harsh. So A is probably the right choice here.\n"
