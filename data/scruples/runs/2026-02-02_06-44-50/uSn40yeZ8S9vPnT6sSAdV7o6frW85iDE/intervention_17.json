My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. So, the author bought cough drops, put them up for auction on eBay and made a profit, then couldn't find them until they saw the sister ate them. The author yelled at the sister, leading to her leaving and not talking since. The user says they think the author is wrong but wants to know more.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the cough drops were part of a business transaction. The author made a profit, so there's a monetary loss. The sister ate them thinking they were just regular cough drops. The author's reaction was yelling, which caused a rift. \n\nNow, the question is about right and wrong. The author's perspective is that the sister should have known they were valuable, but the sister didn't recognize the logo or the item's worth. The author then goes to apologize and set boundaries, which is a positive step. The buyer was informed and gave a 3-star review. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is responsible for keeping track of their inventory. If the cough drops were for resale, the sister might not have known their purpose. The author's anger over $35 profit (which is $45 total) and yelling at a family member could be seen as disproportionate. The sister's mistake was innocent, and the author could have handled it without yelling. \n\nBut the author did apologize and took responsibility, which is good. They also didn't make the sister pay, acknowledging it was an honest mistake. So maybe the author is in the wrong for their initial reaction but making amends now. \n\nHowever, the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering that the sister didn't intend to steal and the author's emotional response was harsh, leading to a family conflict over a relatively small amount, I think the author is in the wrong. The appropriate action might have been to explain the situation calmly and seek a solution, not to yell. So the answer should be A.\n"
