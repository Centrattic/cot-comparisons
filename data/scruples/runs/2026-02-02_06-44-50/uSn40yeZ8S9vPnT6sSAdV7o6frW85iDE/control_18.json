My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The sister ate them, and the author lost $35 profit. The author then drove to her college to apologize and set ground rules. The sister didn't know the value of the cough drops.\n\nFirst, the sister's action was accidental? She said she just liked the taste and didn't know their worth. So maybe she didn't realize they were valuable. The author was selling them on eBay, which is their business. But the sister's mistake led to the item being missing. The author was upset because of the $35 profit, which is significant for a business. However, yelling and causing a rift where the sister hasn't spoken since might be disproportionate. \n\nThe author took steps to apologize, which shows they recognized the issue. The sister's reaction was to leave, which might indicate she felt hurt. The author didn't make the sister pay, which is good. But the initial reaction was to yell, which could be seen as harsh if the sister didn't know the drops were for sale. \n\nSo, the main points are: Did the author overreact? The value was $45, which is a lot, but the sister was unaware. The author's yelling might have been the wrong approach. Maybe a better response was to explain the value instead of yelling. The author's follow-up actions (apology) show remorse. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because even though the cough drops were valuable, the sister didn't know. The author should have communicated the importance instead of yelling, leading to a bigger conflict. But maybe some would argue it's a business expense and the sister should have known better. However, the sister's lack of awareness and the author's subsequent apology suggest that the initial reaction was excessive. So, A makes sense.\n"
