My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The sister ate them without realizing their value, and the author is feeling bad about the argument that followed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both perspectives. The author spent time and effort selling the cough drops on eBay and made a profit, so the item had both monetary and sentimental value. The sister, on the other hand, might not have known they were valuable and ate them by mistake. \n\nThe author's reaction was yelling, which escalated the situation. While they later apologized and tried to make things right by visiting the sister, the initial reaction seems harsh for an honest mistake. The sister didn't intend to cause harm, so the yelling might have been disproportionate. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author made a profit but then had to explain the situation to the buyer and received a lower review adds stress, but that doesn't justify yelling. The sister's action was a mistake, not theft or malice. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author could have handled it calmly, explaining the value and asking for compensation if needed. Yelling and causing a rift over a mistake, even if the item was valuable, seems excessive. The resolution where the author apologizes and sets boundaries shows they recognized their mistake, but the initial reaction was wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because their response was disproportionately harsh given the sister's honest mistake. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
