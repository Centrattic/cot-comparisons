My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about yelling at their sister for eating $45 cough drops they were selling on eBay. The sister ate them thinking they were regular cough drops, didn't know their value. The author feels bad, apologized, and the sister hasn't talked to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's reaction was reasonable. The cough drops sold for $45, which seems high for something like that. Maybe they were designer or branded in a way that made them valuable. The sister didn't know they were being sold, so she ate them by mistake. The author yelled at her, which caused a rift. \n\nThe author's actions: They got angry and yelled, which led to the sister leaving. The question is whether this reaction was appropriate. The sister's mistake was honest; she didn't know their value. The author made a profit of $35, but losing a sibling relationship over that might be seen as disproportionate.\n\nAlso, the author did apologize and went to their college, which shows they recognized the mistake. They didn't make the sister pay, which is good. But the initial reaction of yelling was harsh given the sister's ignorance of the value. So the author might be in the wrong for overreacting. However, the situation is a bit messy. \n\nAnother angle: The author was selling items, so maybe they should have stored the items securely. If the sister didn't know they were for sale, maybe the author's responsibility is to keep them safe. But the sister eating them was a mistake. The author's anger might be justified in terms of losing the product, but the way they handled it was wrong. So the answer is a bit nuanced. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key points are the sister's honest mistake, the author's overreaction, and the emotional impact. The author is in the wrong for yelling and causing a rift over a mistake that wasn't intentional. So answer A.\n"
