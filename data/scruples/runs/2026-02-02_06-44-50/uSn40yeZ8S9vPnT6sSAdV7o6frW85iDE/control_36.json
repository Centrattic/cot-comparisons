My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they sold some Supreme cough drops on eBay for $45, made a $35 profit, but their sister ate them. The author got really upset and yelled at her sister, which led to a rift where the sister went back to college and hasn't talked to them since. The author later went to apologize but still set some ground rules.\n\nFirst, the key points here. The author was selling items on eBay, which is a business. The cough drops were part of that business, so losing them meant losing profit. The sister didn't realize the value of the item, as she just liked the taste. The author's reaction was yelling, which might have been over the top, especially since it's just cough drops. But the sister's action was unintentional. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to be upset because they were planning to sell the item and losing it affected their income. On the other hand, yelling and causing a family rift over something that wasn't intentional might be excessive. The fact that the sister didn't know the value of the item (maybe she didn't see the Supreme branding, which the author mentions) could mean she didn't realize the significance. \n\nThe author's apology and attempt to fix things by visiting the sister show that they recognize the mistake in their reaction. However, the initial reaction of yelling seems to be the main issue here. Family relationships are important, and overreacting to a non-malicious act could be seen as wrong. The author prioritized their profit over their sister's feelings, which might not be the right call, especially since the sister's action was a mistake.\n\nSo considering all that, the author probably is in the wrong for overreacting. The sister didn't intentionally take the cough drops, and the emotional response caused unnecessary harm. The author later made amends, which is good, but the initial action was the problem.\n"
