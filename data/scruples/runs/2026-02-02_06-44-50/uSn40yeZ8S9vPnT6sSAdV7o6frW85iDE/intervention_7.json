My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about the author yelling at their sister for eating cough drops that the author had sold on eBay for $45, making a $35 profit. The sister went back to college and they haven't talked since. The author later apologized and went to her college, but the sister was upset because she didn't know the value of the cough drops. The author also mentioned that the buyer gave a 3-star review after the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author made a profit on the cough drops, which the sister ate, leading to a confrontation where the author yelled. The sister left, and the author felt bad enough to apologize later. The sister's perspective was that the author was being overly harsh over something she didn't realize was valuable. The author didn't make the sister pay, considering it an honest mistake.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author overreacted. Yelling at a sister over a $35 profit might be seen as excessive, especially since the sister wasn't aware of their value. The fact that the author went to apologize and tried to make amends shows they recognized their mistake. However, the initial reaction of yelling seems unwarranted given that the sister had no intention of stealing or causing harm. The author's anger led to a significant fallout in their relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had a legitimate investment in the cough drops, expecting to sell them. The sister's action of eating them might have been careless, but the author's response of yelling could have been more proportionate. The sister's lack of awareness about the product's value (the logo) suggests it was an honest mistake. Therefore, the author's anger might have been based on a misunderstanding of the sister's intent. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the sister made a mistake, the author's choice to yell and cause a rift could be seen as the bigger issue. The author could have handled it calmly, explained the situation, and maybe set boundaries without yelling. The fact that they later apologized and tried to fix things supports the idea that they realized their initial reaction was wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong for overreacting and handling the situation poorly, leading to a strained relationship. The correct answer would be A.\n"
