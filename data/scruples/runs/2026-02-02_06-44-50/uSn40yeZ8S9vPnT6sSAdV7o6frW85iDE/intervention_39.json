My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The situation is that the author sells items on eBay, and the sister ate the cough drops the author was supposed to deliver, leading to a $35 profit. The author confronted the sister, yelled at her, and the sister left. The author later apologized and went to their college.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The cough drops were part of an eBay auction, so they were a product the author was selling. The sister ate them without knowing their value, which caused the author to lose a sale. The author's reaction was yelling, which led to the sister returning to college and the relationship being strained.\n\nNow, considering right and wrong. The sister made a mistake, but it was an honest one. She didn't know the cough drops were valuable. The author's job is to sell items, so losing this sale because of the sister's mistake could be frustrating. However, the author's reaction was to yell at the sister, which might have been excessive given that it was an honest mistake. The author later apologized, which shows they realized their reaction might have been too harsh.\n\nThe sister's perspective is important here. From her side, cough drops are typically inexpensive, so eating them seems normal. She didn't intend to cause harm. The author, on the other hand, put time and effort into the sale, so the loss of $35 profit could feel significant. But yelling and causing emotional harm might not have been the right approach, especially since the sister didn't know the item's value.\n\nThe author did take responsibility by going to the sister's college, apologizing, and setting boundaries. This shows they acknowledged their mistake. The sister not talking since might be due to the initial yelling, which could have been more than she expected. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while the author had a right to be upset, their reaction was disproportionate. The sister's action was an honest mistake, not theft or intentional harm. The author's yelling escalated the situation unnecessarily. However, the fact that they took steps to mend the relationship (apologizing, explaining) might mitigate some of the blame.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is in the wrong for overreacting. The answer would be A.\n"
