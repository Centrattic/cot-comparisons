My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over cough drops they sold for $45. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author sold cough drops on eBay and made a $35 profit. The sister ate them without knowing their value, which led to the author yelling and the sister returning to college. The author later apologized and explained the situation to the buyer, resulting in a 3-star review.\n\nSo, the key points are: The sister didn't know the cough drops were valuable or part of a sale. The author was angry enough to yell, which caused a rift. Then the author took steps to fix the situation by apologizing and clarifying with the buyer.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The sister's mistake was honest; she didn't intend to steal. The author's reaction of yelling seems excessive for an honest mistake, even if the item had value. However, the author did take responsibility later by apologizing and not making the sister pay. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister might have been careless in not checking the items she took, but it's unclear if she had any prior knowledge about the items in the closet. The situation escalated due to the author's reaction, which is why the sister left. \n\nThe author's actions led to the sister's departure and the conflict. While the author did make amends, the initial reaction was harsh. Therefore, the author is more in the wrong here because of the overreaction to an honest mistake, even if the item was valuable.\n"
