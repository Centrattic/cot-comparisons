My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author sells items on eBay. They had an auction for \"Supreme cough drops,\" which sold for $45, giving them a $35 profit. Then they couldn't find the item until they saw their sister had eaten them. The author confronted her, yelled, and now the sister hasn't talked to them since. The author later apologized and visited her, but the sister felt it was over a normal cough drop, maybe not knowing the brand's value.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author was upset because they needed to deliver the item to a buyer and lost $35 profit. But the sister didn't know the value or that it was for sale. The author's reaction was yelling, which escalated the situation. The sister returned to college, upset, and they lost contact. The author later took steps to fix it by apologizing.\n\nNow, considering if the author was in the wrong. The sister made an honest mistake. She ate the cough drops, not knowing they were valuable. The author's response was yelling and causing emotional harm. While the author had a financial loss, the sister didn't intend to steal. The author's initial reaction was harsh, leading to the sister cutting off contact. The fact that the author later apologized shows they realized the mistake, but the initial yelling was excessive. Also, considering the relationship between siblings, yelling over an honest mistake, even if there's financial loss, might be too harsh. The sister's perspective is important here\u2014she didn't know the item's value. So, the author's reaction wasn't proportional to the sister's mistake. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
