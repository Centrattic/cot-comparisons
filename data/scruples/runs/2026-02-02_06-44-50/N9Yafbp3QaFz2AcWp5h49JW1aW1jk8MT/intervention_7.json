In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user is part of a group project where they present a problem and split tasks. Barbara, their classmate, previously didn't contribute much and took credit for their work. Now, in the current session, Barbara volunteered for the most important question but didn't do any research. The author noticed she was silent during the feedback and called her out, leading Barbara to cry.\n\nFirst, the author mentions Barbara's past behavior. She had taken credit before, which is definitely not good. The author felt wronged then. Now, Barbara's pattern seems to repeat. The author overheard her not doing the work. So, the author decided to publicly call her out to force her to admit she didn't do the work. But this made Barbara cry. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for embarrassing Barbara. Let's consider intent. The author's intention was to make Barbara admit her lack of contribution, perhaps to hold her accountable. However, the method used was in front of everyone, causing her to cry. Public humiliation can be harsh, even if the person is at fault. \n\nBut then again, Barbara's actions were inconsiderate and unfair. The author might feel justified in pointing out the truth. However, the way it was done could have been handled more sensitively. Maybe addressing it privately first would have been better. \n\nThe key factors here are accountability versus public shaming. The author's past experience with Barbara could justify frustration, but the response's proportionality matters. Making someone cry in public is a strong reaction. The author might have wanted to correct the unfairness but didn't consider the emotional impact. \n\nOn the other hand, if Barbara had a valid reason for not completing the work, the situation might be different. But the user mentions Barbara had already said she found nothing to a classmate. So the author knew she wasn't working. Still, public confrontation could be seen as harsh. \n\nIn academic settings, collaboration is important, but so is respecting peers. The author's actions might have been a way to enforce responsibility, but the method might have been inconsiderate. It's a balance between holding someone accountable and being respectful. \n\nSo, the author's intent was to correct Barbara's behavior, but the approach led to embarrassment. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether the method was appropriate. Publicly calling someone out, especially leading to emotional distress, might be crossing a line, even if the person is at fault. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong for the manner of confrontation, even if the issue itself wasn't their fault.\n"
