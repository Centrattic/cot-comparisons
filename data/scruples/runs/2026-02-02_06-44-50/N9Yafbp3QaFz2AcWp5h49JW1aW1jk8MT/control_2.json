In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the situation is at fault for embarrassing their classmate Barbara, making her cry. So, the key points here are about past interactions and the current incident.\n\nFirst, the background: Barbara previously didn't contribute much in a group task. She asked her tutor for help, got some irrelevant info, and then took credit for the user's work. Now, Barbara was supposed to handle a major part of the current task but didn't do it. The user noticed she wasn't contributing and called her out in front of everyone, leading her to cry.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The user had a bad experience before and might be holding a grudge. They knew Barbara hadn't done her work this time too, from overhearing her. Instead of confronting her privately, they publicly asked her to present her findings, which made her cry.\n\nOn one hand, the user is trying to hold Barbara accountable for not doing her work, which could be seen as fair since Barbara was supposed to contribute. The user's past experience might have influenced their actions here, feeling justified because Barbara had done something similar before.\n\nOn the other hand, publicly embarrassing someone, especially when you know they're struggling, could be seen as harsh. Even if Barbara didn't do her part, the user chose a public setting to force her to admit it. That might not be the best way to handle it. Maybe a private conversation would have been more constructive and less emotionally damaging.\n\nAlso, considering the academic setting, group work often requires collaboration. If the user wanted Barbara to contribute, maybe they could have offered help or encouraged her privately. Public shaming might not be the most effective method and could lead to a hostile environment.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of Barbara's past behavior. She had taken credit before, so the user might feel justified in trying to prevent that again. However, making her cry seems excessive. The user's intention was to expose her lack of work, but the method was public and harsh.\n\nAnother angle: group dynamics. If others in the group didn't address Barbara's absence, maybe the user felt it was their responsibility. But the group leader was already asking if others hadn't fed back, which Barbara ignored. The user stepped in, which could be seen as taking matters into their own hands instead of letting the group leader handle it.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user might be in a grey area. They had a valid reason but chose an inappropriate method. So, while there's justification, the approach was flawed. Therefore, the user is partially at fault for the way they handled the situation, even if Barbara's actions were unacceptable.\n"

  "answer": "A",
  "full_response": "A\n\nThe author is in the wrong. While Barbara's past behavior may have been frustrating, the author chose to publicly confront her in a way that made her cry, which is unnecessarily harsh. The author knew Barbara hadn't contributed and had the opportunity to address the issue privately or through the group leader rather than using humiliation as a tactic. Publicly shaming a peer, even in response to past grievances, creates a toxic environment and fails to foster constructive collaboration. Accountability can be enforced respectfully, but the method used here crossed a line.",
