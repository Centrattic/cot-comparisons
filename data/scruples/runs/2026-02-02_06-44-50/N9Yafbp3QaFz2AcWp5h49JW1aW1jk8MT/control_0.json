In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate Barbara. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The author and Barbara have worked together before. Last time, Barbara didn't contribute much, just emailed a tutor for a generic sheet and then took credit for the author's work. The author was upset about that. Now, in a new group project, Barbara volunteered for the most important question. The author noticed she wasn't contributing, overheard her saying she couldn't find anything, and then called her out publicly, leading to Barbara crying.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent. The author explicitly states they wanted Barbara to admit she didn't do the work in front of everyone. That seems like a deliberate act to embarrass her. Even though Barbara had a history of not contributing, the method the author used was to humiliate her publicly. \n\nPublicly shaming someone, even if they've wronged you before, can be seen as crossing a line. The author's past experience might justify their frustration, but making Barbara cry in front of others is a harsh response. The author could have addressed the issue privately or reported it to the group leader or instructor without embarrassing her. \n\nAlso, the group's dynamic and the educational setting matter. The goal of the exercise is collaborative learning, and the author's action might undermine that by creating a hostile environment. Barbara might be stressed or facing her own issues, but the author's response was public shaming rather than a constructive approach.\n\nSo while Barbara's actions were inconsiderate, the author's response seems to be a form of retaliation that's harmful. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for choosing to embarrass Barbara publicly instead of handling it more discreetly or reporting the issue to an authority.\n"
