In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate, Barbara. The author explains a past incident where Barbara took credit for their work. Now, in the current situation, Barbara volunteered for the most important part of the task but didn't do any work. The author called her out in front of the group, leading her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a bad experience before with Barbara. That might have influenced their actions this time. They felt Barbara didn't contribute before and took credit. Now, they wanted to make sure she didn't do the same again. However, the method they used was to embarrass her publicly. \n\nIs it right to make someone cry over a group project? Even if Barbara didn't do her work, the author's approach seems harsh. Instead of confronting her in front of others, maybe addressing it privately would have been better. The author knew she hadn't done the work beforehand, so they had prior knowledge. They might have felt justified because of Barbara's past behavior, but public embarrassment can be hurtful. \n\nIn an academic setting, collaboration is key. If the author's goal was to ensure the group's success, maybe there were other ways to handle it. For example, offering help to Barbara before the feedback session or discussing the issue with the group leader. Shaming her publicly might have been a way to get back at her for past actions, which complicates the situation. \n\nThe author might have valid reasons for being frustrated, but the method used was inappropriate. Public humiliation can damage relationships and create a hostile environment. While Barbara didn't contribute, the author's actions were a personal vendetta rather than a constructive approach. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is probably in the wrong because they chose to embarrass Barbara instead of handling it more discreetly or constructively.\n"
