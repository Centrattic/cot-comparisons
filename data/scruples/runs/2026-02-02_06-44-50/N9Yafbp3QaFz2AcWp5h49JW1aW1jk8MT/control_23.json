In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a group presentation where Barbara didn't do her part. The user wants to know if they were right to call her out in front of everyone, leading her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The user's past experience with Barbara is negative\u2014Barbara took credit for their work last time. Now, this time Barbara volunteered for the most important question but didn't prepare. The user overheard her saying she couldn't find anything and then called her out during the feedback session. The key point is that the user's intention was to make her admit she didn't do the work publicly, which caused her to cry.\n\nOn one hand, the user might feel justified because Barbara didn't contribute before and is doing the same now. They might be trying to hold her accountable, especially since the group's success depends on everyone's input. However, doing this by embarrassing her could be seen as harsh. It's possible Barbara had personal issues or other reasons for not completing her work, and the user's approach might have been unkind, even if Barbara was at fault. \n\nOn the other hand, the user's action might prevent the group from failing due to Barbara's inaction. But calling her out in front of others, especially leading to her crying, could be considered bullying or not the most constructive way to address the problem. Maybe the user should have approached her privately first to understand the situation or encourage her to contribute without public shaming. \n\nThe user might argue that Barbara had it coming because of her past behavior, but others might say that publicly humiliating someone, even if they've done something wrong, isn't the right approach. The group setting is a professional or academic environment, so the user's actions could reflect poorly on their own conduct. \n\nAlso, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Even if Barbara didn't do her work, the user's method of addressing it might be inappropriate. It's possible that the user's intention was to teach a lesson, but the execution was too harsh. The emotional impact on Barbara is significant\u2014she cried and felt let down. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user might share some blame for not handling it more sensitively. While Barbara's inaction is problematic, the best approach might have been to talk to her first or inform the group leader. Embarrassing her publicly could be seen as crossing a line, even if motivated by past grievances. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might lean towards A (the user is in the wrong) because the method used was confrontational and led to emotional distress. However, there's a middle ground where both parties have some responsibility. The user's action was unkind, but Barbara's inaction is also a problem. Still, the question is about the user's wrongdoing. The act of embarrassing someone to the point of tears is likely inconsiderate, regardless of the prior issues.\n"
