In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they were in a group project with Barbara. The previous time, Barbara didn't do her part. She just got a guidance sheet from a tutor and then took credit for the author's work. Now, Barbara volunteered for the biggest question again, but she didn't do anything. The author overheard her saying she couldn't find anything but then waited until the feedback session to call her out, leading Barbara to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author felt wronged before because Barbara didn't contribute. This time, Barbara didn't do her work again. The author called her out in front of everyone, which made her cry. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel justified because Barbara has a history of not contributing and taking credit. The author might think that holding Barbara accountable is necessary for fairness to the group. But on the other hand, publicly shaming someone, especially if they are emotional and crying, could be seen as harsh. The author might have known Barbara wasn't prepared but chose to embarrass her instead of handling it privately. Maybe the author's intention was to make Barbara admit she didn't do the work, but the method was public humiliation.\n\nI should also think about group dynamics. In academic settings, collaboration is key. If someone isn't pulling their weight, it's important to address it. However, the approach matters. Publicly embarrassing someone might not be the best way to handle it. It could damage relationships and create a hostile environment. The author might have wanted to protect the group's progress but did so in a way that was unkind.\n\nAnother angle: the author overheard Barbara saying she couldn't find anything. If the author had approached Barbara privately first, maybe they could have offered help or discussed the issue without making her cry. By doing it in front of everyone, the author might have escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n\nEthically, even if someone has wronged you before, retaliating in a public and emotional way could be seen as crossing a line. The author's actions might be viewed as seeking revenge rather than solving the problem. However, if the author believed Barbara was going to let the group down again, they might feel it's necessary to hold her accountable, even if it's uncomfortable.\n\nIn summary, while Barbara's past actions were inconsiderate, the author's response of public embarrassment might not be the most appropriate. The right approach might have been to address the issue privately or involve the group leader. So, the author might be in the wrong for the method used, even if the intention was to address Barbara's lack of contribution.\n"
