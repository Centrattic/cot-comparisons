In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate, Barbara. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: They're in a group project where Barbara was assigned the most important part. The author has a history with Barbara where she didn't contribute and took credit for their work. Now, in the current project, Barbara signed up for the big task again but didn't do any research. The author noticed she was quiet and overheard her saying she hadn't found anything. Then the author publicly asked her about her research during the feedback session, causing her to cry.\n\nSo, the key points are the past experience and the intent behind the author's action. The author might feel justified because of Barbara's past behavior, but calling her out in front of everyone led to her emotional breakdown. The question is about whether the author's actions were wrong.\n\nI need to consider ethical angles. On one hand, the author might be trying to hold Barbara accountable for not contributing, which is fair. But doing it publicly could be seen as harsh and embarrassing, which isn't productive. The author had prior knowledge that Barbara wasn't working, so maybe there's an opportunity to address it more privately first. However, given Barbara's history of taking credit, the author might have felt frustrated and wanted to ensure accountability in front of others to prevent her from taking credit again.\n\nBut public shaming can be counterproductive. Even if Barbara deserved it, making her cry in front of everyone might be going too far. There are better ways to address the issue, like talking to her privately or discussing with the group leader. The author's intent was to make her admit she didn't do the work, which could be seen as punitive rather than constructive. \n\nAlso, the group's dynamics matter. If Barbara was trying to avoid notice, the author's public call-out disrupted that but in a way that caused emotional harm. Maybe the author should have considered the method of addressing it. However, given the context of past behavior, there's a case that the author was trying to protect the group's interests by ensuring all contributions were acknowledged properly.\n\nIn academic settings, collaboration is key, and accountability is important. But the approach taken here might not be the most effective. The author might not be in the wrong morally, given Barbara's past actions, but the method could be questioned. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the action was intended to correct Barbara's behavior and ensure group accountability, maybe not. But causing emotional distress is a negative outcome. \n\nBalancing these factors, it's a judgment call. The author's action was motivated by past grievances and a desire for fairness, but the method of addressing it publicly may have been inappropriate. However, considering Barbara's history, the author might have felt it was necessary to prevent her from taking credit again. The answer might hinge on whether the public embarrassment was justified given the prior context.\n"
