In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a graduate student who embarrassed their classmate, Barbara, in a group presentation.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is in a Masters program and is part of group work. In a previous instance, Barbara was assigned a task with the author. Barbara only did minimal work, got a guidance sheet from a tutor, and then took credit for the author's research. The author was upset about this. Now, in the current session, Barbara volunteered for the most important part of the task but didn't do any work. The author noticed she was quiet and had already failed the task. When the group leader asked for feedback, the author directly called out Barbara in front of everyone, leading her to cry.\n\nThe author is asking if they were in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nI need to consider group dynamics and ethical behavior. Was the author justified in calling out Barbara? In academic settings, collaboration is key, but there's also the aspect of accountability. Barbara's past behavior might have contributed to the author's frustration. However, making someone cry in front of others is harsh. The author might have wanted to hold Barbara accountable, but doing it publicly could be seen as embarrassing, which isn't effective. It might have been better to address the issue privately or through the group leader. By doing it publicly, the author might have overstepped, even if Barbara didn't do her work. \n\nOn the other hand, if Barbara was intentionally slacking and trying to hide it, the author's action could be a form of peer accountability. But the method used was confrontational and hurtful. The author might not be in the wrong entirely, but there's a possibility they could have handled it differently. Still, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since they intentionally embarrassed Barbara publicly, that's likely where the fault lies. So, the answer is probably A (Yes). Wait, but some might argue that Barbara's past behavior justifies it. However, public shaming is generally frowned upon. So maybe the author is in the wrong because there's a better way to handle it. Therefore, Answer A.\n"
