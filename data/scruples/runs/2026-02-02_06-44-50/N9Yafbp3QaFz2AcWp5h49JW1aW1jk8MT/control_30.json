In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for embarrassing their classmate, Barbara, by making her cry during a group presentation. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is in a Master's program where they work in groups on presentations. The setup is that they split tasks in the first session and then report back in the second. Barbara was assigned a major question last time, and the author had a bad experience where Barbara took credit for their work while not contributing. Now, this time Barbara chose the important question again but didn't do the research. The author noticed she wasn't contributing and then called her out publicly, leading to Barbara crying.\n\nSo the question is whether the author was wrong for doing that. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nLet me break down the key points. The author has a history with Barbara where Barbara didn't contribute and took credit. This time, Barbara was silent during the feedback. The author knew she hadn't done the work because they overheard her talking to a classmate. The author decided to publicly call her out, making her cry.\n\nNow, possible angles to consider. On one hand, the author might feel justified because of Barbara's past behavior. They might see it as holding her accountable. On the other hand, public shaming could be seen as harsh, especially in an academic setting where students might be under pressure. Also, the author's intent was to make Barbara admit she didn't do the work in front of everyone, which could be considered embarrassing. \n\nIs there a better way to handle it? Like talking to her privately first? But the author might not trust Barbara after the previous incident. Also, the group might need the information, so there's pressure to get Barbara to present. The author's action led to Barbara crying, which is a strong emotional reaction. \n\nLegally or ethically, is there a wrong here? Probably not legal, but in terms of interpersonal relations, public shaming can damage relationships. However, the author's past experience might have influenced their decision, thinking that Barbara would otherwise not contribute. \n\nBut was the author's action necessary? Maybe. If the group needed the information and Barbara wasn't providing, the author had to get her to speak up. However, doing it in a way that caused her to cry might be seen as harsh. The line between accountability and bullying is thin here. \n\nAlso, considering the group setting, maybe the author should have discussed with the group leader or tried another approach. But the immediate situation might not have allowed for that. \n\nIn academic contexts, collaboration is important, and sometimes people don't contribute. The author might feel justified in ensuring the group's work isn't affected by someone's lack of effort. However, the method used here was public embarrassment, which can have negative social consequences. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the action was intended to hold Barbara accountable due to her past behavior, maybe not. But if the action was unnecessarily harsh, then perhaps yes. It's a tricky situation where the author's intent was possibly to ensure group success, but the execution was poor. \n\nI think the answer might depend on the balance between accountability and empathy. The author had a valid reason due to Barbara's past actions, but the method of addressing it publicly could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not handling it more sensitively.\n"
