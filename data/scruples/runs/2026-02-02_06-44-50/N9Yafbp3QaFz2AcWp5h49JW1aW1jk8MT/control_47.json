In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate Barbara. The situation involves group work for a Masters program. The author has a history with Barbara where she previously didn't contribute and took credit for their work. Now, Barbara was supposed to research an important question again but didn't do it. The author called her out in front of the group, making her cry.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The author mentions past issues with Barbara taking credit and not contributing. This might influence their actions now. The current situation: Barbara volunteered for a key task but didn't follow through. The author knew she hadn't done any work because they overheard her. They then publicly asked her to present her findings, leading to her crying.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they might feel justified due to Barbara's past behavior. However, publicly shaming someone, even if deserved, can be seen as harsh. The author's intent was to make Barbara admit she didn't do the work, which could be seen as seeking revenge or holding her accountable. But the method of doing it in front of others might be unkind. \n\nThe group dynamics and academic setting matter. In academic groups, collaboration is key, and if someone isn't contributing, it's disruptive. The author might have felt they had to address it, but the public embarrassment could have been handled more privately. The emotional response of Barbara (crying) suggests it had a significant impact.\n\nPossible arguments for the author being in the wrong: They used public shaming, which is a harsh response. Even if Barbara didn't do the work, confronting her privately might have been more appropriate. The prior history might justify frustration, but that doesn't excuse making her cry in front of others.\n\nArguments against the author being in the wrong: Barbara had a chance to contribute and chose not to, possibly knowing she wouldn't. The author is holding her accountable for responsibilities she took on, which is fair. The previous incident where Barbara took credit might have escalated the tension.\n\nBalancing these points: While Barbara's inaction is problematic, the author's method of addressing it might be unprofessional. Public humiliation can be counterproductive and damaging to group morale. The author's intent was to enforce accountability, but the approach could be seen as unkind, especially given Barbara's emotional state.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they chose a public and emotionally harmful method to address the issue, even if their intent was to hold Barbara accountable. However, there's a counterpoint if the group leader didn't address it, the author might feel responsible. But in academic settings, there are usually other channels to report free-riding without personal confrontation.\n"
