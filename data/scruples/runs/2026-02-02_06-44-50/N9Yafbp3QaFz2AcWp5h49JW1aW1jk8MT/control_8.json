In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a group project where Barbara didn't do her part before, and the author is now dealing with her again. The key points are: Barbara previously took credit for the author's work, and this time she was supposed to research a big question but didn't do it. The author called her out in front of everyone, leading her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a bad experience with Barbara in the past. That might have influenced their actions this time. The author mentions overhearing Barbara say she hadn't found anything. So they knew Barbara wasn't doing her part. The author's intention was to make Barbara admit her failure in front of everyone. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. On one hand, calling someone out publicly can be harsh, especially if it makes them cry. But on the other hand, Barbara didn't do her work, and the author might have felt justified because of her past behavior. The author's motivation was to hold Barbara accountable, perhaps to prevent her from taking credit again. \n\nBut wait, the group project setup is part of a structured course. Maybe there are protocols for addressing non-participation. If the author bypassed that and went straight to public confrontation, that could be the issue. Also, even if Barbara didn't do her work, the author's approach might have been unkind. However, given Barbara's history, the author might have felt it was necessary to expose her to ensure the group's success. \n\nAnother angle: the group's dynamics. If Barbara was avoiding contributing, the author's action might have been a way to push her to take responsibility. But making her cry seems like a negative outcome. However, the author might argue that Barbara's prior actions (taking credit before) warranted this response.\n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because of Barbara's past behavior and the context of her not contributing. But it's a close call. The act of embarrassing someone publicly is generally frowned upon, but the circumstances might justify it. So maybe the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
