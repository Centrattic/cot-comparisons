In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a group project in a Master's class. The author and Barbara have worked together before, and there was a past incident where Barbara didn't contribute much. She emailed a tutor, got a sheet, and then took credit for the author's work during their presentation. Now, in the current project, Barbara volunteered for the most important part but didn't do any work. The author noticed she was quiet and then called her out, leading her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of group work. In academic settings, collaboration is key, and everyone is expected to contribute. But there's also a responsibility to handle conflicts appropriately. The author's motivation here seems to be about getting Barbara to admit she didn't do her work, possibly to hold her accountable, especially after the previous incident. However, doing this in front of everyone might have been harsh, especially since Barbara ended up crying. \n\nIs embarrassment a justified response? The author might feel wronged because of Barbara's past behavior, but publicly shaming someone can be seen as unprofessional and counterproductive. The question is whether the author's actions were a necessary step to ensure accountability or if they crossed a line by humiliating Barbara. \n\nAlso, the author overheard Barbara talking to a classmate about not finding anything. So they knew Barbara wasn't doing the work. But instead of addressing her privately or working with the group leader to handle it, they chose to confront her publicly. That might have been an intentional move to make her feel the consequences, but it's possible that a more constructive approach, like discussing it privately or informing the instructor, would have been better. \n\nConsidering the outcome, Barbara was embarrassed and upset. Even if the author had valid reasons, the method used could be seen as harsh. It's important to balance accountability with empathy. So, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but their approach was questionable. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer depends on the context of the situation and the intent behind the action. If the author's intent was to expose Barbara's lack of work, maybe they thought it was necessary for the group's progress. But making someone cry publicly suggests that the approach was too harsh, even if the underlying issue was valid. \n\nSo, based on that reasoning, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they chose a public and potentially hurtful method to address a group work issue that could have been handled more constructively. Alternatively, if the situation required immediate accountability and the group leader wasn't addressing it, maybe B is the answer. But generally, public shaming is frowned upon, so A is more likely.\n"
