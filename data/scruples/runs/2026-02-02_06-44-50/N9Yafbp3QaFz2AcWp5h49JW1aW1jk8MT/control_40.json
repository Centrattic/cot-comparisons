In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate, Barbara. The situation involves group work in a master's program. The key points are the past experience where Barbara took credit for the author's work and this time didn't do her part. The author called her out in front of everyone, leading to her crying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has a history of being taken advantage of by Barbara. Last time, Barbara used someone else's work and got credit. Now, the author is trying to hold Barbara accountable again. But the question is whether the method was wrong.\n\nThe author overheard Barbara saying she couldn't find anything. Instead of approaching her privately, the author publicly called her out during the session. The intention was to make Barbara admit her lack of work in front of others. That led to Barbara breaking down.\n\nThe problem here is about public shaming versus addressing the issue. In a group setting, especially academic, collaboration is key. If Barbara wasn't contributing, it's a problem. But the method of addressing it matters. Publicly embarrassing someone, even if they've done something wrong before, can be seen as harsh and unprofessional. It might not be constructive and could create a hostile environment. \n\nOn the other hand, Barbara did have a history of not contributing, so the author might feel justified in trying to expose that again. However, the approach taken could have been handled more diplomatically. Maybe approaching Barbara after the session or discussing it with the group leader first would have been better. \n\nThe intention is important. The author's goal was to hold Barbara accountable, but the method led to emotional distress. Even if Barbara deserved it, causing her to cry seems excessive. It's possible the author wanted to prevent her from taking credit again, but there are more constructive ways to handle that without public humiliation.\n\nSo, considering the context, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because there was a pattern of behavior, but the method used was inappropriate. The answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because of the public shaming, even if the intent was good. Alternatively, maybe not (B), given Barbara's history. But I think the wrong part is the public call-out. So answer A.\n"
