In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate, Barbara, in front of everyone. The situation involves group work where Barbara didn't contribute properly before and the author is now confronting her again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions a past incident where Barbara didn't do her part, took credit for their work, and didn't even present her own irrelevant research. Now, Barbara chose the most important question again, did nothing, and the author called her out in front of the group, leading Barbara to cry.\n\nSo, on one hand, the author's past experience with Barbara was negative, and they might feel justified in addressing the issue this time. They might think that Barbara is repeating the same behavior and that calling her out is necessary for accountability. However, doing so in front of everyone could be seen as harsh or embarrassing, which is why the question is being asked.\n\nOn the other hand, embarrassing someone publicly can be hurtful and unproductive. Even if Barbara didn't contribute, the author's approach might have been too direct without giving Barbara an opportunity to explain or correct herself. Maybe there was a way to address the issue more privately or through the group leader instead of singling her out, leading to emotional distress.\n\nAlso, the author might be holding a grudge from the previous incident, which could influence their actions. It's possible that the author's intent was to make Barbara face the consequences in front of others, which could come off as vengeful rather than constructive.\n\nI should consider group dynamics and academic settings. In educational environments, collaboration is key, but so is respect. Public shaming might not be the best approach, even if someone is slacking. There might be other ways to handle the situation that are more constructive for everyone involved.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be understandable given Barbara's past behavior, but the method of confrontation might be inappropriate. The key points are intent and impact. The intent was to hold Barbara accountable, but the impact was making her cry, which is significant. The question is whether the author overstepped.\n\nIn conclusion, while Barbara's inaction is problematic, the author's approach of public embarrassment might be inconsiderate. The answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because of the public humiliation, even if there was a reason. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the action was a justified response to repeated slacking. But I think the public nature of the confrontation and the emotional impact on Barbara make the author at least partially responsible. So, likely answer A.\n"
