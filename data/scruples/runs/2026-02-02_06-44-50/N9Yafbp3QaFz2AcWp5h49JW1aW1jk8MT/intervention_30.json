In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a student who called out their classmate, Barbara, during a group presentation. The key points here are the past interaction where Barbara didn't contribute and took credit for the author's work, leading to the current scenario where the author confronted Barbara in front of everyone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a previous bad experience with Barbara. Barbara had relied on someone else's work and didn't contribute, then took credit. Now, in the current group task, Barbara volunteered for the most important question but didn't do any research. The author overheard her saying she couldn't find anything and then called her out during the feedback session, causing Barbara to cry.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's intention was to make Barbara admit she didn't do the work in front of everyone. Even though there was prior misconduct, intentionally embarrassing someone publicly can be seen as harsh. However, the author might argue that Barbara's inaction affected the group's work, and the confrontation was to address accountability.\n\nIn academic settings, collaboration is key, and holding members accountable is important. But the method of confrontation matters. Public embarrassment might not be the best approach, even if justified. The author could have addressed it privately first. However, the prior incident might have influenced the author's decision to take a stronger stance.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether public shaming is an appropriate response to someone's failure to contribute, especially after a previous incident. Some might say the author had a right to hold Barbara accountable, while others might think it was unkind. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is seeking confirmation. I need to decide between A and B based on these factors.\n"
