In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is at fault for embarrassing their classmate, Barbara. The situation seems a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the background: The author and Barbara have worked together before. Last time, Barbara didn't do much work. She asked her tutor for help, got a guidance sheet, but didn't contribute her own research. Then, during the presentation, Barbara took credit for the author's work. The author was upset about that.\n\nNow, in the current scenario, Barbara is in another group task. She volunteered for the most important part. The author noticed she wasn't contributing and had actually said she couldn't find anything. The author then publicly asked her about her research in front of everyone, which led Barbara to cry.\n\nThe key points here are: past behavior of Barbara, the author's intent to confront her publicly, and the resulting emotional response. The author admits they wanted Barbara to admit in front of everyone that she didn't do the work, which caused her to cry.\n\nI need to consider if the author's actions were justified. On one hand, Barbara did nothing and maybe deserved some accountability. On the other hand, making her cry and embarrassing her could be seen as harsh. The author's intent was revenge or ensuring accountability, but the method was public shaming. \n\nIn academic settings, collaboration is important. If someone isn't contributing, it's a problem. But confronting her in a public setting might not be the best approach. The author could have addressed it privately first. Also, Barbara's past behavior doesn't excuse the author's actions, but it does provide context. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether public shaming was the appropriate response. Even if Barbara didn't do the work, embarrassing her to the point of tears might be crossing a line. The author's intent was to make her admit failure publicly, which could be seen as vindictive, not just corrective. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong for the method used, even if the intent was to hold Barbara accountable. Public humiliation isn't the best way to address the issue. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
