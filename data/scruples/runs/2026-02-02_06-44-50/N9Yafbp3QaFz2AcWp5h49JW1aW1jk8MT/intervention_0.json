In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate Barbara.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and Barbara worked together before. Last time, Barbara didn't do much, just emailed a tutor for a sheet that wasn't really relevant, and then took credit for the author's work. The author was upset about that.\n\nNow, in the current situation, Barbara was assigned the most important question. The author noticed she wasn't contributing and heard her say she found nothing. The author then called her out in front of everyone, making her cry. The author admits they wanted her to say in front of everyone that she didn't do anything.\n\nHmm. On one hand, Barbara didn't do her part again. The author might feel justified because of past experiences. But on the other hand, publicly shaming someone, especially to the point of making them cry, could be seen as harsh. The author could have addressed it privately instead. Also, the motivation here is revenge, given the previous incident. That might not be the right approach.\n\nIs there a better way? Maybe talking to the group leader or providing support instead of embarrassing her. The author's actions might have been hurtful and counterproductive, even if Barbara was at fault. Public shaming can damage relationships and group dynamics. Even if Barbara deserved it, the method was inappropriate.\n\nSo, the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they chose to embarrass Barbara publicly instead of handling it more constructively.\n"
