In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate, Barbara. The situation involves past experiences where Barbara didn't contribute much and took credit, and this time, she didn't do her part again. The author called her out in front of everyone, leading Barbara to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions were justified. The author has a history with Barbara where Barbara underperformed and took credit. This time, Barbara chose the most important part of the task but didn't do the work. The author overheard her talking about not finding anything but waited until the feedback session to confront her publicly.\n\nThe key points here are intent and the method used. The author admits they wanted Barbara to have to say in front of everyone that she didn't do the work. That suggests a deliberate intent to embarrass her. Even if Barbara didn't do her part, publicly shaming someone, especially leading them to cry, is harsh. The author could have approached this differently, maybe speaking to Barbara privately first or working with the group leader to handle the situation without public humiliation. \n\nAlso, considering the academic context, it's important to maintain a respectful environment. While Barbara's past behavior might be frustrating, the author's response was to make her cry publicly, which could be seen as bullying or retaliation. The author's actions might have caused more harm than good, affecting Barbara's well-being and possibly the group dynamics negatively. \n\nOn the other hand, Barbara did choose the most important task and failed to deliver, so there's some accountability on her side. However, the method of confrontation is where the author might be in the wrong. Public shaming isn't an effective way to address academic underperformance, especially in a professional or academic setting. The author should have considered alternative solutions that don't involve embarrassing a peer, even if there's a history of issues.\n\nIn conclusion, while Barbara's actions were problematic, the author's response was inappropriate. The answer is A.\n"
