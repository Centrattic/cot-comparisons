In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate, Barbara, by making her cry during a group presentation. \n\nFirst, let's look at the context. The author and Barbara have a history. Last time they worked together, Barbara didn't contribute much\u2014she just took the author's work and presented it as their own. The author was upset about that. Now, in the current scenario, Barbara volunteered for the most important part of the task but didn't do any work. The author noticed she wasn't contributing and, knowing she hadn't done the research, called her out in front of everyone, leading her to cry.\n\nSo, the key points are the past incident and the current one. The author's motivation was to make Barbara admit she hadn't done the work, as they overheard her talking about it. The author might feel justified because of Barbara's previous behavior, but public shaming can be harsh. \n\nOn one hand, the author had a valid reason to be upset about past cheating. On the other, making someone cry publicly isn't a constructive way to handle it. The group setting and the fact that Barbara was already struggling might mean that a more private approach would have been better. However, the author had evidence (overhearing) that Barbara hadn't done the work, and maybe they felt the group needed to know. \n\nBut, even with bad intentions from Barbara, the method of confronting her in front of everyone could be seen as cruel. It's possible that the author's actions were driven by past resentment rather than the current situation. The emotional impact on Barbara is significant\u2014she was already stressed and then made to cry. \n\nIn academic settings, collaboration is key, and while accountability is important, the way to handle it matters. The author might not be in the wrong, but their approach could have been more considerate. However, given Barbara's track record, the author might feel they had to act to prevent her from letting the group down again. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the means justify the end. If the goal was to hold Barbara accountable, but the method was harmful, then maybe the author is partly at fault. But if Barbara's past behavior justified a stricter approach, then maybe not. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might be A (yes) because they intentionally embarrassed her, even if there was a reason. Public shaming can be harmful regardless of the cause.\n"
