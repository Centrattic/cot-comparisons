In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate Barbara. The situation is about group work for a Master's program. The author had a past experience where Barbara didn't contribute and took credit for their work. Now, Barbara was assigned the most important question again but didn't do any research. The author intentionally called her out in front of the group, leading her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that Barbara had a history of not contributing and taking credit. They felt justified in exposing her this time because her inaction could harm the group's work. But on the other hand, deliberately embarrassing someone can be seen as harsh, even if the person is at fault. \n\nThe key points here are intent and the method used. The author wanted Barbara to admit she didn't do the work in front of everyone, knowing she hadn't done anything. Even if Barbara is responsible, the approach might have been too confrontational. Public humiliation can be counterproductive and hurtful, regardless of the justification.\n\nAlso, considering group dynamics in academic settings, collaboration is important. While accountability is necessary, the way the author handled it could have damaged team cohesion and Barbara's well-being. There might have been other ways to address Barbara's lack of contribution without making her cry. \n\nHowever, Barbara's past behavior does add context. The author might feel they were protecting the group's interests. But the question is whether the method was appropriate. Even if Barbara deserved it, embarrassing someone publicly could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, balancing the intent (holding someone accountable) against the method (public shaming), it's a bit of a dilemma. The author's actions were harsh, especially given Barbara's emotional response. There's a case to be made that the author is in the wrong because the approach was unnecessarily harsh, even if the motivation was to address Barbara's inaction. Alternatively, some might argue that holding people accountable is necessary, and the author is not in the wrong.\n\nGiven that the user thinks the author is in the wrong, I need to see if that's justified. Publicly calling out someone who is avoiding responsibility might not be the best approach, especially if it leads to emotional distress. The author's past with Barbara is valid, but the response here could be seen as excessive. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because the method used was too harsh and hurtful, despite the justification.\n"
