In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. So, the author of the story is asking if they did something wrong by embarrassing their classmate, Barbara, in front of everyone and making her cry. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a group project for their Masters. Barbara, their classmate, had previously taken credit for the author's work. Now, Barbara volunteered for the most important part of the current task but didn't do any work. The author noticed Barbara wasn't contributing and decided to call her out in front of the group, which made Barbara cry.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that Barbara didn't do her work, and they wanted to make her admit it publicly. The author might feel justified because of the past incident with Barbara taking credit, but is this the right approach?\n\nLet me break it down. The key points here are:\n\n1. Past incident: Barbara took credit for the author's work. This is a significant issue because it's dishonest and affects group dynamics.\n2. Current situation: Barbara volunteered for the most important task but didn't do any research. The author found out she wasn't contributing and decided to publicly call her out, leading to Barbara crying.\n3. The author's intention was to make Barbara admit she didn't do the work in front of everyone, possibly to hold her accountable or prevent her from taking credit again.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. Publicly shaming someone, even if they've wronged you before, can have negative consequences. It might be seen as unkind or harsh, especially if it causes someone to cry. However, Barbara wasn't contributing, and the author felt she had taken credit before, so there's a sense of wanting fairness.\n\nBut is the author's action justified? In a group project, accountability is important. If someone isn't contributing, it's a problem for the whole group. However, the method of addressing it matters. Instead of embarrassing her, maybe the author could have approached her privately first. Public shaming might not be the best approach, even if the person is at fault.\n\nAlso, the author knew Barbara had already admitted to someone else she hadn't done the work. So, the author might have been trying to force her to take responsibility, but doing it in front of everyone could be seen as harsh. It's possible that the author's past experience with Barbara made them more aggressive in their approach, but that doesn't necessarily excuse public humiliation.\n\nOn the other hand, Barbara's actions were irresponsible and potentially dishonest. The author might feel that by not addressing it, Barbara would get away with it again. But the method of addressing it is questionable.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's action was wrong. If the action was meant to correct Barbara's behavior but done in a way that was unnecessarily harsh, then the author might be in the wrong. However, if the intention was to hold Barbara accountable and prevent her from letting the group down again, there's a case for the author not being in the wrong. \n\nBut generally, in such situations, it's better to address issues privately first. Publicly embarrassing someone, even if they've wronged you, can be seen as inconsiderate and might not resolve the underlying issue. The author's approach might have caused emotional harm, which could be seen as wrong regardless of Barbara's past actions. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A), but there's a counterargument that they had a reason. However, the method is likely the issue here.\n"
