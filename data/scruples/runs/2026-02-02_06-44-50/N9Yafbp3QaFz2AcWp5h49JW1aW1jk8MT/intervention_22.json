In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate, Barbara.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a master's program where they work in groups for presentations. Last time, Barbara was supposed to work on a task with the author. The author did most of the work, and Barbara ended up taking credit. Now, in this new group, Barbara volunteered for the most important question but didn't do any research. The author, knowing that Barbara hadn't contributed anything, called her out in front of the group, leading her to cry.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. The options are A (Yes, the author is wrong) or B (No, they're not).\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's actions were out of frustration from Barbara's previous behavior and the current situation where Barbara wasn't contributing. The author might feel that Barbara was slacking again and wanted to expose her. However, calling her out publicly led to her emotional distress. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, even if Barbara didn't do her work, the method of addressing it matters. Public shaming can be counterproductive and hurtful. The author might have had valid reasons but handled it poorly. Alternatives could have been talking to her privately first or confronting her in a more constructive way. \n\nBut Barbara's actions in the past were dishonest, taking credit for someone else's work. Maybe the author felt justified in holding her accountable. However, making her cry in front of everyone could be seen as an overreaction. \n\nI should weigh the intent versus the outcome. The author's intent was to get Barbara to admit she hadn't done the work, but the outcome was public embarrassment and emotional harm. Even if the author had a reason, the approach might be considered inappropriate. \n\nIn academic settings, collaboration is key, and conflicts should be handled constructively. Publicly humiliating a peer might damage group dynamics and create a hostile environment. The author could be seen as not taking responsibility for their part in escalating the situation, especially if there was a chance to address it more privately.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were harsh and unkind, even if Barbara was at fault. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
