In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate Barbara. So, first, I need to understand the context thoroughly.\n\nThe author is in a Master's program where they work in groups on presentations. In their previous collaboration with Barbara, Barbara didn't contribute much. She asked a tutor for help, got a sheet, and then presented the author's work as their own. The author felt wronged then. Now, Barbara volunteered to tackle the most important part of the current task but didn't do any work. The author noticed she was quiet during the feedback session and then called her out in front of everyone, leading her to cry.\n\nThe key points here are past grievances and the current action. The author's motivation was to make Barbara admit she didn't do the work, which caused embarrassment. The question is whether this was justified.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, public shaming, even if motivated by past mistreatment, can be harmful. It's important to consider intent and the consequence. The author wanted to expose Barbara's lack of work, but doing so in front of others led to Barbara crying, which is a negative outcome. However, Barbara did fail in her responsibilities again. The author might feel justified in holding her accountable, but the method used was harsh.\n\nAnother angle is the group dynamic. The author's action could affect their reputation and future collaborations. Publicly calling someone out without a private conversation first might be seen as inconsiderate. Also, even if Barbara didn't do her part, the author could have addressed it in a more constructive way, like discussing privately or with the group leader.\n\nOn the other hand, Barbara's actions in the past were passive-aggressive and deceitful, so the author might feel justified in retaliation. However, retaliation isn't always the best response. The situation becomes a cycle of conflict rather than resolution.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's intent was to hold Barbara accountable, but the public nature of the confrontation was unkind. The result was emotional distress, which is a significant downside. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the method used, even if there's a reason behind it.\n"
