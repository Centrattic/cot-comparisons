In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're at fault for embarrassing their classmate Barbara. The situation is about group work for a master's program. The user had a previous bad experience with Barbara where she didn't contribute, took credit for their work, and used someone else's guidance sheet without adding her own input. Now, in a new group task, Barbara volunteered for the biggest question but didn't do any work. The user knew she hadn't done anything because they overheard her talking to another classmate. Then, when the group was giving feedback, the user called out Barbara, leading her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user feels justified because Barbara didn't do her part before and again. They wanted to make her accountable. However, making her cry in front of everyone could be seen as harsh. The user's intention was to expose her, but maybe there's a better way to handle it without public humiliation. \n\nIn academic settings, collaboration is key, but so is respect. Maybe the user should have addressed Barbara privately first instead of calling her out publicly. Public shaming can damage relationships and create a hostile environment. Even though Barbara didn't contribute, the method the user chose might be crossing a line. \n\nOn the other hand, if Barbara is consistently not pulling her weight, others might feel frustrated. The user might have felt that the group's work was being compromised, so they wanted to ensure everyone contributed. But instead of embarrassing her, maybe the user could have discussed it with the group leader or approached Barbara individually to resolve the issue. \n\nAlso, the user's past experience adds context. They were wronged before, which might have influenced their reaction this time. However, revenge or public confrontation isn't typically a constructive response. It's important to balance accountability with empathy. \n\nSo, while Barbara's behavior was inconsiderate and unprofessional, the user's response might have been too harsh. There could have been more constructive ways to handle the situation. Therefore, the user might be partially at fault for the method they used, even if their intention was to hold Barbara accountable.\n"
