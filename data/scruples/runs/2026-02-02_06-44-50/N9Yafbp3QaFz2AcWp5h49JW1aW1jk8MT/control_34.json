In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is about a group project in their master's class. Barbara, a classmate, previously didn't do her part, took credit for someone else's work. Now, Barbara volunteered for the most important part of the task again but didn't do it. The author, knowing Barbara didn't do the work, called her out in front of everyone, leading Barbara to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Barbara has a history of not contributing and taking credit. The author might feel justified in holding her accountable. But the method was public shaming. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for embarrassing Barbara.\n\nPossible angles: Was the author's intention to help the group by ensuring all parts of the project are covered? If Barbara didn't do her part, the group might suffer. But making her cry is emotional distress. The author might argue they were trying to be fair, but others might see it as cruel. Also, the author had prior bad experiences, which influences their actions.\n\nAnother point: The author had overheard Barbara saying she couldn't find anything, yet still called her out in front of others. Was there a better way to handle it, like approaching her privately first? That could have avoided public embarrassment.\n\nLegal or ethical standpoint: Public humiliation can be considered unkind, but if the author's action was to enforce accountability in a group setting, maybe it's seen as necessary. However, emotional harm is a factor here. The line between accountability and bullying is thin.\n\nAlso, academic integrity is important. If Barbara isn't contributing, the group's work could be compromised, so the author might feel the need to address it. But did the author's approach cross the line?\n\nIn similar situations, people might suggest addressing the issue privately first. By doing it publicly, the author might be in the wrong because they prioritized their own frustration over Barbara's feelings, even if she's at fault. However, the author's past experience with Barbara might justify a harsher response.\n\nSo, the possible answer could be that the author is not entirely in the wrong because of Barbara's prior actions, but the method was inappropriate. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong at all. Since they intentionally made Barbara say she didn't do the work in front of everyone, leading to her crying, that's likely where the wrong is. So answer A: Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
