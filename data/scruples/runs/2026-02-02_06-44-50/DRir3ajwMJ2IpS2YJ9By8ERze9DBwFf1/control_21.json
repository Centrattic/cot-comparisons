He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old. \n\nFirst, I need to check the legal aspects. In the US, the age of consent varies by state, but generally, 18 is the standard. So if the girl is 18, the relationship is legal. The author mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, which makes sense if the girl turned 18 recently. So legally, there's no issue here.\n\nNext, the social and ethical angle. The author is concerned about the age gap. Even though they're both adults, a 13-year age difference can lead to power imbalances. The 18-year-old might be less experienced, which could affect the relationship's dynamics. The author's intention is to protect their friend, thinking that their friend might not realize the girl is too young. But is that the author's place to decide?\n\nThe friend is an adult, so he has the right to choose his partners. The author's actions involve actively trying to prevent the relationship, even confronting the girl directly. That might be overstepping. The friend could feel his autonomy is being violated, even if the author's intentions are good.\n\nAlso, the author mentions their friend has been lonely and is struggling with relationships. Maybe the author is projecting their own fears or biases about age gaps. The key question is whether the author has the right to interfere in another adult's personal choices, even if they think it's for their friend's good.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, friends can give advice, but actively trying to sabotage a relationship without consent isn't acceptable. The author's actions might be causing more harm by undermining their friend's judgment and possibly damaging trust.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the author's concern might be valid in terms of potential imbalances, they don't have the right to intervene in such a direct way. The friend is an adult, so the author is in the wrong for taking it upon themselves to control his decisions.\n"
