He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is trying to stop their 31-year-old friend from pursuing a relationship with an 18-year-old girl. The author is concerned about the age difference and thinks the girl looks much younger, even though both are legally adults. They've tried to discourage their friend and the girl, but it's not working.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, the legal age of consent is 18, so the girl is an adult. The age difference here is 13 years, which might raise some eyebrows, but legally, it's allowed. However, some states have close-in-age exemptions, but since the girl is 18, those probably don't apply here. So legally, there's no issue.\n\nNext, the ethical side. The author is worried about the power dynamics. A 31-year-old and an 18-year-old have a significant age gap. An 18-year-old is just starting most of their adult life, while the 31-year-old has more life experience. This could lead to an imbalance in the relationship where one person might have more influence over the other. But since both are consenting adults, some might argue that it's their choice.\n\nThe author mentions that the girl might look younger, which makes them uncomfortable. But appearance is subjective. Just because someone looks younger doesn't mean they're not mature enough. The author is making assumptions about the girl's maturity based on her looks, which might not be fair.\n\nThe author is also trying to interfere by talking to both the friend and the girl. While their intentions might be to protect their friend from potential heartbreak or legal issues (if there were any), they're not the ones directly involved. It's common for friends to give advice, but actively trying to prevent a relationship could be seen as overstepping, especially if the girl is willing to engage.\n\nThe other friend involved in this is also doing the same. They're trying to find ways to keep them apart. If the girl is showing interest and the guy is willing to pursue it, the author's actions could be seen as meddling. Unless there's clear evidence of harm or coercion, it's a consensual relationship between two adults, so the author might be in the wrong for interfering.\n\nHowever, the author's concern about their friend's past loneliness and the guy's awkwardness could be valid. Maybe they're worried about their friend being taken advantage of, but again, unless there's evidence of that, it's speculative. The author might be projecting their own discomfort with the age gap rather than addressing the actual issues their friend has with relationships.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions might be good, they're not legally or ethically in the right to prevent two consenting adults from being together. Their actions could be seen as controlling and not respecting the autonomy of both individuals involved. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
