He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. So first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe friend is 31, and the girl is 18. Both are adults, so legally, there's no problem. But the author thinks the girl looks much younger, maybe like 16, and that this is creepy. The author and another friend are actively trying to stop them from getting together. The author even approached the girl directly and discouraged her, and they're trying to keep the friend away. \n\nI need to consider a few things. Legally, the age of consent varies, but in many places, 18 is the legal age. So their relationship, if consensual, is legal. The author's concern might be about the age difference, but maybe that's their own discomfort. Also, the author mentions the girl might be just a friend, but the friend is interested in a romantic relationship. \n\nIs it the author's place to intervene? Friends often give advice, but does the author have the right to actively prevent their friend from dating someone? The friend is an adult and can make his own decisions. The author might be motivated by concern, but is it right to interfere without clear evidence of harm? The author says the friend is lonely and has had trouble with relationships, so maybe the friend is just trying to find connection. \n\nAlso, the author's own judgment about the girl's appearance (thinking she looks 16) could be a personal bias. The legal age is 18, so even if she looks younger, as long as she's 18, it's not illegal. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially if they approached the girl and discouraged her. That might be crossing a line into interfering with someone else's autonomy. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author is genuinely concerned about their friend's well-being, maybe they think the relationship could be harmful. But without knowing the girl's intentions or the context of their relationship, the author is making assumptions. The girl might be mature and the relationship consensual. \n\nIn many cases, people have the right to form relationships as long as they're adults. The author's actions could be seen as controlling or interfering unnecessarily. The friend is an adult and should be free to make his own choices, even if others disapprove. Unless there's exploitation or harm, the author might not have the right to prevent their friend from pursuing a relationship. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because they're interfering in their friend's personal life without justification. The answer could be A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). But I need to decide based on the reasoning. Since the author is taking active steps to stop their friend from dating someone legal and consensual, that's likely overstepping. So the answer is A.\n"
