He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, the age of consent is 18, so the relationship isn't illegal. The user mentions that just a few months ago it would have been illegal, implying that the girl is very close to 18, maybe 16 or 17, but now she's 18. So legally, there's no issue here. The author is worried about the age difference but the law doesn't see it as a problem.\n\nNext, the social and ethical aspects. The age difference is significant, which can lead to issues because of the potential power imbalance. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18. Even though both are adults, the maturity levels might differ. The author is concerned about their friend's well-being because he's been lonely and might not realize the challenges in such a relationship. But is it the author's place to interfere? The friend is an adult and capable of making his own decisions, even if they're unwise.\n\nThe author took direct action by talking to the girl and discouraging the relationship. That could be seen as overstepping. The girl didn't take the advice seriously, which shows she's making her own choices. The author's intentions might be good, but meddling in the relationship without the friend's consent could be manipulative. Friends can offer advice, but not everyone is responsible for others' romantic choices. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend is awkward and has never had much luck with girls. This might mean he's desperate, but that doesn't justify the author's interference. The key point here is autonomy. Both individuals are adults and should have the right to choose their partners, regardless of others' opinions.\n\nHowever, the author's concern about the girl's maturity could have merit. If the girl isn't emotionally mature, the relationship might not be healthy. But the author isn't the one to decide that; it's up to both individuals to assess each other. The author's actions could be seen as controlling, trying to control the friend's romantic life under the guise of concern.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions are likely to protect their friend, they are not in the right because they're interfering in the friend's personal decisions. The friend is an adult and should be free to choose his partner unless there's actual harm involved. The author's actions cross the line from concern to manipulation.\n"
