He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. The author's friend has had trouble with relationships and is now interested in this younger girl. The author and another friend are actively trying to stop them, citing the age difference and the girl looking younger than 18.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so if the girl is 18, it's technically legal. But the author mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, implying maybe the girl turned 18 recently. So legally, it's okay now.\n\nThen there's the age difference. The friend is 31 and the girl is 18. Even though both are adults, a 13-year gap can be significant. However, age gaps are subjective. Some people are comfortable with larger gaps, while others aren't. The author's concern is that the girl looks younger, so there's a perception of immaturity. But that's a subjective judgment. The girl's actual maturity level isn't discussed, so we can't know for sure.\n\nThe author is intervening in their friend's personal life, which is a sensitive area. They've told the girl it's not a good idea and are trying to keep them apart. This could be seen as overstepping. The friend has the right to make his own romantic choices, even if others disagree. The author's actions might be based on their own discomfort rather than the girl's actual interest or the legality.\n\nAlso, the author mentions the friend is lonely and has struggled with relationships. The author's motivation might be to protect their friend from what they see as an unsuitable match, but it's possible the friend is genuinely interested in a relationship with this girl. The author is acting as a gatekeeper, which can be problematic.\n\nThere's also the question of consent and the girl's autonomy. The author spoke to her directly, but she responded with shyness, not anger. That might indicate she's not offended but unsure. The author's actions could be seen as dismissive of her agency to make her own decisions.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions might be to help, they are making decisions on behalf of both their friend and the girl. The situation involves personal choice and autonomy, which the author is interfering with. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for overstepping their role and not respecting the other person's right to make their own romantic choices.\n"
