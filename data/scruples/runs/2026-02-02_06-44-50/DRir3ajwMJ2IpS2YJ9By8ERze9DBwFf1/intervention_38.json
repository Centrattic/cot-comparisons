He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18. Legally, both are adults, so there's no criminal issue here. The author thinks she's too young, maybe because she looks younger or because of the age gap. The author has tried to discourage both the friend and the girl from getting together.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: consent is crucial here. Since both are adults, they can make their own choices unless there's some specific legal restriction. The author's actions involve trying to prevent a relationship that is legally permissible. The friend is being advised not to date someone he's interested in, and the girl was told it's not a good idea. The author might be acting out of concern, but are they overstepping?\n\nAge differences can be controversial, but in many places, there's no upper age limit for someone to date a legal adult. The author's justification is that the girl might look younger and there's a significant age gap, but that's subjective. The author's actions include actively trying to keep them apart, which might be interfering with the autonomy of both individuals.\n\nThe friend is feeling lonely and has been struggling with relationships. The author's intervention might be based on their own discomfort with the age difference rather than the friend's best interests. Also, the girl's response was to laugh shyly, which suggests she might not take the advice seriously, but the author continues to push.\n\nAnother angle is that the author is acting as a gatekeeper, deciding who their friend can or cannot date. That's a common issue in friendships where one person takes it upon themselves to control another's personal life. Unless there's a clear harm or illegal activity, it's usually up to the individuals involved to make their own decisions.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author is not in the wrong legally, but ethically, they might be overstepping. The question is whether the author has the right to intervene in this way. Since both parties are adults and the relationship is legal, the author's actions could be seen as intrusive and disrespectful of their autonomy. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
