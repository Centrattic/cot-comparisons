He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. So first, I need to consider the legal aspects. Both are adults, so legally there's no issue. But the author feels uncomfortable because the girl looks younger and the age difference feels significant.\n\nNow, age of consent isn't the problem here since both are over 18. But the author is worried about the maturity gap. The girl is only a few months away from being 18, which might make her less mature. The question is whether the author has the right to interfere. \n\nThe author says they've tried to discourage both the friend and the girl. But the friend is an adult, so he can choose who he dates. The author is acting as a friend, but maybe overstepping. They even mention trying to find ways to keep them apart, which could be manipulative. \n\nAlso, the author's motives: the friend's loneliness and past failures might make the author want to protect him, but that doesn't justify interfering. The friend is capable of making his own decisions. Unless there's evidence of harm or manipulation, the author isn't in the right to intervene. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're interfering in the autonomy of two adults who can make their own choices, even if the author disapproves.\n"
