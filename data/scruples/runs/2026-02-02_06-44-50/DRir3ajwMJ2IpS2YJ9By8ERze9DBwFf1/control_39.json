He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. The friend is lonely and hasn't had luck with girls before. The author thinks the girl is too young, even though they're both adults. The girl might look younger, but legally it's allowed now. The author is trying to stop the relationship by talking to both parties.\n\nHmm, the first thing I need to consider is the legal aspect. In many places, the age of consent is 18, so if the girl is 18, it's legal for them to date. The author mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, implying that maybe the girl turned 18 recently. So legally, there's no issue. But the author is worried about the age difference. However, the law is clear here.\n\nNext, the author's motivation. They're concerned for their friend's well-being, thinking maybe the girl isn't mature enough. But does that give them the right to interfere? The friend is an adult and can make his own decisions. The author is trying to control the situation, which might not be their place. Even if the author has good intentions, they're not the one making the decisions for their friend or the girl.\n\nAlso, the girl seems to show genuine interest, even if it's not clear if it's romantic. The author told her it wouldn't be a good idea and she laughed shyly. Maybe she's just being polite or doesn't see the issue. The author is imposing their own opinion without considering the girl's autonomy. She's an adult too and can decide her own relationships.\n\nThe friend is being discouraged by the author and another friend. The friend is feeling lonely and has been struggling with relationships. The author's actions might be preventing him from having a chance, even if the relationship isn't perfect. The author might be projecting their own views on what's appropriate, not considering that the friend might be happy with this relationship despite the age gap.\n\nBut wait, is there a power imbalance? The author is trying to prevent the relationship, but they're not in a position of authority. It's a personal decision between the two adults. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially if they're manipulating situations to keep them apart. The line between helping a friend and controlling their life is thin here.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is interfering in a legal and consensual adult relationship. While they have good intentions, they're not the ones who need to make the decision. The friends involved are adults capable of assessing their own relationships. The author's actions might stem from concern, but they're infringing on others' autonomy. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
