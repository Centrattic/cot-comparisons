He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is trying to stop their 31-year-old friend from getting involved with an 18-year-old girl. Both are adults, so legally, there's no issue. But the author feels it's inappropriate because the girl looks younger, and maybe the age difference is too big for them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, the age of consent is 18, so if the girl is 18 or older, it's legal. The author mentions that a few months ago it would be illegal, which suggests that maybe the girl is just a bit over 18 now. So legally, there's no problem.\n\nNext, the social and emotional aspects. The author's friend is mature enough to make his own decisions. Even though the author is concerned about the age gap, the friend is an adult. The author might be overstepping by trying to control his friend's relationships. The girl is also an adult, so she can make her own choices too. The author's actions\u2014like talking to the girl directly and trying to keep them apart\u2014might be considered interfering without a valid reason.\n\nAnother angle is the author's motivation. They mention that the friend has had trouble with relationships and is lonely. The author might be acting out of concern, but that doesn't justify manipulating the situation. Friends can offer advice, but forcing them to stay apart is different.\n\nAlso, the author judges the girl's maturity based on her appearance, which isn't fair. The girl's actual maturity level isn't discussed, just her looks. Assuming she's not mature enough because she looks younger is a stereotype.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions might be good, they're not in the right to control their friend's decisions. Adults should be allowed to choose their partners, and the author's interference could harm the friend's autonomy. So the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
