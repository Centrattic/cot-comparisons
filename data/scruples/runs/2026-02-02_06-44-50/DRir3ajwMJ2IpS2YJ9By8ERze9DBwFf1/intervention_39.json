He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from getting together with an 18-year-old. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the main points: the friend is 31, the girl is 18. The author and another friend are trying to stop them from dating. The girl seems interested but the author thinks she's too young and it's creepy. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider legal aspects first. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18. If both are adults, even if there's a significant age gap, it's legally okay. The author mentions that a few months ago it would be illegal, so maybe there's a state or jurisdiction where the age difference matters. But if it's now legal, then the relationship isn't illegal. However, age of consent laws do vary, so maybe the author is in a place where the legal age is different. But even if it's legal, the ethical side is another matter.\n\nNext, age difference. 31 and 18 is a 13-year gap. That's a big difference, but both are adults. There's no law against that. The author's reasoning is based on the girl looking younger, maybe like 16. The author thinks it's creepy, but that's a subjective feeling. The key here is that the girl is of legal age, so the author has no legal standing to prevent it. But the author is acting as a friend, so maybe they feel protective. However, the girl is an adult, so she can make her own decisions.\n\nThe author's actions: they told the girl outright it wouldn't be a good idea, and tried to discourage the friend. The friend is feeling lonely, which the author acknowledges. Is it the author's place to interfere? Maybe the author is overstepping by making decisions for both their friend and the girl, especially if the girl isn't being coerced or harmed. The girl's response was shy laughter, so maybe she's not entirely against it, but the author is still trying to stop it.\n\nAnother angle: the author's friend has had trouble with girls and is lonely. The author might be acting out of concern, but the solution is to interfere rather than help the friend build better relationships. The author's approach could be seen as controlling or not respecting the autonomy of both the friend and the girl. Even if the author's intentions are good, they're not the ones in the relationship, so they can't decide for others.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is stepping over the line by trying to prevent a legal and consensual relationship between two adults. Even if they have concerns about maturity or power dynamics, it's not their place to make that decision. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
