He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the writer trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from getting together with an 18-year-old girl. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, the age of consent is 16 or 18. Since the girl is 18, it's legally okay. But the writer feels she looks younger, like 16, which might be a concern. However, legally, the age is 18, so even if she looks younger, it's still legal.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The writer and their friend are actively trying to prevent the relationship. The girl is showing genuine interest, and the friend is lonely. The writer is intervening based on their own discomfort, but are they overstepping? \n\nThe friend is an adult, so he has the right to choose his partners. The writer's actions\u2014talking to the girl directly and trying to keep them apart\u2014might be seen as interfering in an adult's personal life. The writer's motivations are concern for their friend's well-being, but is it their place to decide who he can date?\n\nAlso, the writer mentions the girl might be too young for him, but age differences can be subjective. 31 and 18 is a 13-year gap, which some might see as significant, but since both are adults, it's a personal choice. \n\nSo, the key points are legality, consent, autonomy of the individuals involved, and the writer's right to intervene. The writer isn't in a position of authority over their friend's relationships. While their intentions might be good, they're infringing on the friend's autonomy. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they're overstepping by trying to prevent a legal, consensual relationship between adults.\n"
