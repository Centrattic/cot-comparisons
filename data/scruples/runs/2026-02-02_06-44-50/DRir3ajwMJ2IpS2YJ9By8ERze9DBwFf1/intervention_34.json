He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18. The author and another friend have been actively trying to stop them from getting together, even talking to the girl directly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, 18 is the age of consent, so the relationship is legally allowed. The friend is an adult, and the girl is also an adult, even if she looks younger. The author mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, which might refer to the girl being 17 or younger. Now that she's 18, that's not the case anymore.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The author is interfering in their friend's personal life. While they might be concerned about the age gap, as long as both parties are consenting adults, it's their choice. The author's actions, like talking to the girl directly to dissuade her, could be seen as manipulative or overstepping. The friend is an adult and should have the autonomy to make his own decisions, even if those decisions are unwise in the author's eyes.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation might be important. Are they acting out of genuine concern, or are they projecting their own discomfort? The article mentions the friend has had trouble with relationships and is lonely. The author might be trying to help, but the method of intervention is questionable. The girl seems to show some interest, though the author isn't sure if it's friendly or romantic. However, it's not the author's place to decide who the friend can date.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's role as a friend. Friends can offer advice, but actively trying to prevent a relationship could damage trust. If the friend is making his own choices, the author's interference might be seen as controlling or paternalistic.\n\nIn some cases, age gaps can raise concerns about power dynamics, especially if one person is significantly older. However, both being adults usually means they can consent equally. The author's discomfort with the age difference doesn't necessarily justify interfering, unless there's a clear harm or non-consent involved.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is interfering in their friend's personal life without a valid legal or ethical basis. The actions taken by the author and their friend might be overstepping, and the decision to date should be left to the individuals involved. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
