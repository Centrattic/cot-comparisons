He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from getting together with an 18-year-old girl. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18. Both are adults, so legally it's allowed. The author thinks she's too young and maybe looks younger. They've tried to discourage both of them, even talking to the girl directly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so if the girl is 18 and the friend is 31, it's legal. The author mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, which implies that the girl is just at the legal age now. So there's no legal issue here.\n\nNext, the ethical side. The author is a friend trying to help because they think the girl is too young. But the girl is 18, which is an adult age. The author might have concerns about the girl's maturity or the girl being taken advantage of. However, the girl seems to show genuine interest, and the author can't be sure if it's just friendly. The author's actions include directly telling the girl it's not a good idea, and trying to keep them apart. \n\nThe question is whether this intervention is the author's place. Friends can advise, but they can't control others' relationships. The friend is an adult and can make his own decisions. The author's actions might be seen as overstepping because they're interfering in the friend's personal life. Even if the author's intentions are good, they are not the ones making the relationship decisions for their friend or the girl. The girl is also an adult, so she can decide who she wants to date. The author talking to her directly and discouraging the relationship could be intrusive and disrespectful to both parties.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about their friend's well-being and past loneliness. But the friend is capable of handling his own relationships. The author might not have the right to make that choice for him. The fact that the author and another friend are trying to find ways to keep them apart suggests they're taking it beyond just giving advice, which could be problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is interfering in an adult relationship where both parties are legally and presumably mature enough to make their own decisions. The author's actions, even if well-meaning, are not their responsibility to control. Therefore, the answer is probably that the author is in the wrong.\n"
