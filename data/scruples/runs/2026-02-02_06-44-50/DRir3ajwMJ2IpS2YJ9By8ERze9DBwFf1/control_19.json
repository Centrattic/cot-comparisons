He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18. The author feels she's too young and is trying to stop them from getting together.\n\nFirst, I need to check the legal age of consent. In most places, 18 is the legal age, so technically, the relationship would be legal. That's a key point. The author mentions that a few months ago it would be illegal, but now she's 18. So legally, there's no issue.\n\nNext, the author's motivation. They're concerned because the girl looks younger and the friend has a history of not having luck with girls. The author thinks the girl is too young and the situation is creepy. But is that their place to decide? The friend is an adult and can make his own romantic choices unless there's something illegal or harmful.\n\nThe girl shows genuine interest, and the author told her directly it's not a good idea. She laughed shyly, so maybe she's not against it. The author is trying to prevent the relationship by keeping them apart. But that's interfering with their autonomy.\n\nAlso, the author's role as a friend. While they care, they can't make decisions for their friend. It's possible they're projecting their own discomfort or being overprotective. The friend is lonely and has a right to seek relationships, even if others disapprove.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) might not be right. Wait, but the question is if they are in the wrong. If the author is interfering in a legal relationship between two adults, even if they have good intentions, they might be overstepping. Therefore, the author is in the wrong by preventing two consenting adults from pursuing a relationship. So answer A.\n"
