He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. So first, I need to consider the legal aspects. The girl is 18, which is the legal age of consent in most places, so there's no legal issue here. The author mentions that just a few months ago it would have been illegal, but now it's not. So legally, there's no problem.\n\nNext, the ethical side. The author is intervening because they think the girl is too young and looks younger. But age is a number, and both parties are adults. The girl seems to show genuine interest, even if it's not clear if it's romantic. The author's actions include directly telling the girl it's a bad idea and trying to keep the two apart. That might be crossing a line because they're making decisions for their friend and the girl without considering their autonomy. \n\nAlso, the author's friend is lonely and hasn't had much luck with relationships. By discouraging him, the author might be denying him a chance at a relationship he's interested in, even if it's not perfect. The author's other friend is involved, so it's a group effort, but that doesn't make it right. \n\nThere's also the aspect of consent and maturity. If the girl is 18 and capable of making her own decisions, the author has no right to tell her who she can date. The fact that the author finds it creepy might be their personal bias, but that shouldn't interfere with others' choices. \n\nHowever, the author might be concerned that the girl isn't mature enough, but that's an assumption. The key point is that both individuals are adults and can make their own decisions, and the author is overstepping by trying to control their friend's actions. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they're interfering in a relationship between two consenting adults without a valid legal or ethical reason.\n"
