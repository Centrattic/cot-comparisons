He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted this is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18.\n\nFirst, legally, both are adults. The age of consent here matters. Since the girl is 18, it's legal for them to date. The post mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, so I guess the girl just turned 18. But legally, there's no issue now. \n\nThe author is concerned about the age gap. The girl might look younger, but she's an adult. The author's justification is that the girl is \"way too young\" and they should date someone the same age. But that's subjective. Age gaps in relationships can be controversial, but as long as both parties are consenting adults, it's their choice. \n\nThe author is actively trying to prevent the relationship by talking to both the friend and the girl. They even told the girl it's not a good idea, and the girl laughed shyly. The friend is feeling lonely and the author is trying to keep them apart. \n\nThe key points here are consent and autonomy. The author is interfering in a potential relationship between two adults without a legal or ethical justification. The author's actions could be seen as controlling or overstepping. The friend is an adult and can make his own decisions. The author might have valid concerns about the girl's maturity or the age gap, but it's not their place to prevent the relationship unless there's harm involved. \n\nAlso, the author mentions the friend has had trouble with relationships before. Maybe the author is worried about the friend getting hurt, but that doesn't justify intervening without consent. It's possible the author is projecting their own discomfort with age gaps onto the situation. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is likely in the wrong. They're interfering in a consensual adult relationship without a legitimate reason. The right to form relationships is a personal choice, and as long as both parties are adults, others shouldn't prevent it unless there's abuse or coercion. Since the post doesn't indicate that, the answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
