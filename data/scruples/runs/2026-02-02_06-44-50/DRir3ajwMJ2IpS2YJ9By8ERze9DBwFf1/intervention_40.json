He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. The author's main concerns are the age gap and the girl's apparent maturity level, even though both are legally adults.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, the age of consent is 18, so the relationship would be legal. However, the author feels that the girl looks younger, which might be a personal concern rather than a legal one. The author mentions that just a few months ago, the relationship would have been illegal, which suggests the girl is right at the legal age now. \n\nNext, the author is interfering by talking to the girl directly and trying to keep them apart. This raises ethical questions about consent and autonomy. The friends involved are making decisions for their friend and the girl, which might not be their place. The girl seems interested, so the author's interference could be seen as overstepping.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation is partly based on their own discomfort with the age difference. The friend's loneliness and lack of past success in relationships are mentioned, but the author is projecting their own preferences onto their friend. It's not their role to dictate whom their friend can date, even if they disagree with the choice.\n\nAnother point is the girl's perspective. If she's 18 and legally an adult, she should have the autonomy to choose her partners. The author's actions could be seen as paternalistic, assuming they know what's best for her without her consent. The girl laughed shyly when the author warned her, which might indicate she's not entirely against the idea, but the author persists in trying to stop it.\n\nIn relationships, the key factors are mutual consent and legality. Since both parties are adults and the relationship is legal, the author's interference might not be justified. The friends are acting out of concern but overstepping their bounds. The right to personal relationships is a fundamental aspect of autonomy, and unless there's evidence of harm or coercion, the author has no right to intervene.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong for interfering in their friend's and the girl's personal decisions without valid reasons beyond their own discomfort with the age gap.\n"
