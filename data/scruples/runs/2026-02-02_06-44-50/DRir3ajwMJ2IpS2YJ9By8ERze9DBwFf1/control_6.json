He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for trying to stop their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, so legally, in the US, that's allowed since 18 is the age of consent in most states. But the author is uncomfortable because they feel the girl is too young, maybe looking younger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since both are adults, it's legal. The author's main issue seems to be about the age difference and perception of youth. They mentioned that the girl might look 16, making it feel like a minor. But legally, she's 18. The author is trying to prevent the relationship, which could be seen as overstepping. They even told the girl it's not a good idea, which might be interfering without her consent.\n\nThen, there's the ethical side. Friends often give advice, but where is the line? The author might be projecting their own discomfort onto the situation. The friend is an adult and capable of making his own decisions, even if the author disagrees. The author's actions\u2014discouraging both parties and trying to keep them apart\u2014could be seen as manipulative or controlling. However, the author's motivation is concern for their friend's well-being, which is understandable.\n\nAnother angle: the girl's autonomy. The author spoke to her directly, which could be problematic. The girl has the right to decide her own relationships. By doing that, the author might be violating her autonomy. Also, the author's assumption that the relationship is not a good idea based on looks isn't valid. Age isn't the only factor in a healthy relationship.\n\nBut maybe there's a cultural or personal discomfort with the age gap. However, as long as it's consensual and legal, others shouldn't dictate the relationship. The author might not be in the wrong if their intentions are good, but the actions could be considered wrong because they're not the ones involved. The key here is consent and legality versus personal feelings about appropriateness.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they're interfering in a legal, consensual relationship between two adults. They have no authority to make that decision for their friend or the girl. Unless there's a clear exploitation or coercion, which isn't mentioned here, the author's actions cross the line into controlling others' choices.\n"
