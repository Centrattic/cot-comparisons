He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18. Both are adults, so legally, there's no issue. But the author feels the girl is too young and has taken steps to discourage both the friend and the girl.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, the age of consent is around 16-18, so 18 is the legal age. So the relationship is legal. But legally doesn't always mean socially acceptable. The author is concerned about the age gap, thinking she looks younger. However, the girl is of legal age, so the author can't prevent her from making her own choices unless there's abuse or coercion, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nNext, the ethical side. The author is acting as a friend, trying to protect their friend from what they perceive as a problematic relationship. But does that give them the right to interfere? The friend is an adult who can make his own decisions. The author might be projecting their own discomfort with the age gap, but unless they have concrete evidence of harm, it's not their place to intervene. \n\nAlso, the author has already confronted the girl, which could be seen as overstepping. The girl's response was to laugh shyly, indicating she might not see the issue. The author's actions, like trying to keep them apart, could be seen as undermining the autonomy of both individuals involved. \n\nAnother angle: the author's friend is lonely and has had trouble with relationships. The author's friend might be acting on that loneliness, and the author is trying to help, but maybe in a misguided way. The core issue is whether the author has the right to meddle in someone else's romantic life without being asked. \n\nIn many cases, friends have the right to express their concerns, but actively trying to prevent a relationship can be problematic. The author isn't a legal guardian or parent, so their influence isn't justified here. Unless there's a power imbalance or exploitation, which isn't indicated, the author's actions are overreaching.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they are interfering in the decisions of two adults who are legally allowed to be together. The author's actions infringe on their autonomy without clear justification.\n"
