He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from getting together with an 18-year-old girl. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, legal age of consent is a factor. In many places, 18 is the legal age, so technically they're both adults. But the author feels uncomfortable because the girl looks much younger and was underage just months ago. That might trigger some personal discomfort, but legally, there's no issue.\n\nThe author's friend is struggling with relationships and this girl seems interested. The author is intervening by talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart. But the girl is 18, so it's her choice. The author is overstepping by directly advising her against it and trying to prevent the relationship. \n\nThe author's motivation seems to be concern for their friend's well-being, maybe thinking he's being taken advantage of or that the relationship is inappropriate. However, the friend is an adult and capable of making his own decisions. The author has no authority to interfere in someone else's romantic choices unless there's abuse or coercion, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nAlso, the author is using personal judgment based on appearance (thinking the girl looks 16) which can be problematic. Age is what's on the documents, not how someone looks. Assuming the girl is too young because of her appearance is a stereotype.\n\nSo, even though the author has good intentions, they're violating the autonomy of both their friend and the girl. They shouldn't be making decisions for adults in a consensual relationship. The correct answer here is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
