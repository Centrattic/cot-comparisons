He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. So first, the main points here: the friend is 31, the girl is 18, legally adults, but the author thinks she looks 16. The author and another friend are actively trying to keep them apart.\n\nHmm. Well, legally, in most places, 18 is the age of consent, so the relationship isn't illegal. But the author is worried about the age gap and the girl's maturity. They mentioned that the girl might be too young-looking, even though she's 18. But legally, it's allowed. Now, whether it's morally wrong is a different question. The author's intentions might be to protect their friend, thinking he might be taken advantage of or that the relationship isn't healthy. But the author is interfering without the friend's consent, which could be problematic. The friend is an adult, so he can make his own decisions, even if others disagree. The author's actions could be seen as controlling or overstepping, especially if they're actively trying to prevent the relationship. However, if the author genuinely believes the girl isn't a good match, maybe they're acting out of concern. But since both are adults, the author isn't in the right to interfere. The answer might be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to be careful. Wait, but in some contexts, even if legal, there's a social stigma or concern about power dynamics. However, the key here is that the author is a third party trying to meddle. The friend is an adult, so the author shouldn't dictate who he can date. Unless there's evidence of harm, which the author hasn't provided. So maybe the author is in the wrong by interfering. Wait, but the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the author is concerned, but the friend is an adult, the author shouldn't meddle. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). Wait, conflicting thoughts here. Let me check again. The author is not the parent or guardian; they can't impose their will on their friend. The friend is capable of making his own choices, even if others don't agree. So trying to prevent the relationship without the friend's consent is overstepping. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
