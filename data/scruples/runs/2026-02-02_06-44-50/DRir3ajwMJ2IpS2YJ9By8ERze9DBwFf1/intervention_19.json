He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The author's friend is 31, and the girl is 18. The key points here are the age difference, whether the author has the right to interfere, and the legality.\n\nFirst, both individuals are adults. Legally, in many places, 18 is the age of consent, so the relationship isn't illegal. The author mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, but since the girl is now 18, it's technically allowed. So maybe the author is overstepping by using legality as a concern.\n\nThe author is acting on their own judgment about what's appropriate, but the decision to date is between the two adults. It's possible the author is projecting their discomfort or personal preferences as a moral issue. The friend is an adult too, and while he's been lonely and awkward, he has the right to choose his partners. The author's actions\u2014like talking to the girl directly and trying to keep them apart\u2014could be seen as meddling in the friend's personal life without his consent.\n\nAnother angle: the author might be trying to protect their friend from potential regret or a bad situation. However, unless there's evidence of coercion or harm, it's a personal choice. The girl's interest is also mentioned as genuine, so the author's interference could be unwarranted.\n\nIn terms of ethics, adults have autonomy in their romantic choices. The author's actions might be crossing a line by making decisions for their friend and the girl. Unless there's a clear danger, it's not their place to intervene. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
