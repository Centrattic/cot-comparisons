He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's 31-year-old friend is interested in an 18-year-old girl. The author and another friend are trying to stop them from getting together. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, depending on the location. Since the girl is 18, it's legal for the 31-year-old to date her. So legally, there's no issue. But maybe there's a social or ethical concern.\n\nThe author is worried that the girl looks much younger, maybe like a 16-year-old. But her actual age is 18, so legally, that's okay. However, age differences can raise concerns about power dynamics or maturity levels. An 18-year-old is just starting adulthood, while the friend is 31, which is a significant gap. The author might feel that the girl isn't mature enough for a serious relationship with someone much older.\n\nBut is it the author's place to intervene? The author is trying to prevent their friend from pursuing the relationship. They even told the girl it wouldn't be a good idea. The girl laughed shyly, so maybe she's not receptive. The friend is lonely, which the author acknowledges. The author's intentions might be good\u2014concerned about their friend's well-being and the girl's. But does that give them the right to interfere?\n\nIn terms of personal relationships, people have the right to choose their partners unless there's harm involved. The author isn't in a position to decide who their friend dates. Even if the author thinks the relationship is a bad idea, unless the girl is a minor or there's some form of coercion, it's not their business. The author might be overstepping by actively trying to keep them apart and talking to the girl directly.\n\nAnother angle: the author's friend is an adult and capable of making his own decisions. The author's actions could be seen as controlling or paternalistic. The girl is also an adult and should be able to decide who she's interested in. The author's interference could harm their friendship and the girl's autonomy.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the author's intentions might be to protect their friend, they are not in a position to make that decision for him or the girl. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by interfering in a legally and socially permissible relationship.\n"
