He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so if the girl is 18 and the guy is 31, it's technically legal. The author mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, which makes me think maybe the girl turned 18 recently. So legally, there's no issue here.\n\nNext, the social and ethical angle. The age difference is 13 years. Some people might see that as a big gap, but since they're both adults, it's their choice. The author is concerned about the girl acting younger than her age, but age is a number, and maturity varies. The author's friend has had a hard time with relationships and is finally showing interest in someone. The author is intervening, possibly out of concern, but maybe overstepping.\n\nThe author directly told the girl it wouldn't be a good idea and is trying to keep them apart. That could be seen as meddling in their personal lives. Friends can offer advice, but it's not their place to control who their friend dates unless there's abuse or harm involved. The author's actions might be based on personal discomfort rather than actual harm.\n\nAlso, the girl seems to have some interest, even if it's not clear. The author is assuming the worst, which might not be fair. The main issue is whether the author has the right to interfere when the relationship is consensual and legal. So, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong because they're overstepping by trying to control their friend's decisions.\n"
