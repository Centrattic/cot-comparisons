He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's 31-year-old friend is interested in an 18-year-old girl, and the author is trying to stop them from getting together. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so in this case, if the girl is 18, then legally it's okay because both are adults. But the author mentions that the girl looks younger, maybe like 16, and that just a few months ago it would have been illegal. So maybe the author is worried that the girl might not be mature enough, even though she's 18. But legally, it's a gray area only if the girl is underage. Since she's 18, it's not illegal. \n\nNext, the social aspect. There's a significant age gap between 31 and 18, which is 13 years. Age gaps in relationships can be controversial, but both parties are adults. The author is concerned about the girl's maturity and the power dynamic. However, the girl seems to show genuine interest, and the friend is feeling lonely. The author's actions include directly telling the girl it's a bad idea and trying to keep them apart with another friend. \n\nIs the author overstepping? Well, the author isn't in a position to make decisions for either the friend or the girl. Even if the author thinks the relationship is a bad idea, as long as both parties are consenting adults, it's their choice. The author might have good intentions, like protecting their friend from potential regret or the girl from an older partner, but intervening by discouraging the girl and trying to prevent the relationship could be seen as controlling. \n\nAlso, the friend's loneliness and lack of past success with women might mean he's desperate, but that's his personal situation. The author's approach could be undermining their friend's autonomy. The girl's reaction was to laugh shyly, which might indicate she's not taking the advice seriously. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong legally, but ethically, there's a debate. However, the key point is that both are adults, and the author doesn't have the right to interfere in their personal choices. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), but I need to check if there's any other angle. Maybe if there's a power imbalance or if the girl is being manipulated, but the scenario doesn't suggest that. The friend is making the moves, not the girl. The author's actions might be well-meaning but inappropriate. So, the answer is B.\n"
