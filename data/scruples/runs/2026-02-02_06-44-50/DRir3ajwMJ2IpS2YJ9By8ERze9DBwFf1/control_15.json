He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a 31-year-old friend is getting closer to an 18-year-old girl, and the author, along with another friend, is trying to prevent them from dating. The main question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so if the girl is 18, then technically it's legal for them to date. However, the author mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, which might mean that if the girl had been under 18, it would have been a problem. Now that she's 18, it's legal. So legally, there's no issue here. The author might be worried about the power dynamic or the maturity gap.\n\nNext, the social and ethical considerations. The age difference is 13 years. While both are adults, some people might feel that a significant age gap could lead to issues, especially if one is more mature than the other. The author thinks the girl looks younger, maybe 16, which could affect their perception. However, the girl is 18, so it's legal. The author's concern might stem from the idea that the girl is inexperienced or not emotionally ready for a relationship with someone much older. But that's speculative. The author is assuming the girl's intentions and maturity level without knowing her perspective.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the author's actions. They've directly told the girl it's not a good idea, and they're trying to keep the two apart. That could be seen as overstepping, especially if the author isn't in a position to dictate other people's relationships. The friend might have the right to pursue a relationship if both parties are consenting adults. The author is acting out of concern, but does that justify interfering in someone else's personal life?\n\nAlso, the friend in question hasn't had much luck with relationships and is feeling lonely. The author is trying to help, but maybe they're projecting their own discomfort with age gaps rather than respecting his autonomy. The line between helping and controlling can be blurry here. If the girl is genuinely interested and the relationship is consensual, the author's intervention might be unwarranted.\n\nAnother angle is the author's judgment about the girl looking younger. It's possible that the author is making assumptions based on appearance rather than actual maturity. The girl might be perfectly capable and mature for her age. The author's actions could be based on stereotypes about young women and their readiness for relationships.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions are to protect their friend, they might be overstepping by interfering in a legal and consensual relationship. The decision should ultimately be up to both individuals involved. The author's actions could be seen as disrespectful to both their friend and the girl, as they're making decisions on their behalf. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
