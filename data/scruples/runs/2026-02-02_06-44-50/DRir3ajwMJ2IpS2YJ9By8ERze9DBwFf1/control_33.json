He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author is trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from getting together with an 18-year-old girl. The friend has had trouble with relationships, and the girl is just turning 18, which is legal, but the author feels she's too young and is trying to stop them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, 18 is the age of consent, so it's legal for them to date. The author mentions that a few months ago it would be illegal, but now it's not. So legally, the friend is within his rights. \n\nThen, there's the ethical angle. The author and another friend are actively trying to prevent the relationship by talking to the girl and discouraging the friend. The question is whether this is justified. The author's concern is that the girl might look younger and there's a significant age gap. But even so, both are adults. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially if the girl is interested and the friend is trying to pursue her. \n\nAnother point is the author's motives. They might be acting out of genuine concern for their friend's well-being, assuming that a younger partner might not be a good match. However, they're making assumptions about the girl's intentions and the relationship's nature. The girl might be mature for her age, and the friend is an adult who can make his own decisions. \n\nInterfering in someone's romantic choices can be a boundary issue. The author is taking it upon themselves to control their friend's actions, which might not be their place. Unless there's concrete evidence of the girl being manipulative or the relationship being harmful, the author's actions could be considered meddling. \n\nOn the other hand, if there's a history of the friend being taken advantage of or the author has specific reasons to believe the girl isn't a good match, maybe there's some justification. But the post doesn't mention any such red flags. The author's main concern is the age difference, which, while significant, isn't illegal. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they're intervening in their friend's personal life without clear justification, potentially infringing on the friend's autonomy. The answer would be B (No), meaning the author is not in the wrong? Wait, no. Wait, if the author is overstepping, then they would be in the wrong. The answer would be A (Yes). Wait, the options are A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No. So, if the author is wrong, answer A. \n\nBut I need to be careful. The key points are legality, consent, and autonomy. The author's actions are preventing two consenting adults from pursuing a relationship, which is their right. Unless there's harm, the author's interference is problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
