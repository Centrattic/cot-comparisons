He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's 31-year-old friend is interested in a 18-year-old girl. The author and another friend are trying to prevent them from getting together. The main argument is that while both are technically adults, the girl looks much younger, like 16, and the author feels it's inappropriate because just a few months ago it would have been illegal (since 18 is the age of consent in many places). The author is concerned about the age gap and the girl's maturity level.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspect: if the girl is 18, then in most places, a relationship between a 31-year-old and an 18-year-old is legal. The author mentions that just months ago it would have been illegal, implying that the girl's age was below the legal age then, but now it's okay. So legally, there's no issue now. But the author is still uncomfortable because of the perceived immaturity and the significant age gap.\n\nEthically, this is trickier. The author is trying to interfere in the relationship, even going so far as to talk to the girl directly and trying to keep them apart. The key question is whether the author has the right to do this. The author's friend is an adult and has the right to make his own romantic choices, even if the author disagrees. However, if the author believes the girl is being taken advantage of or isn't mature enough, maybe there's a concern about consent or power dynamics.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is based on their own discomfort and the perception that the girl looks too young. They don't present evidence that the girl is being coerced or that the relationship is harmful. The girl seems to show genuine interest, so maybe she's willing and capable of making her own decisions. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping by not respecting their friend's autonomy. Unless there's clear harm, it's not the author's place to dictate their friend's relationships, even if they disagree.\n\nSo, the author is trying to prevent a legal and consensual relationship based on personal feelings. That could be seen as wrong because they're interfering without valid grounds. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
