He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, so the age difference is 13 years. The author thinks the girl is too young, maybe acting like she's 16, and is worried because it's close to the legal age limit in some places.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18. If the girl is 18, then it's legal, but maybe in some states or countries, the age of consent is higher. However, the user mentioned that a few months ago it would have been illegal, implying that now it's just legal. So legally, it's okay.\n\nNext, the ethical side. The author is interfering in their friend's personal life. Even if the author thinks the relationship is inappropriate, they don't have the authority to prevent adults from entering a consensual relationship. The friend is an adult and can make his own decisions. The author is acting as a gatekeeper, which might not be their role. \n\nAlso, the author is being judgmental. The girl shows genuine interest, and the friend is trying to approach her. The author's main issue seems to be about age, but since both are adults, it's their choice. The author's actions, like talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart, could be seen as overstepping. \n\nAnother point: the author is trying to influence another friend to help, which adds to the pressure. The friend might feel lonely, and the author is dismissing his needs by not supporting his choice in partners. \n\nBut there's also the concern that the girl might be immature. However, assuming she's 18 and acting younger doesn't automatically mean she's not capable of a mature relationship. It's possible, but the author is making an assumption. Still, the decision to date is the friend's to make.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is overstepping by trying to control their friend's romantic life. Even if their intentions are to protect their friend, they don't have the right to interfere in consensual adult relationships. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
