He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, both the friend and the girl are legally adults. The age of consent in many places is 18, so technically, their relationship is legal. The author is concerned about the age difference, thinking the girl looks younger, and that the friend is just seeking a relationship because he's been lonely. The author and another friend have tried to intervene by discouraging both parties, even going as far as trying to keep them apart.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, there's no issue since both are adults. But socially, there might be some concerns. Age gaps can be a sensitive topic, especially when one person is significantly older. However, the author's actions here are about trying to prevent a relationship that's legal and consensual. \n\nI need to consider if the author has the right to interfere in their friend's romantic choices. Friends often give advice, but when does that advice cross into controlling behavior? The author is actively trying to stop the relationship, not just suggesting caution. They even told the girl it wouldn't be a good idea, which could be seen as meddling. \n\nThe key points are consent, legality, and the right to personal relationships. Since the author isn't a parent or legal guardian, they don't have the authority to dictate their friend's romantic decisions. The friend is an adult and capable of making his own choices, even if others disagree. The author's actions might stem from concern, but it's not their place to prevent a legal and consensual relationship. \n\nAnother angle is that the author might be projecting their own discomfort with the age gap. The friend's loneliness and the girl's interest could be valid reasons for him to pursue a relationship. The author's intervention could harm their friendship if the friend feels betrayed. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might be to protect their friend, they don't have the right to interfere in a legal and consensual relationship. The answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
