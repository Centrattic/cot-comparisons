He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. The friend is 31, the girl is 18, which is legal in some places but the writer feels it's too young. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so if it's 18, then technically it's legal. But the writer feels the girl looks younger, like 16, which might be a concern. However, age is just a number, and as long as both are adults, it's their choice. The writer is intervening by talking to both parties and trying to keep them apart. \n\nNext, personal boundaries. The author is a friend, so they might think they're helping. But is it their place to control another person's relationships? Even if the author has good intentions, interfering in someone's personal life, especially a friend's, could be seen as overstepping. The friend is an adult and should make his own decisions. The author's actions might be driven by their own discomfort rather than the friend's best interest. \n\nThe girl is 18, so she's an adult. The author talked to her directly and she responded shyly, maybe not taking it seriously. The author's actions could be seen as manipulative, trying to influence the girl's choice. Also, the author is using another friend to help, which might not be ethical. \n\nThe friend is lonely and has had trouble with relationships. The author's intervention might be stemming from a place of wanting to protect the friend but could be causing more harm by denying him a potential relationship. The author's judgment based on appearance (thinking she looks 16) is subjective and not a valid reason to interfere. \n\nSo putting it all together: The author is not the one in the wrong because the relationship is legal and the choice of partner is up to the friends involved. The author's actions are overstepping and not respecting their autonomy. Therefore, answer A.\n"
