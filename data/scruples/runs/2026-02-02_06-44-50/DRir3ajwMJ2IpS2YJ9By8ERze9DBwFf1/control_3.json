He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. The girl is 18, which is the age of consent in many places, so there's no legal issue here. Even though the user mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, now it's legal. So that part isn't a problem.\n\nNext, the age difference. 31 and 18 is a 13-year gap. Some might see this as a significant difference, but both are adults. It's their choice unless there's a power imbalance or manipulation. The user is the friend, so they're trying to influence their friend's decisions. But the friend is an adult, so he has the right to make his own choices.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that the girl looks younger and seems like a 16-year-old. But that's subjective. Appearance doesn't define maturity. Also, the user is projecting their own discomfort, saying it \"creeps them out.\" Personal feelings shouldn't dictate others' relationships unless there's harm involved.\n\nThe other friend and the user are actively trying to keep them apart. That's where it gets tricky. If the friend is being pressured not to pursue this, even though he's willing and the girl seems interested, that could be overstepping. The friend might need support, not interference.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the situation involves two adults making their own choices, and the author is interfering based on personal discomfort, it's likely the author is overstepping. Unless there's evidence of harm or coercion, the author shouldn't dictate the friend's romantic choices. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
