He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the writer trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so if it's 18, then technically the relationship is legal. The writer mentions that just a couple of months ago it would have been illegal, which makes me think maybe the girl turned 18 recently. So legality isn't an issue here, which might take away one argument against the relationship.\n\nThen there's the age difference. 31 and 18 is a 13-year gap. While both are adults, the writer feels it's a big difference and the girl looks younger. The writer is concerned about the maturity levels. But the girl is showing genuine interest, and the friend is lonely. The writer is interfering by talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart.\n\nThe writer's intentions might be to protect their friend and the girl. But is it their place to do so? Friends can have concerns, but the friend is an adult and can make his own decisions. The writer is trying to control the situation without the friend's consent, which might be overstepping. They are acting without the friend's agreement, which could be seen as manipulative or controlling.\n\nAlso, the writer is making assumptions about the girl's interest and the girl's maturity. They said the girl \"might as well be 16,\" which is judgmental. The girl's own feelings and maturity level aren't being considered here. The writer is imposing their own standards without knowing the girl's perspective.\n\nAnother angle: the writer is friends with the 31-year-old and might be projecting their own opinions or societal norms. They might not realize that relationships with age gaps can work if both parties are consenting adults. The key point is that both individuals are adults and capable of making their own choices, even if others disapprove.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the writer isn't the parent or guardian of either person. Their role as a friend is to support and offer advice, but not to prevent a relationship unless there's actual harm involved. The writer is taking it a step further by involving another friend to keep them apart, which is a form of intervention without consent.\n\nSo putting it all together, the writer is interfering in a situation that's none of their business. They're making assumptions about the girl and their friend's needs. While their concern might be genuine, the method of intervention is inappropriate. Therefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
