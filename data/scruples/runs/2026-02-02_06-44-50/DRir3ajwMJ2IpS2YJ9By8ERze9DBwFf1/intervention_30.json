He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. The friend has a history of not having luck with girls and is now interested in a girl who's just turned 18. The author and another friend are trying to stop them, arguing that the girl is too young and looks younger than her age.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so if the girl is 18, it's legal. But the author feels it's inappropriate because the girl looks younger. However, looks can be deceptive, and age is a legal factor, not a physical one. So maybe the author is overstepping by judging based on appearance.\n\nThen there's the issue of autonomy. The friends involved are adults, so they have the right to choose their partners. The author is interfering in their personal decisions without being asked. Even if they have good intentions, it's not their place to control others' relationships. The author's actions, like directly telling the girl it's a bad idea and trying to keep them apart, could be seen as manipulative or controlling.\n\nThe friend who is interested in the girl is feeling lonely and hasn't had success before. The author's friend might just want to support him, but the author is acting out of concern. However, the right to form relationships is a personal choice. The author might think they're helping, but they're not considering the autonomy of both friends.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the girl is \"technically\" an adult, which is correct. So legally, there's no issue. The problem might be societal or personal discomfort with the age gap. But unless there's a legal issue, the author's actions are interfering with personal choices. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's generally not acceptable to prevent others from entering into consensual relationships, even if you disagree with their choices. The author's approach could prevent their friend from finding happiness or a relationship, even if it's a bad idea. However, the author might be trying to protect their friend from potential regret or problems that can come with a significant age gap. But again, that's a personal choice to make, not one that others can enforce.\n\nSo, the key points are: legality (they're both adults), autonomy (they can choose their partners), and the ethics of interfering in personal relationships. The author is acting without being asked and is trying to control the situation, which is a breach of personal freedom. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
