He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for trying to stop their friend from dating an 18-year-old. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nThe friend is 31, and the girl is 18. Both are adults, so legally in most places, that's okay. The author is worried about the age difference, thinking the girl looks younger than 18, maybe even 16. They mention that just a few months ago, if the girl were younger, it would be illegal, but now she's 18, so it's legal. The author and another friend are actively trying to prevent the relationship, even talking to the girl directly about it. The friend is feeling lonely and has had trouble with relationships before.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspect. Since both are adults, the relationship is legal in most jurisdictions. The author's concern about the girl looking 16 is subjective; age is a number, and if she's 18, legally that's the main point. However, the author is worried about the power dynamic. A 31-year-old and an 18-year-old might have a significant life experience gap. The girl is still young, maybe in her first year of college or just starting out, while the friend is more mature. There's a risk of the older person taking advantage of the younger one, but the question is whether the author has the right to interfere.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author's friend has the right to choose his partners, provided there's mutual consent. The author is intervening without the girl's consent, which might be overstepping. The friend might feel that his autonomy is being violated. The author's actions could be seen as controlling or paternalistic. However, the author's intention is to protect both parties from a potentially harmful relationship. But is that their place to decide?\n\nAnother point is the author's motivation. They mention their friend has been lonely and complaining. The author might be projecting their friend's loneliness onto the relationship, thinking the girl is just a temporary fix. However, if the girl is interested and the friend is willing to pursue it, it's their choice. The author's actions could prevent the friend from having a relationship, even if it's consensual.\n\nAlso, the author is using another friend to help, which suggests they're not acting alone but still taking matters into their own hands. The girl was told directly it wouldn't be a good idea, which is a direct intervention. The girl's response was shy laughter, so maybe she didn't take it seriously. The author's methods might be inappropriate because it's not their role to dictate other people's relationships unless there's actual harm involved.\n\nIn terms of consent, if both parties are willing and of age, it's their decision. The author's actions could be seen as undermining the girl's autonomy as well. The author might be assuming that the girl is being taken advantage of, but there's no evidence of that. The author's judgment based on the girl's appearance is a bit problematic because age is a number, and appearance can be misleading.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the legal aspect is clear\u2014both are adults. The ethical issue is more about autonomy. The author is interfering in a consensual relationship that doesn't involve them. Unless there's abuse or coercion, the author has no right to step in. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by trying to control their friend's choices and the girl's decisions without valid reasons. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they are overstepping by interfering in a consensual adult relationship.\n"
