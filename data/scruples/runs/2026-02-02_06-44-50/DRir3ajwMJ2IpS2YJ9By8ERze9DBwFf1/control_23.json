He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user is asking whether the author, who is a friend of a 31-year-old man, is at fault for trying to prevent him from getting together with an 18-year-old girl. \n\nFirst, the legal aspect: both are adults. In most places, the age of consent is 18, so legally, there's nothing wrong. The author mentions that \"a couple of months ago it would be illegal,\" which suggests that maybe the girl is just slightly over 18 now, making the situation legal. So legally, the man isn't doing anything wrong.\n\nNow, the ethical side. The author is concerned about the age gap. The girl is 18, and he's 31. That's a 13-year difference. Some people might find that significant, but others might not. The author thinks she looks younger, maybe even 16, but the girl is 18. The author is worried about the girl being too young and the relationship being creepy. However, since she's an adult, it's her choice. The author is not her guardian, so maybe they have no right to interfere.\n\nThe author is trying to prevent them from getting together by talking to both parties. They told the girl it's not a good idea, and she laughed shyly. Maybe she's not interested, or maybe she is. The guy is lonely and hasn't had luck with girls. The author is trying to help him find someone his own age, which is understandable. But is it their place to do so?\n\nAnother angle: the author is a friend, so they're concerned about their friend's well-being. Maybe they think the relationship isn't healthy. However, the girl shows genuine interest. The author might be projecting their own discomfort onto the situation. The girl is an adult, so she can make her own decisions. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially since they're not a parent or authority figure.\n\nAlso, the author's other friend is involved in trying to keep them apart. That might be manipulative if they're interfering with the girl's choices without her consent. The girl's reaction was to laugh shyly, which might indicate she's not taking their warnings seriously. The author's interference might be unnecessary or even harmful if it's based on their own discomfort rather than actual harm.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has good intentions, they might be overstepping by trying to control who their friend dates. Since both parties are adults, the decision should be theirs. The author isn't in the wrong legally, but ethically, they might be wrong to meddle in a relationship that doesn't involve them. So the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong)? Hmm. Wait, the options are A for yes (in the wrong) and B for no (not in the wrong). Based on the analysis, the author is overstepping by interfering, so the answer would be A.\n"
