He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is wrong for trying to stop their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old. So first, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, the age of consent is 18, so technically, as both are adults, the relationship is legal. But the author feels the girl looks younger, maybe 16, which used to be illegal. However, since she's 18 now, the legality is there.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author is concerned about the age gap and thinks the girl might be too young. But the girl is 18, which is the legal age, so it's a mature age. The friend is 31, so there's a 13-year gap. Some people might argue that this is a significant difference, but others might say as long as both are adults and consensual, it's okay.\n\nThe author is taking active steps to prevent the relationship, like talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart. The girl seems to be interested in the friend, but the author isn't sure if her interest is purely romantic. However, the friend is trying to make a move, and the author is concerned about the girl's maturity level.\n\nAnother point is the friend's loneliness and past issues with relationships. The author might be acting out of concern for the friend's well-being, thinking he's being taken advantage of or that the girl isn't emotionally ready. But the author isn't in a position to dictate the friend's choices unless there's clear harm or coercion.\n\nIt's also possible that the author's judgment is based on their own discomfort with the age difference rather than the girl's actual behavior or intentions. The fact that the author tried to talk to the girl directly but she laughed it off suggests she isn't against the idea. The friend is the one pushing for a relationship, so maybe the author is overstepping by trying to control the situation.\n\nIn terms of personal autonomy, the friend has the right to choose his own partners as long as it's consensual. The author's actions might be seen as interfering in the friend's personal life under the guise of helping. Unless there's evidence of non-consent or harm, the author's intervention could be considered wrong because they're not the decision-makers in the relationship.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong for trying to stop the relationship based on personal discomfort rather than any legal or ethical violations. The key is that both parties are adults and the relationship is consensual. The author's actions could be hindering the friend's autonomy and the girl's agency.\n"
