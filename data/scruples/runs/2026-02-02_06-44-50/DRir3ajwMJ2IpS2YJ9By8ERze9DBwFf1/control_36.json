He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a 31-year-old friend wanting to date an 18-year-old girl, and the author is trying to stop them. The question is whether the author is wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to check the legal aspects. In the US, the age of consent varies by state, but generally, 18 is the legal age. So the girl is 18, so it's legal. The author is concerned because the girl looks 16, but that's not illegal. So legally, there's no issue. \n\nNext, the author's motivation. They mention their friend has had trouble with relationships and might not be good at recognizing if the girl is interested in a romantic way. The author is worried about a significant age gap. Even though both are adults, a 13-year age difference can raise concerns about maturity levels. The author is trying to protect their friend, thinking he might be vulnerable or that the girl isn't mature enough. \n\nBut is it the author's place to intervene? Friends can give advice, but actively trying to prevent the relationship could be overstepping. The girl isn't a minor, so the author's actions might be considered interference. The friend is an adult and has the right to choose his partners, even if others disagree. However, the author's concern isn't unfounded if they think the girl is using him or he's not in a good state of mind. \n\nThe author's approach\u2014talking to the girl directly and trying to keep them apart\u2014might be seen as manipulating the situation. The girl laughed shyly after being told it wouldn't be a good idea, which could mean she's not interested in the author's opinion. The friend is lonely and has been struggling, so the author's actions might be affecting his autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is looking out for a friend's well-being. If they believe the girl isn't a good match, maybe due to maturity issues, they have valid concerns. However, the method of intervention (actively preventing the relationship) is questionable. \n\nIn some cases, age gaps can work if both parties are consenting adults. The key here is whether the author has the right to interfere in the friend's romantic decisions. While well-intentioned, the author's actions might be crossing a line by not respecting the friend's autonomy. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A), because they're interfering in a legal and consensual relationship between two adults, even if their intentions are good.\n"
