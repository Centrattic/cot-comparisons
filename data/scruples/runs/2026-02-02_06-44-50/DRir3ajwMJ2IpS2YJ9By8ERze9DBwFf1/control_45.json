He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the writer's 31-year-old friend wants to date an 18-year-old girl, and the writer is trying to stop it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age difference. The girl is 18, which is legal in many places, but the writer feels she looks younger. They mention that months ago it would have been illegal, which might refer to a situation where the girl was under 18. Now she's 18, so legally, the age of consent is met. But the writer is still uncomfortable because of the 13-year age gap.\n\nThe writer's friend is struggling with loneliness and hasn't had much success in relationships. The writer is concerned about the age difference and the girl's maturity level, thinking she might be too young. The writer has tried to discourage both the friend and the girl, even to the point of trying to keep them apart.\n\nI need to analyze if the writer's actions are justified. Legally, there's no issue since both are adults. However, the writer is acting as a gatekeeper, making decisions for both parties. The girl is 18 and presumably capable of making her own decisions. The writer's main reasons are personal discomfort and concern for the friend's well-being, but they haven't considered the girl's perspective or autonomy.\n\nThe friend is an adult who can make his own choices. The writer's intervention might be overstepping, especially if the girl is interested and they're both consenting. The writer's actions could be seen as controlling, especially if they're actively trying to keep them apart without either person's consent to do so.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the writer's intentions are to protect their friend from potential heartbreak, but that doesn't justify interfering in the relationship. The girl's autonomy is important here. Unless there's explicit coercion or harm, it's not the writer's place to prevent a relationship based on age alone.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the writer is likely overstepping by trying to control the situation. They're making assumptions about the girl's maturity and the relationship's viability without considering their own role. The answer would be that the writer is in the wrong because they're interfering in a consensual adult relationship based on their own discomfort rather than any actual harm.\n"
