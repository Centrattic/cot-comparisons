He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old. The author's main argument is that the girl seems too young, even though both are legally adults. They've tried to dissuade both the friend and the girl from pursuing a relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, the age of consent is 18, so legally, the relationship is permissible. However, the author feels it's inappropriate because the girl appears younger and the age difference feels large. But legally, that's not a barrier. \n\nNext, the social and ethical considerations. The author is a friend and is intervening because they care, but does that give them the right to interfere in someone else's romantic decisions? The friend is an adult and capable of making his own choices, even if they seem unwise. The author's actions might be seen as overstepping, especially if they're using tactics like trying to keep the two apart, which could be manipulative or controlling.\n\nAlso, the author's justification includes the fact that the girl might look younger. That's subjective and could be a personal opinion rather than an objective issue. The author also mentions the friend's loneliness and past struggles with relationships. Perhaps the friend is trying to move past that, and the author's interference is preventing him from finding the emotional connection he desires.\n\nAnother angle: the girl shows genuine interest, and the author directly told her it's not a good idea. While the author might be trying to protect both parties, they're making a judgment about someone else's potential relationship without full knowledge of the girl's maturity or the nature of their relationship. The author's actions could be seen as undermining the girl's autonomy as well.\n\nIn many cases, friends stepping in when someone is in a bad situation is understandable, but this seems more about personal discomfort with the age difference rather than an obvious harmful situation. The key here is the friend's autonomy. Unless there's evidence of exploitation or harm, it's not the author's place to dictate their friend's romantic choices.\n\nTherefore, the author's actions might be well-intentioned, but they're interfering in a relationship that's legally and consensually allowed. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because they're overstepping their role as a friend and not respecting their friend's right to choose.\n"
