He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from getting together with an 18-year-old girl. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend is 31, and the girl is 18. Both are adults, so legally, there's no issue with their relationship. The user is concerned about the age gap, thinking she looks younger, maybe even 16. But the key here is that she's 18, which is the legal age of consent in most places. The user's argument is that the girl might be too young, but legally, she's an adult. \n\nThe user has tried to discourage both friends from pursuing a relationship. They even told the girl it wouldn't be a good idea, and she laughed shyly. The friend is lonely and has a history of not having luck with girls, so he's grasping for any connection. The user's actions are based on their own discomfort with the age difference, even though the girl is within the legal range.\n\nNow, considering personal relationships, friends can offer advice, but they shouldn't control others' choices if there's no legal or immediate harm. The user is overstepping by actively trying to prevent the relationship. They have no legal authority here, and their actions might be based on their own biases about age gaps. The girl is an adult, so she can make her own decisions. The user's approach might be intrusive and disrespectful of their friend's autonomy. \n\nAlso, the user mentions that the friend is awkward and might not be ready, but that's his personal issue. The user can't decide for him who he can or can't date. Plus, the girl's interest is genuine, so it's her choice whether to pursue it. The user's actions could be seen as manipulative, trying to keep them apart without valid reasons. \n\nIn conclusion, while the user's concern is understandable, they're not in the right because they're interfering in a legal, consensual relationship between two adults. The right to form such relationships should be respected unless there's a harmful element, which isn't indicated here.\n"
