He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's 31-year-old friend wants to get closer to an 18-year-old girl. The author and another friend are trying to stop them. The question is whether the author is right to do so.\n\nFirst, legal age of consent is probably 18 in most places, so technically, they're both adults. But the author feels the girl looks much younger, maybe like 16. That might make the author uncomfortable because of the age difference. But legally, it's allowed.\n\nThen there's the dynamic between the two. The friend is older, more experienced, and the girl is just 18. There's a power imbalance here. The older person might have more social experience or maturity, which could affect the relationship's balance. The author is concerned about this, but is that their place to decide?\n\nThe author is interfering by talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart. The girl laughed shyly, so maybe she's not entirely against the idea. The author is acting as a gatekeeper, which could be overstepping. Even if the author is worried, the two adults should make their own decisions unless there's actual harm or coercion.\n\nAlso, the friend is feeling lonely and the author is preventing him from forming a relationship, which might be controlling. The author might not have enough information about the girl's intentions. Maybe she's serious about him, and the author is projecting their own discomfort onto the friends.\n\nSo, even though the author's intentions are to protect, they're not the ones in the relationship. The key points are autonomy of the two adults, the legality, and the author overstepping their role. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for interfering without a valid reason beyond personal discomfort.\n"
