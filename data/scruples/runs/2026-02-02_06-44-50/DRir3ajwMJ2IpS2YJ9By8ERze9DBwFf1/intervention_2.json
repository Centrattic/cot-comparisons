He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for trying to stop their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, the girl is 18.\n\nFirst, age of consent laws: In many places, 18 is the legal age, so technically, it's legal. The user mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, but since the girl is now 18, it's okay. So legally, there's no issue. That's a key point because the user is basing their discomfort on the girl's appearance or the recent age change rather than the law.\n\nNext, the user's motivation. They say they're trying to protect their friend from getting hurt, maybe because the girl is \"way too young.\" But the girl is an adult, so the user is making a judgment based on her appearance, which might not be fair. Also, the user has already confronted the girl directly, which could be overstepping. The girl's reaction was shy laughter, so maybe she's not interested or just dismissive. The user is also trying to find ways to keep them apart, which could interfere with their friends' autonomy.\n\nAnother angle: The user's friend is lonely and hasn't had luck with women. The user's friend is an adult and capable of making his own decisions. The user's actions could be seen as controlling or not respecting their friend's choice, even if the user thinks they're acting in his best interest. The user's other friend is involved, which adds to the pressure on the 31-year-old.\n\nAlso, the user might be projecting their own discomfort with the age difference. Just because they find it creepy doesn't mean it's wrong. The girl is of legal age, and if both parties consent, it's their choice. The user's actions could be interfering with their friend's happiness and autonomy.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the user is overstepping by trying to control the situation. The legal aspect is satisfied, and the friends involved are adults. The user isn't in a position to make decisions for their friend, especially based on their own discomfort rather than actual harm.\n"
