He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend is 31, and the girl is 18. The author is concerned because the girl looks younger, like 16, and feels it's too soon after she just turned 18. They mention that a few months ago, it would have been illegal because in some places, the age of consent might differ based on the age gap. However, since both are adults, legally it's allowed now.\n\nThe author is trying to stop their friend from pursuing a relationship, maybe out of concern that the girl isn't mature enough or that the relationship is imbalanced. They've directly told the girl it's not a good idea and are working with another friend to keep them apart.\n\nNow, considering the ethics. The author's friend is an adult and capable of making his own decisions. While the author might have good intentions, they're interfering in the friend's personal life and relationships. The girl is also an adult, even if she seems younger. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially since the girl hasn't shown any signs of being coerced or uncomfortable.\n\nThe question here is about consent and autonomy. As adults, both individuals have the right to choose their partners. The author's interference might stem from a place of concern, but it's not their place to make that decision for their friend. Unless there's evidence of manipulation or illegal activity, which isn't mentioned here, the author is overstepping by trying to control the situation.\n\nAdditionally, the author is using their own judgment about the girl's maturity, which they can't accurately assess. Assuming she's not mature enough just because she looks younger is a stereotype. Also, the friend is lonely and the author is projecting their own discomfort onto the situation.\n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're interfering in their friend's adult decisions and relationships without justification.\n"
