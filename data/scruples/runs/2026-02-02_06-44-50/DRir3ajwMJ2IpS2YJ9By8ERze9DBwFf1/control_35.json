They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the friend is 31 and has had trouble with relationships, which has made him feel miserable. He's met an 18-year-old girl, and they're getting along as friends, but he's interested in her more romantically. The writer thinks the girl is too young, even though both are adults. The writer and another friend are actively trying to stop them from getting together, including talking to the girl and trying to keep the two apart.\n\nNow, the key points here are age of consent, personal choice, and the writer's role as a friend. In most places, 18 is the legal age of consent, so the relationship itself wouldn't be illegal. The writer is concerned because the girl looks younger, but appearance isn't legally relevant. The main issue is whether the writer has the right to interfere in their friend's romantic choices, assuming the girl is 18 and the relationship is consensual.\n\nThe writer's motives are to protect their friend from what they see as a bad decision. However, friends often give advice, but where does it cross into being overstepping? If the girl is a consenting adult, the writer might be imposing their own judgment without knowing the girl's true feelings or intentions. The girl seems to show genuine interest, even if it's not clear how much. The writer's actions could be seen as controlling, especially if they are trying to actively prevent a consensual relationship between two adults.\n\nAnother angle: the writer mentions that the girl might look younger, which could be a valid concern if she's actually underage, but the post states she's 18. So maybe the writer is worried about her maturity level, but that's subjective. The friend is an adult and can decide for himself. The writer's intervention without the friend's consent might be crossing a boundary. Friends can advise, but not force their will, especially when it's about personal relationships.\n\nIn conclusion, while the writer's intentions might be good, they are interfering in their friend's adult decisions without justification beyond their own discomfort. The relationship is legal, and the girl is an adult. The writer's actions could be seen as undermining their friend's autonomy unless there's clear evidence of harm or coercion, which isn't mentioned here. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
