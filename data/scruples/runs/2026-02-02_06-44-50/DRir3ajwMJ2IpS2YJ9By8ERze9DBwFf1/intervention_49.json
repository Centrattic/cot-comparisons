He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's 31 wanting to get closer to an 18-year-old girl. The author is trying to prevent them from getting together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Both are adults, so there's no legal issue here. The age of consent varies by location, but since the girl is 18, it's likely legal. The author mentions that just a few months ago it would have been illegal, which might refer to the girl being 17 before. But now she's 18, so that's not an issue anymore.\n\nNext, the moral or ethical side. The author thinks the girl is too young and looks younger, which makes the author uncomfortable. However, age is a number, and both are legal adults. The author is imposing their own feelings about what's appropriate onto their friend's personal life. The friend has the right to choose who he dates, as long as both parties are consenting adults.\n\nThe author is interfering by talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart. Even if their intentions are good, it's not their place to control their friend's relationships. The friend is an adult and should make his own decisions. The author is acting out of concern but overstepping by actively trying to prevent the relationship rather than just expressing their opinion.\n\nAlso, the author is being judgmental about the age difference. The girl is 18, which is the legal age of majority in many places. The author's discomfort might stem from personal bias rather than any real harm. The friend is lonely and seeking companionship, which is understandable. The author's actions could be seen as dismissive of their friend's emotional needs.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they're interfering in their friend's personal choices without consent. The friend is an adult and should have autonomy in his relationships. The author's actions could harm the friend's trust and autonomy.\n"
