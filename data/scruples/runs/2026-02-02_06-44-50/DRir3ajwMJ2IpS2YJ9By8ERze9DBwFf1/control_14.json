He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for trying to stop their friend from dating an 18-year-old. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend is 31, and the girl is 18. Both are adults, so legally, there's no problem. But the author feels the girl looks much younger, maybe even 16, which would make it illegal if it were a few months earlier. The author is worried about the age gap and thinks the girl might not be mature enough. \n\nThe author is trying to prevent them from getting together, even telling the girl it's a bad idea. The friend is lonely and hasn't had luck with women, so he wants to pursue this relationship. The author's concern is about the girl's maturity and the significant age difference.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, legally, it's allowed. The author isn't the one who's supposed to decide what relationships their friend can have. Even if the author thinks the girl isn't the right fit, the friend is an adult and can choose his own partner. The author's actions might be overstepping by directly interfering and trying to keep them apart. \n\nBut maybe there's a point about the girl's maturity. However, that's something the friend should assess on his own. The author's role is to be a friend, not to control their friend's romantic choices. Unless there's evidence of manipulation or harm, it's not the author's place to intervene. \n\nAlso, the author told the girl it wouldn't be a good idea, which might be crossing a line. Friends can give advice, but outright discouraging a relationship could be seen as meddlesome. The friend is the one who has to decide, even if the author disagrees. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is probably in the wrong by interfering in their friend's personal choices without a valid reason beyond their own concerns. The answer is A.\n"
