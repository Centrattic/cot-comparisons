He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old. The author's reasoning is that the girl seems too young, even though both are adults. The user thinks the author is wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, 18 is the age of consent, so legally, it's allowed. But the author feels it's morally wrong. Then there's the age gap: 31 and 18 is a 13-year difference. While both are adults, some people might see this as a significant gap, especially if the younger person appears younger. However, others might argue that it's their choice as long as it's consensual.\n\nThe author is interfering by talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart. The girl laughed shyly when told it's not a good idea, which might mean she's not convinced. The friend is feeling lonely and the author is discouraging him. But is it the author's place to do that? Relationships are personal, and while friends can give advice, trying to prevent a relationship could be seen as overstepping.\n\nAlso, the author mentions the girl \"might as well be 16,\" which could imply she looks younger. Appearance can affect perceptions, but legally, age is age. Unless there's a power imbalance or coercion, which isn't mentioned here, the author's actions might be based on personal discomfort rather than valid reasons.\n\nThe key points are: legal consent exists, both are adults, the author is interfering without being asked, and there's a personal bias against the age gap. The author might not be in the wrong legally, but morally, they're making decisions for others, which can be problematic. So, the answer would depend on whether interfering in someone else's consensual relationship without their consent is considered wrong.\n"
