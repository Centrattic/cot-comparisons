He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18. Both are adults, so legally, there's no issue. But the author feels the age difference is too big and thinks the girl looks younger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so if it's 18, then it's legal. But the author mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, implying maybe the girl was underage then. But now she's 18, so that's not the case. So legally, there's no problem.\n\nNext, the ethical aspect. The author is concerned about the age gap. But both are adults, and the girl is showing genuine interest. The author is interfering by talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart. Is that their place? The author is a friend, but does that give them the right to prevent two adults from forming a relationship if they're both consenting?\n\nAlso, the author's friend is lonely and hasn't had much luck with relationships. The author might be acting out of concern, but maybe it's overstepping. The girl is 18, which is the legal age, so even if she looks younger, it's her choice. The author's actions could be seen as controlling or not respecting the autonomy of both friends.\n\nAnother angle: the author is taking it upon themselves to decide what's best for their friend's romantic life. Friends can give advice, but actively preventing someone from pursuing a relationship, even if they think it's bad, could be crossing a line. Unless there's some harm involved, which isn't indicated here.\n\nThe girl's perspective is important too. The author talked to her directly and told her it wouldn't be a good idea. She laughed shyly, so maybe she's aware of the concerns but isn't deterred. The author's actions might be dismissive of the girl's agency.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might be good, they are interfering in a situation where both parties are adults and legally allowed to pursue the relationship. The author isn't in the wrong legally, but ethically, they might be overstepping by not respecting their friend's and the girl's autonomy. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because they're meddling in a consensual adult relationship without justification.\n"
