He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who posted this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that their 31-year-old friend wants to get with an 18-year-old girl. The author is trying to prevent this, along with another friend. They've even talked to the girl directly and tried to dissuade her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, 18 is the age of consent, so technically, the relationship isn't illegal. But the author feels uncomfortable because the girl looks younger, maybe around 16, and they think she's too young for their friend. But legally, as long as both parties are adults, it's allowed. So maybe the author is overstepping by trying to stop it based on their own feelings about the girl's age.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author's friend is an adult and can make his own decisions about relationships. Even though the author is concerned about their friend's history with relationships and loneliness, does that give them the right to intervene? Friends can offer advice, but actively trying to prevent the relationship might not be their place. The girl is also an adult, so she can decide for herself if she wants to pursue something with the friend.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamics. The 31-year-old is significantly older than the 18-year-old. There's a risk of an imbalance where the older person might have more life experience and could influence the younger one. However, both are adults, so they should be able to handle that. The author's concern could be valid, but it's not their role to police the relationship unless there's clear harm or manipulation, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nThe author mentions that the girl shows genuine interest, though they can't tell if it's friendly. But since she's an adult, her interest is her own to decide. The friends' actions of trying to keep them apart might be based on their own discomfort rather than any real wrongdoing by their friend. The friend is also an adult and can choose whom to date, even if others disagree.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author might be overstepping by interfering in their friend's personal choices. Even if they have good intentions, the friend and the girl are both adults, and the author doesn't have the authority to dictate their relationships. Unless there's a clear case of exploitation, which isn't indicated here, the author is likely in the wrong for trying to prevent the relationship.\n"

  "answer": "A",
  "full_response": "A\n\nThe author is in the wrong. Both individuals involved are adults, and the relationship is legal. While the author may have concerns about the age difference or their friend's judgment, they do not have the authority to interfere in another person's romantic decisions. Adults are capable of making their own choices, and the author's intervention\u2014especially direct discouragement of the girl\u2014crosses ethical boundaries. Friends can express concerns, but actively obstructing a relationship based on personal discomfort is not justified.",
