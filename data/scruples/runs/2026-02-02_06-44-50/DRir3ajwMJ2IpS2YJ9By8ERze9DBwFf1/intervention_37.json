He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The author's friend is 31, and the girl is 18. The author feels the girl is too young, even though both are adults. The author and another friend have actively tried to stop them by talking to the girl and the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, 18 is the legal age of consent, so there's no legal issue here. The author mentions that a few months ago it would be illegal, implying the girl might be under 18 now, but she's stated as 18. So legally, there's no problem.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. Two adults can choose to date each other, regardless of age difference, as long as both are willing and there's no coercion. The author is intervening based on their own discomfort. The question is whether that's overstepping. The author's actions include directly telling the girl it's a bad idea and trying to keep the two apart. That could be seen as violating their autonomy.\n\nThe friend's loneliness is mentioned; maybe the author is projecting their own discomfort onto the situation. The girl shows interest, so maybe she's not just using him. But the author's main issue is the age gap. However, age differences are subjective. 18 vs. 31 is a 13-year gap, but if both are adults, that's their choice. The author's judgment here might be unnecessary.\n\nAlso, the author and friend are taking active steps to prevent the relationship. That's where the ethical line is crossed. They're not just giving an opinion but interfering in the decisions of two adults. The girl is 18, which is the age of majority in most places, so she can make her own choices. The author's actions could be seen as disrespectful to both parties.\n\nIn summary, since both individuals are adults and the relationship is consensual and legal, the author is overstepping by trying to control their decisions. The answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
