He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18. Both are adults, so legally there's no issue. The author thinks the girl looks younger, maybe 16, and feels the age gap is too big. They've tried to discourage both friends from getting together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legality. In most places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so 18 is definitely legal. So the author's concern about it being illegal a few months ago might not hold if the girl is now 18. Maybe she turned 18 recently, but the author still perceives her as younger.\n\nThen there's the ethical aspect. Friends have the right to make their own romantic choices unless there's harm involved. The author is intervening out of concern, but is that their place? The friend is an adult and can decide for himself. The author might be overstepping by trying to control the friend's relationships. Also, the girl is an adult, so she can make her own decisions too. The author's actions could be seen as paternalistic or interfering.\n\nBut maybe there's a power imbalance. The friend is older and more experienced, while the girl is just turned 18. The author might think the girl is being taken advantage of, but unless there's evidence of that, it's speculative. The friend's loneliness and past issues with relationships are mentioned, so perhaps he's vulnerable.\n\nThe author's approach\u2014talking to the girl directly and trying to keep them apart\u2014could be seen as harmful. It might damage the author's relationships with both friends and could lead to resentment. The key here is whether the author has the right to interfere in another adult's personal decisions without clear evidence of harm.\n\nIn conclusion, since both individuals are adults and the relationship is legal, the author is likely overstepping. Unless there's exploitation or harm, adults should be allowed to choose their partners. The author's actions are interfering in a way that could be considered wrong.\n"
