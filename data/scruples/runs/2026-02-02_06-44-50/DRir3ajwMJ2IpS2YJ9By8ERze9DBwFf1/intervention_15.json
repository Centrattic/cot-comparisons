He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from getting together with an 18-year-old girl. The friend hasn't had much luck with relationships, and he's been lonely. The girl is just over 18, and the author feels she's too young, even though they're both technically adults. The author and another friend are actively trying to stop them from dating by talking to both parties.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, the age of consent is 16 or 18. Since the girl is 18, the relationship would be legal. Even though the girl might look younger, legally, it's not a problem. The author's concern about the girl being \"way too young\" is more about their own personal feelings rather than legal or ethical boundaries.\n\nNext, personal autonomy. The author's friend is an adult and has the right to choose his romantic partners. The author stepping in to prevent this could be seen as overstepping. Unless there's evidence of coercion or harm, adults should be free to form relationships. The author might be projecting their own discomfort with the age gap onto their friend.\n\nAlso, the author is trying to influence both their friend and the girl. Telling the girl it's not a good idea and discouraging the friend from pursuing her. Even if the author's intentions are to protect their friend, they don't have the authority to make decisions for him. The friend is mature enough to decide for himself, even if he's made mistakes in the past.\n\nAnother angle is the dynamic between the friends. The author might be overstepping in trying to control their friend's social interactions. Friendship involves trust and respecting each other's choices. If the friend is making a decision that seems unwise to others, the appropriate approach might be to express concerns but not actively interfere.\n\nHowever, there's also the consideration of the girl's maturity. If the girl is indeed very young and not fully mature, but the author has no evidence of that, it's risky to assume. The girl might be independent and capable. The author's judgment based on appearance is problematic. \n\nIn relationships, adults can choose partners regardless of age as long as it's consensual. The author's actions could be seen as controlling. Unless there's a clear risk of harm, it's not their place to stop the relationship. They might be acting out of their own discomfort rather than the friend's best interest. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong. They are interfering in their friend's personal life without justification beyond their own disapproval. The friend is an adult and should have the autonomy to make his own choices, even if they seem unwise to others. The author's actions, like talking to the girl directly and trying to prevent the relationship, are overstepping boundaries. Therefore, the correct answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
