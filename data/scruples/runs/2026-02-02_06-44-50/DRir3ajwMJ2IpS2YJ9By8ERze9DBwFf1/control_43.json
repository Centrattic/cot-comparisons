He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a friend of a 31-year-old guy who's been lonely and has a crush on an 18-year-old girl. The author thinks the girl is too young and is trying to prevent the two from dating. The girl is 18, which is the legal age of consent in most places, so technically, they can date. But the author feels uncomfortable because the girl looks younger, maybe like 16. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the girl is 18, even if she looks younger, it's legal for them to be in a relationship. The age difference here is 13 years, which is significant, but again, as long as both are adults, it's permitted. The author is worried about the power dynamic. A 31-year-old and an 18-year-old might have different life experiences and maturity levels. The girl might be less experienced, which could make the relationship unequal. But the girl has shown genuine interest, so maybe she's aware of what she wants.\n\nThe author's intentions are to protect their friend, thinking he's being lonely and maybe not considering the girl's maturity level. However, by trying to prevent the relationship, the author might be overstepping. The girl is an adult, so she has the right to choose her partner. The author's actions, like talking to the girl directly and trying to keep them apart, might be seen as interfering in the girl's autonomy. \n\nAlso, the author's friend is an adult who can make his own decisions. The author might think they're helping, but they're not accounting for the friend's right to choose his own relationships. Plus, by doing this, they might be contributing to their friend's loneliness and not addressing the root issues of his social struggles. \n\nAnother angle is the potential for the author to be projecting their own discomfort with age gaps. Maybe the author is uncomfortable with the idea of someone older dating someone much younger, which is a personal opinion but not a justification for interference. The key here is consent and legality. As long as both parties are adults and willing, it's their choice. The author's actions could be seen as controlling and not respecting the autonomy of both their friend and the girl. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because they're interfering in a legal, consensual relationship between two adults, even if they disagree with the age difference. The author should have trusted their friend to handle his own relationships and the girl to make her own decisions.\n"
