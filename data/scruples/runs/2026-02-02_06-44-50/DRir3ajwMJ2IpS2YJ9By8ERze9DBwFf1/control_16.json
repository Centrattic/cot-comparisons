He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from getting together with an 18-year-old girl.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Both individuals are adults, so legally there's no issue. The age of consent varies by location, but since the girl is 18, it's likely legal. The author mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, but now it's not. So legally, there's no problem.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The author is concerned about the age gap, thinking the girl might look younger. But since she's 18, even if she appears younger, she's an adult. The author's friend is 31, so there's a 13-year age difference. While some might find that significant, others might not. The author's main issue seems to be personal discomfort with the age difference rather than any actual harm.\n\nThe author is actively trying to prevent the relationship by talking to the girl and their friend. The girl seems to have some interest but is also responding to the author's discouragement with shyness. The friend feels lonely and is being influenced. The author's actions could be seen as interfering in the friend's autonomy. The friend is an adult and should be allowed to make their own decisions about relationships, even if others disagree.\n\nThe author's motives might be good\u2014trying to protect their friend from potential regret or an imbalanced relationship. However, the method of interference without the friend's consent could be problematic. The author isn't considering the friend's perspective or their right to choose. It's possible that the friend is capable of evaluating the situation themselves.\n\nThere's also a question of the author's right to intervene. Unless there's evidence of manipulation or harm, it's not the author's place to decide for their friend. The girl is an adult, so she also makes her own choices. The author's actions might be based on personal judgment rather than facts.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions might be to help, the actions taken violate their friend's autonomy. The relationship is legal and consensual between adults, so the author is overstepping by trying to prevent it. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
