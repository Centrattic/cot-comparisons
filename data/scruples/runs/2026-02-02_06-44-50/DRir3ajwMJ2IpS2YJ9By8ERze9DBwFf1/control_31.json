He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is wrong for trying to stop their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, the age of consent is 16 or 18. Since the girl is 18, it's legally okay. But the writer feels she looks younger, like 16, which might be a concern. However, legally, that's not a valid point because the actual age is 18.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The writer is a friend trying to protect their friend from what they see as a bad situation. Is that their place to do? The friend is an adult, so he can make his own decisions. The writer is interfering, maybe out of concern for both people. But does that overstep?\n\nThe girl seems interested, though the writer isn't sure if it's romantic or just friendship. The writer directly told the girl it's not a good idea. She laughed shyly, maybe not taking it seriously. The writer is also trying to discourage the friend, who is lonely and has had bad luck with relationships. The writer's motives might be good, but they're manipulating the situation by keeping them apart. \n\nIs the age difference a problem? 31 and 18 is a 13-year gap. Some might see that as significant, others not. The key is that both are adults. The writer's concern about the girl's maturity is speculative. Just because someone looks younger doesn't mean they aren't mature enough. The writer is making assumptions about the girl's maturity based on appearance, which isn't fair. \n\nThe main issue is the right of adults to make their own romantic choices. Unless there's evidence of coercion or harm, it's their decision. The writer is acting as a gatekeeper, which isn't their role. Even if the writer thinks it's a bad idea, the friends involved should make their own choices. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they're interfering in the adult decisions of their friend and the girl without valid legal or ethical justification beyond their own concerns.\n"
