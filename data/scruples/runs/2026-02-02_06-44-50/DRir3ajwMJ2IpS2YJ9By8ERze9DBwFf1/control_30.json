He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the writer trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from getting involved with an 18-year-old girl. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, depending on the jurisdiction. Since the girl is 18, and the friend is 31, as long as the location allows consensual relationships between adults, it's technically legal. The writer mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, which might imply that the girl was under 18 at that time, but now she's 18, so that's no longer an issue. So legally, there's no problem here.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The writer and another friend are actively trying to prevent the relationship. They've even told the girl it wouldn't be a good idea. The question is whether the writer has the right to interfere. The friends are concerned about the age difference and the girl's maturity level. The writer thinks the girl is too young-looking, but she's of legal age. The key here is that both parties are adults, so it's their right to form a relationship if they choose. The friends are not in a position to make that decision for them unless there's some form of coercion or exploitation, which isn't indicated here.\n\nThe writer's motivation is based on concern for their friend's well-being and perhaps their own discomfort with the age gap. However, friends can't dictate who others can date, especially when there's no evidence of harm. The writer is being protective, but crossing into controlling behavior might be where the line is. The other friend is involved, and they're trying to \"keep him away,\" which could be seen as manipulative.\n\nThe girl shows genuine interest, even if it's not clear if it's romantic. The writer's direct approach to her by discouraging the relationship could be seen as overstepping, as it's not their place to dictate her choices either. The friends might be projecting their own biases about age differences onto the situation without considering the individuals' feelings and agency.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person acted unreasonably or wrongfully. Here, the writer is acting out of concern but without justification. Since the relationship is between two adults and there's no indication of harm or illegality, the writer is likely overstepping their bounds. Therefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
