He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The situation involves the writer trying to stop their 31-year-old friend from getting involved with an 18-year-old girl. Both are adults, so legally, there's no issue. The writer's reasoning is that the girl looks much younger, maybe like 16, and they feel it's inappropriate. They've tried to discourage both the friend and the girl.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In most places, the age of consent is around 16 or 18, so if the girl is 18, it's legally okay. The writer mentions that a few months ago it would be illegal, which might be due to the girl's age being just above the legal threshold. But since she's now 18, that's not an issue anymore. \n\nNext, the ethical angle. The writer is intervening in their friend's personal life. While they might be concerned about their friend's well-being, they aren't the ones in the relationship. The girl is also an adult and capable of making her own decisions. The writer's actions include directly telling the girl it's not a good idea and trying to keep them apart. That could be seen as overstepping, especially if the girl is interested and the friend is pursuing it consensually.\n\nAlso, the writer's motivation might be influenced by their own biases or discomfort with age gaps. The fact that they think the girl \"looks too young\" might not be a valid reason unless there's evidence of manipulation or coercion, which isn't mentioned here. The friend is an adult too, so he has the right to choose his partners, even if the age difference is significant.\n\nAnother point is that the writer's friend is lonely and has had past issues with relationships. The writer's intervention might be coming from a place of wanting to protect their friend, but they're not in a position to dictate his romantic choices. The girl's interest is mentioned as genuine, so the writer's interference could be undermining her autonomy as well.\n\nIn terms of personal boundaries, the writer is stepping into roles they don't have, like a gatekeeper for their friend's relationships. Unless there's a clear risk of harm, adults should be free to form relationships. The writer's actions might be more about their own discomfort rather than the friend's best interest.\n\nSo putting it all together, the writer is likely overstepping by trying to control the situation. They have no legal grounds, and ethically, they're not in a position to intervene in this way. The answer would be that they are in the wrong (A).\n"
