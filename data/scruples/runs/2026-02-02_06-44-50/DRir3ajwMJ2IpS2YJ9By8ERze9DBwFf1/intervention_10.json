He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The friend is 31, the girl is 18. They're getting along as friends, but the guy wants more. The author and another friend are trying to stop them from getting together. The author argues that while both are adults, the girl looks younger, and the age gap feels too big. They even went so far as to tell the girl it's not a good idea and tried to keep the friends apart.\n\nNow, the legal aspect: In most places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so as long as they're both adults, it's legally okay. The age difference here is 13 years, which is legally permissible. So the author's concern about legality might be outdated or based on a misunderstanding.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The author is interfering in their friend's personal life. Even if they have good intentions, it's not their place to control who their friend dates. The author's actions include directly telling the girl it's a bad idea, which could be seen as overstepping. The girl's feelings or intentions aren't for the author to dictate.\n\nThere's a part where the author mentions the girl \"might as well be 16\" but that's just their perception. The girl is 18, so even if she looks younger, legally and socially, she's an adult. The author's discomfort with the age gap might stem from personal biases rather than actual harm.\n\nAlso, the friend is feeling lonely and the author is dismissing his feelings by trying to keep them apart. The author's actions could be seen as undermining their friend's autonomy and happiness. Friends can give advice, but actively trying to prevent a relationship is a different matter.\n\nAnother point is that the author didn't mention discussing this with their friend in a supportive way. Instead, they took unilateral action, which might not be the healthiest approach. The friend might need guidance, not manipulation.\n\nSo putting it all together: The key issues are legal permissibility, personal autonomy, and the appropriateness of interference. The author is overstepping by trying to control the situation, even if their intentions are protective. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
