He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old. So the main points are the ages of the people involved and the author's actions.\n\nFirst, both individuals are legally adults. The girl is 18, which is the legal age of consent in many places. So legally, there's no issue. The author mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, but since the girl is now 18, that's not the case anymore. The author's concern might be more about societal norms or personal feelings rather than legality.\n\nThe author is intervening by talking to both the friend and the girl. They told the girl it wouldn't be a good idea, and the girl laughed shyly. The friend is being discouraged but still feels lonely and wants to pursue the relationship. The author and another friend are actively trying to keep them apart.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspect. The author's actions are based on their own discomfort and concern about the age difference. However, the key here is autonomy. The 31-year-old friend is an adult and should have the right to choose who he dates, as long as it's consensual and legal. The girl is also an adult. The author is essentially making a decision on behalf of their friend, which could be seen as overstepping. Unless there's evidence of harm or coercion, which isn't mentioned here, the author might be infringing on their friend's personal freedom.\n\nThe author's motivation might be coming from a place of caring, but the method of intervention could be problematic. The friend is already feeling lonely and unhappy, so preventing him from pursuing a relationship, even if the author thinks it's a bad idea, could be unkind. The girl's reaction (laughing shyly) suggests she's not offended, so maybe the author's concerns are exaggerated.\n\nIn summary, while the author has concerns, the individuals involved are of legal age to make their own decisions. The author isn't in a position to dictate their friend's romantic choices unless there's a clear, immediate risk. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for interfering in what's a consensual adult relationship.\n"
