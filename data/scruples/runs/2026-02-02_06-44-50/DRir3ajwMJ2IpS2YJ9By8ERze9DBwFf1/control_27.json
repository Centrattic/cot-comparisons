He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18. The author is concerned about the age gap, even though both are adults. The girl is still under 18, but wait, 18 is the legal age in many places. Wait, the user mentioned that a few months ago it would have been illegal. So maybe the girl just turned 18? Or the age of consent was lower before? Let me check the dates. The situation now is the girl is 18, and the friend is 31. If the girl is 18 and the friend is 31, then legally, as long as the girl is 18, it's legal. But the author is still uneasy because the girl looks younger.\n\nThe author is trying to stop them from getting together. They've told the girl it's not a good idea, and the friend is resistant. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the legal aspect: if the girl is 18, then the relationship is legal. The author can't prevent a legal relationship just because they don't like the age difference. However, the author's concern might be about the girl being immature or there being a power imbalance. But that's not their place to decide. The author's friend is an adult and can make his own choices. \n\nThe author's actions might be overstepping. Unless there's actual harm or non-consensual elements, the author shouldn't interfere. The girl is also an adult, so she can consent. The author's judgment based on appearance (thinking she looks 16) isn't valid. The author's motivation is to protect their friend, but that's not their responsibility. The friend is an adult and should decide his own relationships.\n\nSo, the answer is that the author is in the wrong because they're interfering in a legal and consensual relationship between two adults. They can express their concerns, but actively trying to prevent it goes beyond that. Hence, answer A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
