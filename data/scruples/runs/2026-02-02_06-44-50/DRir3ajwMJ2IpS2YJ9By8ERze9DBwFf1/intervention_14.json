He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe friend is 31, and he's been having trouble with relationships. He's met an 18-year-old girl, and they're getting along, but he wants a romantic relationship. The author is concerned about the age gap and is actively trying to prevent their relationship, even talking to the girl directly about it. The author and another friend are trying to keep them apart.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, 18 is the age of consent, so legally, there's no issue. But the author feels like the girl looks younger, maybe 16, which is under the legal age. However, since she's actually 18, the legality isn't a factor here. The author's discomfort might be more about perception than reality.\n\nNext, the ethical side. The author is trying to influence both friends' decisions. The friend is an adult, capable of making his own choices, even if they seem unwise. The author's intervention could be seen as overstepping, especially since the girl is also an adult. Both individuals have the right to choose their partners, and the author isn't in a position to make that decision for them.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's role as a friend. While friends can offer advice, actively trying to prevent a relationship might damage trust. The author might be projecting their own discomfort or not fully respecting their friend's autonomy. Additionally, the friend's loneliness and the girl's interest are factors that the author isn't considering\u2014maybe the relationship could be beneficial for both.\n\nAnother angle is the author's motivation. They mention the friend's past loneliness and complaints, so maybe they're trying to help prevent heartbreak or protect their friend. However, the method of intervention\u2014talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart\u2014could be harmful. The girl is also an adult, so she should have the right to decide her own relationships, and the author's actions might not have her best interests at heart.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The author is concerned about the girl being \"too young,\" but age is just a number. If both are adults, the relationship is consensual. The author might not have all the information\u2014maybe the girl is mature beyond her years, or the relationship is healthy. The author's judgment could be based on personal biases rather than the actual situation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is overstepping by trying to control their friend's romantic life and the girl's decisions. Even if the author's intentions are good, the actions are intrusive and disrespectful to both parties' autonomy. So, the answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
