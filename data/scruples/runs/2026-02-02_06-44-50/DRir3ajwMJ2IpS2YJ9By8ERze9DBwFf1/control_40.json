He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18. The author and another friend are actively trying to stop them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, the legal age of consent is 16 or 18, so an 18-year-old is legally an adult. Since both are adults, the relationship isn't illegal. The author mentions that just a few months ago it would have been illegal, but now it's okay. So legally, there's no issue here.\n\nNext, the ethical side. The author thinks the girl is too young and looks younger, but age is just a number once both are adults. The girl is showing genuine interest, though the author isn't sure if it's friendly or romantic. The friend is lonely and has had bad luck with relationships. The author is acting out of concern, but they're interfering without the girl's consent. The girl was told directly by the author that it's not a good idea, which might be crossing a line.\n\nAlso, the author's motives might be influenced by their own discomfort. They find the age difference creepy, but that's a personal feeling. They shouldn't impose their personal standards on others unless there's a clear harm. The girl isn't a minor, so it's her choice to date whom she wants. The author has no right to interfere in consensual adult relationships.\n\nHowever, if the girl is genuinely underage or there's manipulation involved, that's different. But the scenario states she's 18. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping, trying to control others' relationships. Unless there's a valid reason like exploitation, the author is not in the right to prevent a consensual relationship between two adults.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they're interfering in a legal and consensual relationship based on personal discomfort rather than actual harm.\n"
