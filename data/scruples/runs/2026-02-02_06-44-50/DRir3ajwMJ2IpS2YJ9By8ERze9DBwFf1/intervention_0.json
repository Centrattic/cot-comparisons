He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context is that the friend is 31 and the girl is 18. Both are adults, so legally, there's no issue. The author is concerned about the age difference, even though they're both of legal age. The author's argument is that the girl looks younger, and they feel it's inappropriate. They've taken active steps to prevent the relationship, including talking to the girl directly and trying to keep their friend away from her.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The main point is that the author is intervening in their friend's personal life without being asked. The friend is an adult and capable of making his own decisions. Even if the author is concerned about their friend's well-being, they don't have the authority to dictate his romantic choices. The girl is also an adult, so it's her decision whether she's interested in a relationship with someone older. The author's actions might be stemming from good intentions, but they're overstepping by trying to control the situation.\n\nAnother angle is the age gap. While the legal age is 18, societal norms might view a significant age difference differently. However, that's subjective. The author's discomfort is their own feeling, but it's not a justification to interfere. The friend is lonely and has struggled in the past, so the author's interference could be adding to his isolation instead of supporting him.\n\nThe girl's reaction was to laugh shyly when the author told her it wouldn't be a good idea. That suggests she's not taking their advice seriously, which might mean she's not interested or the author's concerns are not shared by her. The author's approach could be seen as meddlesome and disrespectful of both their friend and the girl's autonomy.\n\nIn summary, while the author might have good intentions, they're overstepping by trying to prevent their friend from pursuing a relationship with an adult. Adults have the right to choose their partners, and the author's actions don't consider that autonomy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
