He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. Both people are adults, so technically there's no legal issue. The age of consent is 18 in many places, so the relationship isn't illegal. But the author feels it's too young because the girl looks younger. That's a personal opinion, not a legal one.\n\nThen there's the social and ethical angle. The author is concerned about the friend's maturity and the power dynamics. A 31-year-old and an 18-year-old can have a significant age gap. The girl is still in her early adulthood, maybe just out of high school, so she might not be as emotionally mature as someone older. But the author isn't the one making the relationship decisions; that's the friend and the girl's choice.\n\nThe author is interfering by talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart. That crosses into controlling behavior. Friends can give advice, but actively preventing two people from being together without their consent is overstepping. The author might think they're helping, but they're not the decision-makers here. The friend's autonomy should be respected unless there's abuse or coercion, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation might be based on their own discomfort or the friend's loneliness. But that doesn't justify interfering. The right approach would be to support the friend, maybe discuss concerns openly, but not to take actions that block their relationships.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because they're interfering in a consensual relationship between adults, which isn't their place to control.\n"
