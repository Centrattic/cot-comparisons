He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for trying to stop their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18. The author thinks the girl looks much younger, maybe like 16, and is concerned because just a few months ago, that relationship would have been illegal (probably due to age of consent laws varying by state). They've tried to discourage both the friend and the girl, even telling the girl directly it's a bad idea.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many U.S. states, the age of consent is 16 or 18. If the girl is 18, then it's legal. But the author mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, which might mean the girl was under 18 at that time. So maybe she just turned 18, or there's a specific law in their area. If it's legal now, then the author's legal concern might be outdated. However, if there's a close-in-age exemption, sometimes there's a \"Romeo and Juliet\" law that allows for relationships where the age difference isn't too big if both are minors. But once the girl is 18, the 31-year-old is 13 years older. That's a significant age gap, but both are adults now.\n\nNext, the ethical side. The author is worried about the girl's maturity level, thinking she looks 16. Even though she's 18, maybe she's not emotionally mature. The author is acting out of concern for their friend and the girl. But does that justify interfering? The friend is an adult and has the right to make his own choices, even if they seem unwise. The author isn't the one in the relationship; they can offer advice, but trying to prevent it could be overstepping. The girl is also an adult, so even if she's not mature, it's her choice unless there's clear evidence of manipulation or coercion.\n\nAnother angle: the author is using their influence to keep them apart. They've told the girl directly it's a bad idea, which might be considered meddling. If the girl isn't being pressured, she can decide for herself. However, if the author feels the girl isn't in a strong position (e.g., power imbalance), that's different. But the scenario doesn't mention that. The girl shows interest, so maybe she's not being coerced.\n\nThe friend's loneliness and past struggles are mentioned. The author might be projecting their own judgment, thinking the friend should date someone closer in age. But as adults, relationships are personal choices. The author's actions could be seen as controlling, even if well-intentioned. Unless there's a legal violation, it's not the author's place to intervene.\n\nSo, putting it all together: If the relationship is legal now, the author is overstepping by trying to prevent it. Even if they have concerns about maturity, the individuals involved are adults. Unless there's exploitation, the author isn't in the wrong legally but may be ethically questionable. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the answer is A or B, and the legal aspect is okay (if the girl is 18), then the author is in the wrong for trying to meddle in adults' decisions. So answer A.\n"
