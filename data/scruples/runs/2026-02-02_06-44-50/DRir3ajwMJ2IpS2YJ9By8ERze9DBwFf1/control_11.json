He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for trying to stop their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to check the legal aspect. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18. If the girl is 18, then legally, it's okay. The author mentions that a few months ago it would be illegal, implying that maybe the girl was under 18 before. But now she's 18, so the age difference is 13 years. However, some states have close-in-age exemptions, so even with a 13-year gap, if both are adults, it might be legal. So the relationship is probably legal now.\n\nNext, ethical considerations. The author is concerned about the age gap. But both parties are adults. The girl shows genuine interest, and the guy is just awkward. The author\u5e72\u6d89\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u4fb5\u72af\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6743\u3002The author is taking actions like talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart. That could be seen as overstepping, especially since they're not the girl's guardians. The girl is an adult and can make her own decisions. The author might be projecting their own discomfort with the age difference rather than respecting both individuals' choices.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation: they mention the friend has been lonely and complaining. Maybe the author is trying to help, but the method is wrong. The friend's autonomy should be respected. Unless there's evidence of manipulation or harm, it's not the author's place to intervene. They might be acting out of concern but are not in the wrong legally or ethically? Wait, no. Interfering in someone else's relationships without their consent is generally not okay. So the author is overstepping by trying to prevent a legal, consensual relationship between two adults.\n\nSo the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they are interfering in a consensual adult relationship without justification. But wait, maybe some argue that the age difference is problematic. However, as long as both parties are adults and consent is mutual, it's their right to choose. The author has no authority to dictate their friend's romantic choices.\n"
