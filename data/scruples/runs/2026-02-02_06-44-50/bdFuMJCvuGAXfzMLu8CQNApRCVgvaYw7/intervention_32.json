I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours so she can have some alone time. They live in a studio apartment, which is small, so they don't have much privacy. The husband works part-time and spends a lot of time at home. The author wants some alone time, but when she asks, he feels hurt and says it's not fair. She mentions that he's home alone on other days and that their financial situation prevents them from moving to a bigger place.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author has a valid need for personal space. Living in a studio can be challenging for both people to have their own time. It's reasonable to want some solitude, especially if she's used to living alone and values that. On the other hand, the husband is feeling hurt and maybe neglected. His job is part-time, so he might not have as many social interactions, so being asked to leave could make him feel unappreciated or unwanted. His reaction could stem from insecurity about his role in the relationship or feeling that his partner isn't considering his needs.\n\nFinancial constraints are also a factor. They can't move to a bigger apartment right now, so they have to work with the space they have. The author's request isn't excessive\u2014just a couple of hours. But the husband's response is emotional, which complicates things. It's possible that communication is an issue here. The husband might need to express his feelings more clearly, while the author might need to acknowledge his feelings and find a middle ground. Maybe they can agree on specific times when each can have space, or find alternative ways for him to spend time when she needs alone time, like engaging in activities outside but not necessarily leaving the apartment. The key is mutual understanding and compromise. Since the author's request is reasonable and the husband's feelings are valid but his reaction is hurtful, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but both could work on communication. So the answer would be B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
