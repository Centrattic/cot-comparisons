I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a couple of hours. \n\nFirst, the context is a studio apartment. Studio apartments are small, so it's understandable that having someone else around all the time can be stressful. The author mentions they both work, but the husband works less hours and is home more often. The key issue here is the lack of alone time for the author. They value solitude and sometimes need space to themselves, which is a reasonable need.\n\nThe husband's reaction seems to be emotional. When she asks him to leave for a few hours, he feels hurt and questions the exact time and his activities. That might indicate he's feeling rejected or not included, which is a valid concern too. However, the author is expressing a need for personal time, which is important for mental well-being. \n\nThe husband's job situation is unstable, and they can't move to a bigger place right now. So the author isn't being unreasonable in their request; it's about coping in a small space. The husband's response might be more about his feelings of not belonging in the home yet, as he's been there two years but it doesn't feel like his. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid need for alone time, which is important in a relationship. The husband needs to work on his feelings of unwelcomeness, perhaps through communication or finding ways to be comfortable at home independently. The author's request is reasonable given the circumstances. So answer B.\n"
