I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple living in a studio apartment with limited space, leading to the author asking their husband to leave for a few hours on weekends. The husband feels hurt and doesn't understand why they can't find a bigger place yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author values alone time, which is a reasonable need. Studio apartments are small, so having no alone time when both are home is understandable. The husband works fewer hours, so he's home more, which might make him feel like he's not wanted. The author's request might be seen as necessary for their mental health, but the husband's reaction is about feeling unwelcome.\n\nThe husband's point about the weekends is a bit confusing. He mentions not having a relaxing weekend if they go on a day trip, but he's home alone on Friday and Monday. That seems contradictory. The author might be frustrated that he doesn't use the other days to have time away, but maybe he's not used to being alone or doesn't have a social circle to fill that time.\n\nThe author isn't wrong for needing personal space. Everyone needs some time to themselves. However, the way the request is framed might be part of the issue. If the husband feels like he's being asked to leave frequently without a compromise, that could hurt his feelings. The author could consider alternative solutions, like finding activities that they can do separately in the apartment or setting a schedule that allows both to have alone time without feeling like they're being excluded.\n\nAlso, the financial aspect mentioned\u2014his unstable job and the city's housing market\u2014means moving isn't an immediate option. So the author's situation is a temporary one, which might help in understanding the urgency. The husband's reaction might stem from not feeling at home yet, which is a valid feeling. Maybe the author hasn't fully integrated their partner into the living space, leading to his sense of displacement.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties need to communicate their needs. The author is not in the wrong for needing alone time, but perhaps could approach the request in a way that acknowledges the husband's feelings. The husband, on the other hand, might need to work on managing his feelings of being unwelcome and finding ways to spend time alone when necessary.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), because the author isn't wrong for needing personal space, but the situation requires mutual understanding and compromise. The husband's hurt feelings are valid but should be addressed through dialogue rather than making it a conflict.\n"
