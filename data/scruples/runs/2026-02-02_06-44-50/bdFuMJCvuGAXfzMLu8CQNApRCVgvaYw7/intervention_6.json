I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment with no privacy. The husband works fewer hours and doesn't go out much, while the author values alone time. When she asks him to leave, he feels hurt and unappreciated.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: She needs alone time because the apartment is small and they're always together. She's working full-time, so maybe she's stressed and needs personal space. Her husband's job is unstable, so moving isn't an option yet. She's not asking for a huge amount of time, just a couple of hours on a Saturday.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's reaction: He feels unwelcome in his own home. He's home alone a lot, but when she asks him to leave, he takes it personally. He's not meeting friends as much as he could, but he's supposed to find something to do. He's also stressed about his job, which might make him more sensitive.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual needs. The author is asking for something reasonable\u2014alone time. However, the way she's doing it might be triggering her husband's feelings of being unwelcome. Maybe she's not considering his emotional state, especially since he's already feeling insecure about his job and his place in the home. The husband's reaction is valid because he's feeling rejected. \n\nBut the author's need for alone time is also valid. In a shared living space, especially a studio, both partners need to have some autonomy. The problem might be that the author isn't communicating her needs in a way that acknowledges his feelings. Instead of just asking him to leave, maybe they could find a compromise, like scheduling times when each can have alone time without the other feeling excluded. \n\nHowever, the question is whether she's in the wrong. She's not doing anything unethical, but perhaps her approach could be more considerate. The husband's emotional response is significant, so maybe she's not considering his perspective enough. On the flip side, her need for privacy is understandable given the living situation. It's a balance. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the request is reasonable and how it's communicated. Since she's asking for a couple of hours on a Saturday and not every day, it's reasonable. But the husband's feelings are valid too. The problem might be more about their communication style rather than who's in the wrong. However, since the husband is taking it as a personal rejection, maybe the author could approach it differently. But ultimately, she's not wrong for needing alone time. The husband is also not wrong for feeling hurt, but that doesn't mean the author is in the wrong. So maybe the author is not in the wrong, but they need better communication. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
