I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave for a few hours in their studio apartment. The author explains that they both live there, and the husband works part-time, often staying home. The author values alone time, so they ask him to leave so they can have some privacy. The husband gets hurt and questions why the author isn't specifying the time or activities. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The author has a valid need for personal space, especially in a studio apartment where separate areas are limited. They work full-time, and the husband works part-time, so maybe the author has less free time. The husband, on the other hand, feels unwelcome and possibly neglected, which is a legitimate emotional response. His job being unstable and not working much might contribute to his feelings of not being needed in the home.\n\nCommunication is key here. The author is asking for something reasonable\u2014some time alone\u2014but the way it's presented might make the husband feel like he's being rejected. Maybe the author could find a better way to express their need without making him feel excluded. However, the husband's reaction seems a bit exaggerated. The author isn't asking for the entire weekend to be alone, just a couple of hours each Saturday. Plus, the husband has plenty of other free days in the week. The husband's insistence on knowing exact hours and activities might be overcompensating for his insecurities.\n\nFinancial situation is another factor. They can't move to a bigger place right now, so the author has to manage the current setup. The husband might feel like he's always at home and the author is the only one needing space. Maybe the author could also take some time to understand his feelings and find a compromise, like scheduling alone time without making him feel like he's being sent away. But the author's request itself isn't unreasonable. So, I think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a legitimate need for personal space, and the husband's reaction might stem from deeper issues rather than the request itself.\n"
