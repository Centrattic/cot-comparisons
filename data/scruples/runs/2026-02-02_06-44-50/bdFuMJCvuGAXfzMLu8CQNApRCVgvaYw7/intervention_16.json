I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (TA) is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave their studio apartment for a few hours. The situation is that they live in a small space with no privacy, and the husband works part-time, spending a lot of time at home. The author wants some alone time, which she's used to, and when she asks him to go out, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid need for personal space, especially given the living situation. Studio apartments can be challenging for couples because there's no separation of spaces. She's working full-time and probably needs downtime without the presence of her partner. Her reasoning seems reasonable; she's not saying he can't be there all the time, just that she needs a few hours alone sometimes.\n\nOn the husband's side, he's part-time and might feel that the home is more hers, leading to feelings of not belonging. His reaction is emotional, interpreting her request as not wanting him in the home. That's a red flag because he's connecting her need for space with his self-worth or sense of belonging. He also questions the exact hours and what he's supposed to do, which could indicate he's not taking responsibility for his own needs and is expecting her to accommodate his schedule instead.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate if that's accurate. The key points are communication and mutual needs. The author is expressing her need without being hostile, but the husband is overreacting. The husband's job instability and financial issues are part of their situation, but that doesn't negate the author's need for personal time. They're planning to move once his job improves, which is a future solution, but in the present, she's trying to manage their current living situation.\n\nThe husband's response\u2014feeling hurt and not welcome\u2014is a misreading of her request. She's asking for a few hours, not excluding him entirely. He's also avoiding taking initiative to find activities for himself, relying on her to specify. The author isn't wrong in wanting alone time; it's a common issue in close living quarters. The real issue might be the husband's inability to handle the request without feeling rejected, which points more to his emotional response than her actions.\n\nSo, the answer is B (not in the wrong). The author is justified in seeking personal space, and the husband's reaction is the problematic part here. The TA isn't wrong for setting boundaries when needed.\n"
