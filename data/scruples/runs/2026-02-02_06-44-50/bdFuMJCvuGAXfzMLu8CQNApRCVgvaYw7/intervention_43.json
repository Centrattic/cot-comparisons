I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The scenario involves a studio apartment with no alone time, the husband working part-time, and the wife wanting some personal space. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife values her alone time and has a full-time job, which is understandable. A studio apartment doesn't have separate rooms, so privacy is a challenge. She's asking her husband to leave to have a couple of hours to herself, which seems reasonable. However, the husband feels hurt and doesn't want to go out because he doesn't have friends to meet. He also feels like he isn't welcome in his own home when she asks.\n\nThe husband's reaction is important. If he's getting hurt and reacting negatively when asked to leave for a few hours, that might indicate issues in communication or emotional needs not being met. The wife isn't asking for the entire weekend; just a few hours on a Saturday afternoon. She also mentions that he has free time on other days, like Friday and Monday. The husband's argument about not having a relaxing weekend if he can't be home on Saturday seems a bit extreme, especially since he has other days off.\n\nThe financial aspect is another point. They can't move to a bigger place due to his unstable job and high costs in the city. So, the immediate solution isn't feasible. The wife's request for alone time is a reasonable ask given the living situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's feelings of not being wanted might stem from insecurity or feeling neglected. If he's not going out much and relies on being home, the wife's request could be a trigger for him. However, it's also his responsibility to find activities or friends to keep himself occupied, even if he's not working much. The wife isn't asking him to leave for extended periods, just a couple of hours.\n\nI think the key here is mutual understanding. The wife has a valid need for personal space, especially in a cramped living situation. The husband's hurt feelings are valid too, but he needs to address his own social activities. The author isn't in the wrong for asking for time alone; the issue might be more about the husband's reaction and their communication. So, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
