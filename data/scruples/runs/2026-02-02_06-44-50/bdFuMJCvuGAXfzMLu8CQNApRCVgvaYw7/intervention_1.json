I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple living in a studio apartment where the wife asks her husband to leave for a few hours. The husband reacts hurt and feels unwelcome.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The wife values alone time because they're in a small space and she can't have privacy. She mentions that he doesn't go out much and has a lot of free time. On the other hand, the husband feels that when she asks him to leave, he's not welcome in his own home. He also points out that he's home alone on other days, so maybe he's struggling with feeling isolated.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual needs. The wife has a legitimate need for personal space, especially in a studio apartment. But the husband's reaction might stem from feeling that his presence is a burden. The problem might be communication\u2014maybe she's not expressing her needs in a way that he feels respected. Also, the husband might need to engage more in activities outside the home, but he's not working much and doesn't have a social circle. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess if that's fair. If the wife is only asking for a couple of hours on a Saturday and the husband is available on other days, maybe it's reasonable. However, the husband's hurt feelings suggest that there's an emotional component here\u2014perhaps he feels rejected or that the home isn't his. \n\nAlso, considering the context of their financial situation and the husband's job instability, moving might not be an option yet. So, they need to find a solution within their current living arrangement. The wife might need to find a balance between her need for space and his need to feel included. Maybe setting boundaries or finding other times when he can have activities could help. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If she's asking for reasonable alone time without making him feel unwelcome, maybe she's not wrong. However, if her requests are causing emotional harm without considering his feelings, then perhaps she's at fault. It's a bit of a balance. The husband's reaction might be over the top, but the wife's need is valid. \n\nI think the main issue is communication. The wife might not be addressing his feelings properly. Instead of just asking him to leave, maybe discussing the need for space in a way that includes him, like suggesting he use the time to do something he enjoys, could help. If she's making it clear that it's not about him but her needing time, but he's still hurt, maybe she needs to find another way to communicate that. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting alone time. However, the way she communicates her needs might be causing the problem. The husband's reaction is also a valid concern. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might be B (No), but there's room for improvement in how she approaches the situation.\n"
