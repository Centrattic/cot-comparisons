I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a couple of hours. They live in a studio apartment, so space is limited. She works full-time, he works part-time. She wants some alone time because she values it and has always loved living alone. But when she asks him to leave, he feels hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Also, there's the issue of finding a bigger apartment because of financial reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's need for personal space is valid. Studio apartments can make it hard to have alone time, especially if one person is home more. She's not asking for a long time, just a couple of hours. On the other hand, her husband is taking it personally, feeling unwelcome. Maybe he's not getting enough social interaction or feels neglected. His job is unstable, and he might not have many opportunities to socialize. \n\nThe husband's reaction might stem from insecurity or feeling that he's not a part of the home. If he's home a lot, maybe he's not used to being out and about. The author's request could be a way to manage their different needs for space and social activity. However, the way she asks might come off as dismissive of his feelings if it's not framed properly. \n\nBut the core issue is about mutual respect and meeting each other's needs. The author isn't wrong in wanting her space. The problem might be communication. If she's clear that she needs time for herself without making him feel unwelcome, that's different. The husband's reaction seems to stem from feeling rejected. Maybe they need to find a middle ground, like setting specific times when they can have alone time without making him feel pushed out. \n\nAlso, considering the financial constraints, moving isn't an option yet. They need to work on coping strategies in their current situation. The author's request is reasonable, but the husband's feelings need to be addressed. It's a balance between individual needs and the relationship. So the author isn't in the wrong, but communication is key here. The answer is B.\n"
