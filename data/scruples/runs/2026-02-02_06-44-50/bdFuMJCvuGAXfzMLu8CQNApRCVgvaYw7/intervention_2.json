I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author lives in a studio apartment with her husband. They don't have kids, and she works full-time while he works part-time. She's asking him to leave for a couple of hours on weekends to have some alone time because the studio apartment doesn't give them space. But when she does this, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The husband feels like the apartment isn't his home yet and is upset when she asks him to go out. The author is frustrated because he doesn't go out much anyway and has plenty of free time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author values alone time a lot, which is understandable, especially in a small living space. But the husband is sensitive to being asked to leave, interpreting it as not being welcome. There's a communication issue here. The husband might feel that his need for being at home is being dismissed, even though he has the time. On the other hand, the author is trying to balance her need for personal space with their shared living situation.\n\nThe husband's reaction seems a bit over-the-top. If he's home most of the time anyway and has the financial stability to work part-time, maybe he could find other ways to spend his time. But his feelings of not feeling at home might stem from not being fully integrated into the living space yet. The author might be dismissing his emotional response by pointing out his free time, but emotions aren't always logical.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they can't move because of financial issues. So, they have to work with the current situation. The question is whether asking for a few hours alone is unreasonable. In a studio apartment, sharing a space without partitions can make alone time difficult. However, the husband's reaction of feeling excluded might be a problem. The author isn't being selfish, but she's trying to meet her own needs, which are valid.\n\nOn the flip side, the husband's feelings of not having a home might need addressing. Maybe there's a way to create some boundaries without him having to leave. The author could be more empathetic towards his feelings, but he also needs to take responsibility for his own emotional response. It's a two-way street. The author isn't in the wrong for needing space, but perhaps could communicate better. The husband's reaction is part of the problem too. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong, but there's room for both sides to improve communication.\n"
