I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a couple of hours. They live in a studio apartment, so space is limited. The author values alone time, which makes sense. The husband works part-time and doesn't go out much, so when the author asks him to leave, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's need for personal space is valid, especially given the small living situation. People often need time alone to recharge. On the other hand, the husband feels that the home isn't his and gets upset when asked to leave. He might feel that his presence is always expected, which could lead to resentment if not addressed.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author is trying to meet their own needs, which are reasonable. However, they might not be considering how their request affects the husband's feelings of belonging. The husband's reaction suggests he might have deeper insecurities about his role in the relationship or his self-worth tied to being present at home.\n\nLooking at the options: A says the author is in the wrong. B says they aren't. The author's actions are about self-care, which is important. But maybe they need to communicate better, find compromises, or address the husband's feelings. However, the husband's response of feeling hurt and unwelcome is his own reaction, which he needs to manage. The author isn't wrong for needing space, but they might need to approach the situation more sensitively. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would be B (No) because their request is reasonable, and the husband's hurt feelings are his own issue to handle. The author isn't at fault for valuing their alone time.\n"
