I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple living in a studio apartment where the author asks her husband to leave for a few hours to have alone time. The husband reacts hurt, feeling unwelcome, and there's tension about moving to a bigger apartment due to financial instability.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author has a valid need for personal space, especially since they live in a small space. It's common for people to need some alone time, and the husband being home a lot might contribute to that. However, the husband's feelings are also important. He moved in two years ago and might still be adjusting. His job is part-time and unstable, so maybe he's not used to having much time alone, or he feels the request is unfair given his limited social interactions.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that she wants time to herself, which is reasonable, but the way she's handling it might be causing more stress. The husband feeling he doesn't have a relaxing weekend because of the day trip and the requested Saturday time might indicate he's not getting enough alone time too. The fact that he's home alone on Friday and Monday but still feels this way could mean he's not utilizing that time well or feels isolated.\n\nThe author's mention of not being able to move to a bigger apartment due to financial issues adds another layer. They can't easily resolve the space issue, so communication becomes key. The husband's reaction to feeling unwelcome might stem from feeling that his needs are not being considered. If the author is asking for time without considering his feelings or needs, that could be the problem. But if she's communicated her needs clearly and he's not meeting his obligations to find alternatives, maybe he's not helping.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because having personal space is a legitimate need, but she might not be addressing the emotional impact on her husband. However, the husband's reaction also seems immature and could be a sign that he's not respecting her needs. The key here is whether the author's request is reasonable and if there's a lack of mutual understanding. Since the husband is not working much and might feel neglected, the author might need to find a middle ground rather than just asking him to leave. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because her request is valid, but she might need to communicate better. The husband's reaction suggests he's not handling it well, so the author isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
