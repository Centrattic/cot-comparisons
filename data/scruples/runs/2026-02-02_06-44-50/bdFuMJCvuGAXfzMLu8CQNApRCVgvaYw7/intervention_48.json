I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a wife asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours on a Saturday afternoon. They live in a studio apartment with almost no alone time, and she wants some personal space. The husband feels hurt and doesn't want to be told to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is working full-time and values her alone time, which is important for mental health and personal space. The husband works less and spends a lot of time at home. When she asks him to leave, he feels unwelcome and gets hurt. The key points here are communication and mutual understanding. \n\nDoes the wife have a right to ask for some time alone? Yes, everyone needs personal space, especially in a small living situation. But the way she's doing it might be the issue. If she's not considering his feelings and just giving a time limit without discussing alternatives, that could be problematic. The husband's reaction might also stem from feeling like he's not part of the home, which is a valid feeling if he's been there for two years and it still doesn't feel like his place.\n\nThe husband's response of wanting exact hours and what to do outside might be a bit over the top, but his hurt feelings are real. The wife might not be considering how her request affects him emotionally. They need to find a middle ground, maybe suggesting activities he can do alone or together that are low-pressure. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards her not being in the wrong because she's expressing a legitimate need. However, the way she's handling it could be improved. The problem isn't just hers; communication issues are on both sides. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if the request is reasonable and if there's a lack of compromise.\n"
