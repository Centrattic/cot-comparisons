I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The husband feels hurt and doesn't feel welcome, while the author is trying to get some alone time because they live in a studio apartment with no privacy.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They value alone time and need space, which is understandable. Living in a studio, shared time is inevitable, but having some personal time is normal. The author works full-time; maybe they need to recharge. The husband works part-time and is home a lot, so maybe he's used to being around. But when the author asks for time alone, he gets hurt and wants specifics, which might indicate he's not comfortable setting boundaries or feels his freedom is restricted.\n\nThe husband's reaction: He says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home when asked to leave. That's a strong statement. If he's there all the time, maybe he hasn't adjusted to cohabiting with someone who needs personal space. The author isn't asking for constant separation, just a couple of hours here and there. The husband's response could stem from feeling that his presence is an imposition, or maybe he's not used to being alone either.\n\nFinancial constraints: They can't move due to his unstable job and high housing costs. So moving isn't an option right now. The author is trying to manage the current situation.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, communication is key here. The author is expressing a need for personal time, which is valid. However, the way they're asking might come across as dismissive of his feelings. Maybe they could find a middle ground, like specific times when they can have alone time without making him feel excluded. But the husband's reaction is also problematic because he's not being considerate of the author's needs. Both need to communicate better.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for wanting alone time, but they might need to approach it differently. The husband's hurt feelings are real, but he should also respect the author's need for space. It's a balance. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the husband's job situation is part of the problem, the author's request is reasonable. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
