I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about asking their husband to leave the studio apartment for a couple of hours to have alone time. \n\nFirst, the user mentions that they live in a studio apartment with no separate rooms, so when both are home, there's no privacy. The husband works part-time, so he's home a lot. The author wants some alone time, which they value, but when they ask him to leave, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. He also questions why he can't just come back later, even though he has free time on other days.\n\nThe key points here are the need for personal space versus the husband's feelings of being unwelcome. The author isn't asking for a long time, just a couple of hours. They also mention that the husband has time alone on other days, like Friday and Monday. The husband's reaction seems to be more about feeling excluded rather than the time itself. The author isn't doing anything wrong by seeking some alone time, especially in a shared living situation where privacy is limited. The husband's job instability and financial issues might add stress, but that doesn't mean the author's request is unreasonable. It's about balancing both partners' needs, and the author isn't at fault here.\n"
