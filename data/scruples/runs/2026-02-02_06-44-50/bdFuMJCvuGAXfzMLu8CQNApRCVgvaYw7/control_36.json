I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that she's in a studio apartment with her husband. They both work, but he works fewer hours, so he's home more. She wants some alone time and asked him to leave for a couple of hours, but he's hurt and feels unwelcome. She's trying to explain her need for privacy, but he's not getting it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is asking for personal space, which is a valid need. Studios are small, so it's hard to have alone time. She's working full-time, so maybe she's stressed and needs that time to recharge. But her husband feels like he's being asked to leave his own home, which is his place now. He might feel rejected or that his presence is a burden. His job is unstable, so maybe he doesn't have many social activities, making him rely on the home for relaxation.\n\nThe husband's reaction seems emotional. He's saying he doesn't feel welcome, which could indicate deeper issues. Maybe he's insecure or feels that his wife doesn't want him to be there. But the author isn't trying to kick him out; she just wants occasional alone time. The problem is communication. They need to find a balance that respects both their needs.\n\nThe author isn't being unreasonable by asking for time alone. It's a common need. The husband's reaction is more about how he's interpreting the request. He might need to understand that it's not a rejection but a need for personal time. However, the author might need to approach the request more carefully, maybe by suggesting specific activities he can do or compromising on the time.\n\nThey also mention the financial aspect. They can't move to a bigger place yet because of his job. So, the author has to deal with the current situation. She's not wrong in needing space, but maybe she could be more empathetic to his feelings. Perhaps finding other ways to create boundaries in the apartment, like setting up a small nook for her alone time without him leaving.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's request is reasonable, but the husband's feelings are valid too. The author isn't in the wrong for needing alone time, but she might need to communicate better. However, the question is whether she is in the wrong. Since she's asking for something reasonable and the husband is overreacting, maybe the answer is B (No). But I should check if there's any aspect where she's being selfish. She's not asking for a lot\u2014just a couple of hours. The husband's job situation is unstable, so maybe he's more dependent on the home environment. But that doesn't negate her need. So overall, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
