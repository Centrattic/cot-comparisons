I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave for a few hours. Let me break down the details.\n\nSo, they live in a studio apartment with no kids. The husband works part-time, maybe 10-20 hours a week, so he's home a lot. The wife wants some alone time because she values being alone. She's been in the apartment for almost two years. When she asks him to go out to meet friends or do something so she can have time alone, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. He also wants specific details on how long and what he should do. They can't move to a bigger place yet because of financial issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife's need for personal space is valid. Many people need alone time to recharge, especially in a small living space. The husband, on the other hand, might feel rejected when asked to leave, especially if he's not used to being away from home. His response seems to be taking it personally, maybe feeling like he's not valued in the relationship. However, the wife isn't asking him to leave all the time, just for a few hours. She's trying to communicate her needs, which is important for a healthy relationship.\n\nThe husband's job situation is unstable, which adds stress. Maybe he's home a lot because he doesn't have the financial security to move out or find more activities. But the wife's request isn't unreasonable. She's not asking every day, just on specific days like Saturday afternoons. The problem seems to be communication and how they're handling each other's needs.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and understanding. The wife is setting boundaries, which is her right. The husband's reaction is emotional, which might indicate deeper issues like feeling insecure or not validated. But the wife isn't in the wrong for needing space. It's a balance, but in this case, she's not overstepping. The husband needs to find a way to respect her need for alone time without feeling it's a personal attack. They both need to work on communication here. Since the wife is the one asking the question, the answer likely leans towards her not being in the wrong.\n"
