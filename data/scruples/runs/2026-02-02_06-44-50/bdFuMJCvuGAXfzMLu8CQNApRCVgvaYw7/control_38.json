I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for an answer between A and B, where A means the author is wrong and B means they're not.\n\nSo the situation is a studio apartment where both the author and her husband live. The main issue is that the author wants some alone time, so she asks her husband to leave for a couple of hours. The husband is hurt and feels unwelcome, which is causing tension. The author explains that the studio has no separate spaces, leading to constant togetherness. She values her alone time, especially since she works full-time and he works part-time. The husband's job is unstable, and they can't move to a bigger place yet because of financial issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid need for personal space. Living in a studio with someone else can make privacy hard. She's working full-time, which is demanding, and having alone time is important for her well-being. On the other hand, the husband's job is part-time and unstable, so he's home more often. He might feel like he's being pushed out of the home or not respected when she asks him to leave. His reaction seems to stem from feeling unwelcome, but maybe he's not processing the request correctly.\n\nIs the author wrong for asking? Well, she's not being abusive or unreasonable. She's asking for a few hours to herself, which is reasonable. The problem might be how the request is communicated or how he's reacting, not necessarily the request itself. The husband's response of feeling hurt and not understanding the request is part of the issue. The author's need for space is justified, especially in a small living situation. The husband's inability to find activities on his own could be a separate issue, but that doesn't make her request wrong. The fact that they can't move yet is a practical barrier, but that doesn't negate her need for alone time.\n\nSo the author is not in the wrong. She's advocating for her own needs in a shared living space, which is understandable. The husband's reaction is where the problem lies, not her request. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
