I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that she lives in a studio apartment with her husband and sometimes asks him to leave for a few hours so she can have alone time. The husband feels hurt and doesn't understand why she needs that time, especially since he's home a lot and she's working full time. The question is whether she's in the wrong for asking him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author values her alone time, which is understandable. Living in a small space with someone 24/7 can be stressful even if you love them. She mentions that she's used to living alone and that having space is important to her. It's reasonable for someone to want some personal time to relax, read, or do activities without the other person around. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband feels like he's not welcome in his own home. He's home a lot, works fewer hours, and when she asks him to leave, he takes it personally. He might feel like his presence is a burden or that he's being excluded. The fact that he's hurt suggests he might be feeling insecure about his role in the relationship or his place in the household. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author is trying to communicate her need for alone time, which is a legitimate request. However, the way the husband is reacting could indicate that he's not feeling heard or valued. If the author's requests are causing emotional distress to her husband, maybe there's a way to adjust how they handle this. But the core need for personal space is valid. \n\nThe husband's argument that he has plenty of free time might overlook the fact that his alone time isn't the same as quality time when they're both home. He might not have activities to fill his time, so being alone isn't relaxing for him. However, that doesn't negate the author's need for her own space. \n\nThe inability to move to a bigger apartment due to financial reasons complicates things. They can't solve the space issue immediately, so they have to manage their current living situation. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting a few hours to herself, but maybe both could work on finding a middle ground. For example, setting specific times for alone space without making the husband feel excluded, or finding activities they can do separately but still be in the same space. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for asking for alone time. It's a reasonable request given their living situation. The husband's feelings are valid too, but that doesn't make the author's actions wrong. They need better communication and compromise.\n"
