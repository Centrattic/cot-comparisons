I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she lives in a studio apartment with her husband. They don't have kids, and she works full-time while he works 10-20 hours a week. She wants some alone time, so she asks him to leave for a few hours on a Saturday afternoon. But when she does that, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. He also points out that he has free time on other days, like Friday and Monday, but she doesn't see that as a problem.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. She's in a small space, a studio apartment, which makes alone time hard. She values her privacy and alone time, which is understandable. She's trying to create that space for herself, which is a reasonable need. On the other hand, her husband feels that when she asks him to leave, it's like he's not welcome in his own home. He might feel that his presence is a burden or that he's being excluded. He also mentions his job situation is unstable, which adds stress. They can't move to a bigger place because of financial issues.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. She's asking for personal time, which is valid, but she might not be considering how her requests are affecting his feelings. He might feel that he's being asked to leave without a clear plan or that he's not being included in the household dynamics. The fact that he has friends he can meet, but they don't have time on Saturday, might be a problem because he's not able to find activities on his own. She could be more proactive in helping him find things to do, rather than just asking him to leave. However, her need for alone time is also legitimate.\n\nThe husband's reaction seems a bit exaggerated. He's home a lot already, and having him leave for a few hours on a Saturday doesn't take away from the time he has on other days. But his emotional response is significant. It's possible that deeper issues are at play, like feeling unappreciated or not having a sense of belonging in the home. They need to communicate better and find a middle ground. Maybe she can set clear expectations but also support him in finding activities. Alternatively, they could agree on specific times when they can have alone time without making him feel unwelcome.\n\nIn terms of whether she's in the wrong, it's a balance. She's not wrong for needing her space, but she might not be addressing his feelings adequately. However, since the question is whether she is in the wrong, and considering that her request is reasonable given the living situation, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong. The husband's reaction is more about his own feelings and possibly not enough self-initiative in finding activities. The answer would likely be B (No), but I need to check if there's any other angle where her actions are unreasonable.\n"
