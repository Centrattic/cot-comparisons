I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they live in a studio apartment with their husband, and the author sometimes wants alone time. The husband works part-time and is home a lot, so when the author asks him to leave for a few hours to have some time alone, he gets hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome. The author feels like they need that alone time because they value it and missed living alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's need for personal space is valid. In a studio apartment, it's hard to have privacy, so asking for a few hours alone isn't unreasonable. People need time to themselves to recharge, so the author isn't being selfish just because they want that.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's reaction is important. If he feels that being asked to leave means he isn't welcomed in the home, that's a problem. Maybe he's feeling neglected or not included. It's possible he's not getting enough alone time either, or maybe he's struggling with the dynamics of the living situation. But the author is also trying to maintain their own well-being by having some time alone. \n\nThe husband's job situation is unstable, and they can't move yet. The author isn't avoiding responsibilities here; the problem is about the current living conditions. The husband might be overreacting by equating being asked to leave with not being welcome, which could be a misunderstanding. The author is clear that they value being alone sometimes, but that doesn't mean they don't value their relationship.\n\nLooking at the responses, the author is trying to communicate their needs, which is healthy. The husband's reaction is more about feeling hurt, which suggests there might be deeper issues of communication or unmet needs on his side. The author isn't wrong for wanting time to themselves, especially in a situation where it's hard to get. The key here is that mutual understanding and compromise are needed, but the initial act of asking isn't inherently wrong.\n"
