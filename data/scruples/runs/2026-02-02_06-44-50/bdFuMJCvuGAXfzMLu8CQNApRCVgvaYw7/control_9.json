I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they live in a studio apartment, which is small and gives no alone time. The author works full-time, and her husband works part-time (10-20 hours a week). He's home a lot, doesn't go out much, and when she asks him to meet friends or leave so she can have some time, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. She wants to have a couple of hours alone on a Saturday, but he's not happy about it. They can't move to a bigger place yet because of financial instability.\n\nSo, the main points are the need for personal space versus the husband's feelings of being excluded. The author has a valid need for solitude, which is important for mental health. However, the husband's reaction seems to stem from feeling that his home isn't a place where he's welcome, even though he's the one living there. \n\nThe author isn't wrong in wanting alone time. It's reasonable to ask for some privacy, especially in a small living space. The husband's issue might be about not having enough social activities on his own, but that's more about his own habits. The author isn't making him go out; she's just asking for time to herself. The husband's response of feeling unwelcome is a bit extreme since he's home most of the time anyway. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they can't move yet due to financial reasons, so the situation is temporary. The husband's job situation is unstable, but that's beyond their control. The key here is communication. Both need to find a balance. But the act of asking for personal time isn't inherently wrong. It's a common issue in close living spaces, and the author isn't being unreasonable here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
