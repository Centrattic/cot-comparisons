I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation (AITA) is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. I need to analyze the scenario carefully.\n\nFirst, the couple lives in a studio apartment, which means there's no separate rooms. Both work, but the husband only works 10-20 hours a week, so he's home a lot. The author mentions that they both being home all the time means there's no alone time. The author values alone time and has always loved living alone. They want a few hours of privacy, especially on weekends. \n\nThe husband, however, gets hurt when asked to leave. He feels like he's not welcome in his own home. The author tries to set specific times, but the husband seems to take it personally, maybe because he's not used to being asked to leave. The author also points out that he has plenty of free time during the week, including days when he's home alone (like Friday and Monday), so the request on a Saturday afternoon seems reasonable. They can't move to a bigger place due to financial issues related to the husband's unstable job and expensive city living.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The author's need for personal space is valid. Living in a studio without privacy can be stressful. But the husband's reaction might stem from feeling that his presence is being rejected. Maybe he's not used to being away from others or he's anxious about being alone. It's possible he's not handling the request well, but the author's request itself is a normal boundary. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they're asking for a few hours of alone time, which is reasonable. The problem might be in the communication. The husband's hurt feelings suggest that the way the request is made or the emotional response is the issue. However, the author isn't wrong for wanting that time. The husband's job situation and their housing constraints are complicating things, but that doesn't make the author's request wrong. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their need for space, which is healthy. The husband's reaction is problematic, but the author's actions are justified.\n"
