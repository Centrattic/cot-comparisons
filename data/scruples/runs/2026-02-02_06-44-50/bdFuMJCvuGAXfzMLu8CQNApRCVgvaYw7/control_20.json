I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a couple of hours. They live in a studio apartment, which doesn't offer much privacy. The husband works part-time and isn't out much, so the author wants some alone time, but when she asks, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The user wants to know if the author is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author justifies needing alone time because the studio apartment lacks privacy. She mentions she values living alone and needs the space to relax. However, the husband is upset, feeling it's his home too, and questions the exact hours and activities he should do outside. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here.\n\nSo, considering both sides. The author has a legitimate need for personal space, which is important for mental health and well-being. But the husband's feelings of being unwelcome are also valid. The husband's job situation is unstable, which might contribute to his anxiety about time at home. The author is trying to balance her needs with their current living situation, which is challenging. They also can't move due to financial reasons. \n\nThe key here is mutual understanding. The author isn't being unreasonable by wanting alone time, especially in a cramped space. But the husband's reaction suggests he might be feeling insecure or unappreciated. However, the author's request is specific and temporary\u2014asking for a couple of hours on a Saturday. It's not about excluding him entirely but sharing space with boundaries. The husband's response of needing exact hours and being upset seems a bit disproportionate and possibly hurtful. The author's intention isn't to make him feel unwelcome but to have some time to herself. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, it's about communication and compromise. The author isn't in the wrong for having needs, but maybe she could communicate better. However, the husband's reaction is problematic. The main issue is the husband's inability to handle her need for space without feeling rejected. The author's actions are reasonable given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
