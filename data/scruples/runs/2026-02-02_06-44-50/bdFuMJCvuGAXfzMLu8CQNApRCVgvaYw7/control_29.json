I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether it's acceptable for her to ask her husband to leave the apartment for a couple of hours. \n\nFirst, the context: they live in a studio apartment, which is a small space with no separate rooms. The author values alone time a lot, which makes sense. She works full time, and her husband works 10-20 hours a week, so he's home more often. She wants some time alone, but when she asks him to leave, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The husband seems to feel that the apartment is hers and not his, even though he's been living there for two years. He's also resistant to meeting friends, which limits his options when she asks him to go out.\n\nThe author is asking if she's in the wrong for wanting this time. From my perspective, wanting personal space is a reasonable request. In a close living situation, especially a small one, both partners need time to themselves. The husband's reaction seems more about feeling like he doesn't belong in the home, which is a different issue. His job instability and financial situation might contribute to his feelings of insecurity, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong to want alone time. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author isn't asking for unreasonable time\u2014just a couple of hours. The problem seems to stem more from the husband's emotional response rather than the request itself. The author isn't being selfish; she's expressing her need, which is normal. The husband's feelings of not feeling welcome in his own home is a separate issue that needs addressing, perhaps through communication about how he can feel more at home while also respecting her need for space.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The issue is more about the husband's feelings and how he's handling the request. She has the right to ask for alone time, especially in a small space where it's hard to get it otherwise.\n"
