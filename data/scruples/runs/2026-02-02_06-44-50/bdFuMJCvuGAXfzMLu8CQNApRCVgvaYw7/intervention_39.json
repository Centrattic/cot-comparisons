I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The scenario is a studio apartment with both living together, leading to no alone time. The author needs some personal space, so she asks her husband to leave, but he feels hurt and unwelcome. They're considering moving later due to financial issues.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author has a valid need for alone time, especially since she works full-time and the apartment is small. Valuing personal space is normal. The husband, on the other hand, feels that the home isn't his, and his job is unstable. He might be sensitive because he doesn't have much social life and feels like his home is taken away from him.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual needs. The author's request for alone time isn't unreasonable, but the way she's handling it might be causing hurt. Maybe she hasn't considered alternative ways to get alone time without making him feel unwelcome. For example, using noise-canceling headphones, creating a separate space in the studio, or finding activities that can be done together but allow her some solitude. Also, the husband's reaction suggests deeper feelings of insecurity or not feeling at home, which might need addressing through open discussion rather than just asking him to leave.\n\nFinancial constraints are a factor too. They can't move yet, so they need to work with the current setup. The author might need to compromise by negotiating specific times when she can have alone time, ensuring he doesn't feel excluded. Maybe she can also plan activities where they can be together but not in the same room, or encourage him to find hobbies or social events to fill his time. The husband's job situation adds stress, so his need for a stable home environment is important too.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have needs that should be respected. The author isn't in the wrong for needing alone time, but perhaps she could approach the situation more collaboratively. The way she's asking might come across as dismissive of his feelings. So while her need is valid, the method might need adjustment. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with the idea that both need to communicate better and find a middle ground.\n"
