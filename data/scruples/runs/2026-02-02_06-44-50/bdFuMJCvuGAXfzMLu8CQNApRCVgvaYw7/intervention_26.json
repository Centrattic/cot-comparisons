I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours.\n\nFirst, the key points from the situation: They live in a studio apartment with no alone time. The author works full-time, and the husband works part-time (10-20 hours a week), so he's home a lot. The author values alone time and sometimes needs a few hours to themselves. When she asks the husband to leave, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The husband doesn't have many friends or a social life, so when she suggests he go out, he feels like he can't do that. The couple hasn't moved to a bigger place yet due to his unstable job and their city's housing issues.\n\nThe author is in a studio apartment, which is small. The husband is home a lot but maybe not as much as the author would like. She's asking for a few hours alone, which is reasonable. But the husband's reaction is hurt, feeling it's about him not being welcome. The author's request is about her need for personal time, which is valid. However, the husband's response is emotional, maybe because he doesn't have much social support or feels his home is being questioned. \n\nThe author might be in the right in needing personal space, but maybe the way she's handling it could be improved. She could consider alternatives, like finding activities they can do separately in the apartment, or encouraging the husband to build a social circle. But the core issue is that she's asking for time alone in a shared space, which is reasonable. The husband's job situation and lack of friends might contribute to his feelings of not having a relaxing time. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. She's justified in needing alone time, especially given their living situation. The husband's reaction might stem from his own issues, like feeling isolated. The author's request isn't unreasonable, so the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
