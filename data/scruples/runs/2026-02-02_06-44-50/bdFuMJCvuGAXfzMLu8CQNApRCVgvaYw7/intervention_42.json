I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. \n\nFirst, the context: They live in a studio apartment, so space is limited. The author works full-time, while the husband works only 10-20 hours a week. They don't have kids. The issue is the author wanting some alone time because being in the same small space all the time is affecting her. She's asked him to leave, but he gets hurt and feels unwelcome.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. I need to assess whether the author's actions are reasonable or not.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that she values alone time and can't get it with him around. She mentions that he's home a lot and has free time. The husband's reaction is emotional, feeling that the apartment isn't his, and gets specific about the hours and activities he should do. The user also mentions financial constraints preventing moving to a bigger place.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics: It's common for couples to need personal space. The author's request seems reasonable given the living situation. However, the way the husband reacts (feeling hurt, not welcomed, needing specifics) might indicate he's struggling with the request emotionally. But does that make the author in the wrong? Or is it a matter of communication issues and differing needs?\n\nThe key points here are mutual understanding and compromise. The author is asserting her need for alone time, which is valid. The husband's reaction suggests a possible insecurity or feeling of not being part of the home. But the author is not being unreasonable in her request. She's trying to balance her need for space with his presence. The fact that they don't have kids and he has a lot of free time adds to the situation. The author isn't asking him to leave all the time, just a couple of hours. \n\nFinancial issues might be a stressor, but that doesn't negate the author's need for alone time. It's possible that both need to communicate better about their expectations. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for asking for space. The husband's reaction might be where the issue lies more, in terms of handling the request sensitively.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because her request for personal time is reasonable given the circumstances, and the problem might be more about how the husband is reacting rather than the request itself.\n"
