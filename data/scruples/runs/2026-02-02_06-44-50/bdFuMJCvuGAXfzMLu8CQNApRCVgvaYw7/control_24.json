I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who is married, lives in a studio apartment with her husband. They don't have kids, and she's working full-time, while he works 10-20 hours a week. The problem is that the studio apartment doesn't give her any alone time because he's home a lot. She wants to have a few hours alone sometimes, so she asks him to leave for a couple of hours. But when she does that, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome in his own home. He also questions why she needs a specific amount of time and what he should do when his friends aren't available. She's frustrated because he's home alone on other days and she doesn't understand why he's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is valuing her need for personal space, which is understandable. Living in a small space with someone else can lead to feeling claustrophobic, especially if you're used to living alone. She mentions that she's always loved living alone and values that solitude. So, her request for some time alone is reasonable. However, she's also his home now, and he might be feeling that his presence is being rejected or that he's not part of the household after moving in two years ago. His reaction of feeling hurt and unwelcome suggests that he might have emotional needs too, maybe needing to feel connected and part of the home.\n\nThe husband's situation is that he's working fewer hours and doesn't have friends to meet often. So when the author asks him to go out, he might feel like he's being forced to socialize when he's not in the mood or lacks the social connections. Also, he's home alone on other days, like Friday and Monday, but maybe those times aren't structured or he prefers to be with her. The fact that he's feeling stressed about not having a relaxing weekend if he can't stay home on Saturday adds to the emotional load. He might be feeling that his needs for relaxation and companionship aren't being met.\n\nFinancial constraints are also a factor. They can't move to a bigger apartment because of his unstable job and high costs in the city. So, the author is in a tough spot between her need for space and the husband's emotional reaction. The question is whether her asking for a few hours alone is unreasonable. \n\nFrom a general perspective, it's normal for individuals to have different needs for personal space. The author isn't asking for a lot\u2014just a couple of hours on a Saturday afternoon. However, the way she's framing it might be making the husband feel like he's not accepted. Maybe the way she communicates her request could be improved, but the request itself isn't wrong. The husband's reaction, on the other hand, could be seen as more problematic if he's not open to compromise or understanding her needs. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she's expressing a valid need for alone time in a shared living situation, especially given the apartment's size, it's not inherently her fault. However, the situation might require better communication between both parties. The husband's feelings of not being welcome might stem from insecurity or fear of rejection, which he needs to address. The author isn't wrong for wanting space, but maybe there's room for both to express their needs more effectively. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She's advocating for her mental well-being and personal space, which is important. The husband's reaction points to his own emotional needs, but that doesn't mean the author is at fault. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
