I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, they live in a studio apartment, which is small and has no separate rooms. The author works full-time, while her husband works only 10-20 hours a week. He doesn't go out much or meet friends often. The author values alone time and sometimes wants to have a few hours to herself. When she asks him to leave, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome, even though she's just trying to get some personal space.\n\nThe husband lives in the apartment for almost two years but still doesn't feel it's his home. He's resistant to the author's requests, wanting exact hours and activities for when he needs to leave. The author points out that he has plenty of free time during the week, like Fridays and Mondays, but he's not using that time to go out. They can't move to a bigger place right now due to financial issues.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The author has a legitimate need for personal space, especially in a small living situation. It's common for people to require some alone time to recharge. The husband's reaction suggests he might feel his presence is being questioned or that he's not accepted in the home. However, the author isn't asking him to leave all the time, just for a couple of hours on specific days. The husband's job situation is unstable, but that doesn't mean he can't find activities or friends to engage with. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's request is reasonable. Since the husband is home a lot and the author needs some space, asking him to leave temporarily isn't unreasonable. The husband's emotional response might stem from insecurity or not feeling part of the home, but the author isn't at fault for needing her time. They also plan to move when his situation improves, which shows consideration for the future.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. Her request is about personal space, which is valid. The husband's hurt feelings might be more about his own insecurities or the living arrangement's pressures. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
