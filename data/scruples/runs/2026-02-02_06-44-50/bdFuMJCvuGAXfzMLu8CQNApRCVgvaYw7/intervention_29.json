I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she's living in a studio apartment with her husband. They don't have a lot of space, and she wants some time alone, which she can't get because he's around. She asks him to leave for a few hours, but he takes it as a rejection, feeling unwelcome in his own home. The user thinks she's in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, the studio apartment is a constraint. It's a small space, so alone time is hard. She works full-time, he works part-time. He's home more, so maybe he's used to being around. She values solitude, which is understandable. But when she asks him to leave, he feels hurt and maybe like he's not part of the home. That's a valid feeling too. Communication seems like an issue here. She wants time alone, but maybe she hasn't communicated her needs in a way that he understands without feeling rejected.\n\nHe's not meeting friends often, so when she suggests he go out, maybe he doesn't have the social connections to do that. If he's not used to being out, being asked to leave might feel like he's being pushed out. Also, he's home a lot on other days, but when she asks for specific time, he's upset. Maybe he's feeling that he doesn't get enough time at home, even though he's there more often. The fact that he's home on Friday and Monday but still wants a relaxing weekend might indicate that his perception of free time is different. He might need the weekends to relax, hence the conflict.\n\nRegarding the bigger apartment: They can't move because of financial instability. So it's not feasible right now. They're waiting for his job situation to improve. That's a real-life obstacle. She might be trying to manage her need for space given the current situation. But is asking him to leave for a few hours really the problem? Maybe she's not asking for much, but he's taking it personally. On the other hand, maybe she's not considering his feelings enough. She might need to find a middle ground, like suggesting activities he can do alone that don't involve friends, or setting up a specific time when he can have his own space during the week.\n\nThe key points are mutual understanding and communication. If she's not being inconsiderate but is expressing her needs, maybe it's not her fault. However, if her requests are causing emotional distress without considering his perspective, then there's room for her to adjust. The answer hinges on whether her request is reasonable given the circumstances and how it's communicated. Since she's trying to balance her needs with his, but the situation is causing hurt feelings, perhaps she's not entirely in the wrong. But maybe there's a way to approach it more sensitively. The answer is likely B, not in the wrong.\n"
