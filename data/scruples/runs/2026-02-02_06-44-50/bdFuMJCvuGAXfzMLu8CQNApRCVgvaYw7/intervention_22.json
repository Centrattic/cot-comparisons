I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple living in a studio apartment where the wife (author) wants some alone time and asks her husband to leave for a few hours. The husband reacts hurt, feeling unwelcome, and the author is unsure if her request is justified.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author values alone time because they live in a small space. It's a studio, so privacy is limited. She mentions she works full-time, and he works part-time, so he's home a lot. She wants some time alone, which isn't unusual. But when she asks him to leave, he feels hurt and questions the exact hours and activities. \n\nThe husband's perspective is that he moved into her apartment almost two years ago, so maybe he still feels it's not his space. His job is unstable, and he doesn't go out much. When she asks him to meet friends or leave, he feels rejected. He's also pointing out that she's not giving him clear guidelines, which might make him feel like she's using him as a means to get alone time rather than considering his feelings.\n\nThe author thinks she might be in the wrong, but I need to see if her request is reasonable. People need alone time, especially in a small living space. However, communication is key. If the husband feels that being asked to leave is a rejection, maybe the author needs to find a better way to communicate her needs without making him feel unwelcome. Maybe she's not wrong in wanting alone time, but her approach might be causing hurt feelings. \n\nAlso, considering their financial situation, moving to a bigger apartment isn't an option right now. So they need to work with what they have. The husband's job instability adds another layer\u2014maybe he's stressed about his job, which makes him more sensitive about his living situation.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, wanting alone time isn't wrong. But the way she's handling it might be. If she's not considering his feelings and making him feel like he's not part of the home, that's a problem. The husband's reaction is valid because he's feeling hurt and unvalued. The author might need to find a middle ground, like setting specific times for alone time and ensuring he understands it's not about rejection but her need for space. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong for wanting alone time, but her approach could be improved. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. If the answer is B (not in the wrong), because her needs are valid, but she needs better communication. Alternatively, if the answer is A, it's because she's not considering his feelings enough. \n\nBut given the context, the author's request is reasonable, and the husband's reaction is about feeling excluded. The core issue is communication and mutual understanding. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting alone time, but maybe the way she's asking is causing the problem. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
