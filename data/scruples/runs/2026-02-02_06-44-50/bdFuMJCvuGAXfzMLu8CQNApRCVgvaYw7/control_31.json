I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the situation) is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a couple of hours. They live in a studio apartment, which is a small space. The husband works part-time and spends a lot of time at home. The author wants some alone time because they value that and loved living alone before. They tried to ask the husband to go out to meet friends or do something, but he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The author is considering moving to a bigger place but can't due to financial issues.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author has a valid need for alone time, which is important for mental health and personal space. Living in a studio with someone else can be challenging for that. The husband, on the other hand, works part-time and might not have a strong social circle, so being asked to leave might feel like he's being rejected. His hurt feelings are real, and he might feel like the apartment isn't truly his home yet. \n\nThe key points are communication and mutual understanding. The author's request is reasonable, but the way it's presented might be an issue. When they ask for specific hours and activities, it can make the husband feel like he's being monitored or not trusted. The author might not be considering the husband's feelings and social limitations. However, the husband also needs to work on adapting to shared living and finding ways to manage his time. \n\nFinancial constraints are a real problem, so moving isn't an immediate option. Both need to find a middle ground. Maybe the author can set clearer boundaries without making the husband feel like he's not part of the home. Perhaps they can negotiate specific times for alone space and activities the husband can do independently. The husband might need to build a social network to have options when asked. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting alone time, but their approach could be adjusted. The husband's reaction is also valid because he feels hurt. It's a communication issue rather than one person being entirely wrong. So the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong (B), but there's room for improvement in how they handle the situation.\n"
