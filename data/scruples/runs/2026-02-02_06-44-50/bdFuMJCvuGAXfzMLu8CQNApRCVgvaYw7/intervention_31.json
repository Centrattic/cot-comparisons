I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple living in a studio apartment, and the author wants some alone time by asking her husband to leave for a few hours. She explains their living situation, the husband's limited work hours, and the challenges they face in moving to a bigger place due to financial instability. The husband reacts hurt when she asks him to leave, feeling unwelcome in his own home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author values alone time and has a valid reason. Studio apartments inherently have limited space, so having alone time can be challenging. However, the husband's reaction seems to be about feeling excluded. Maybe he's struggling with the idea of not being part of her space. It's possible that communication issues are at play here. The husband's job situation is unstable, which might affect his emotional state, making him more sensitive to being asked to leave.\n\nThe author isn't unreasonable in wanting some personal time. It's common for people to need that, especially after working full time. But the way the husband perceives the request might be a problem. If he feels that being asked to leave a few hours on a Saturday means he's not welcome in his home, there might be deeper issues, like a lack of established territory or emotional security. The author might not be considering his feelings enough when making the request, perhaps not framing it as a mutual need but rather as a personal necessity without addressing his feelings of exclusion.\n\nAlso, the husband's response about needing specific hours and activities might be a way to feel in control, which could indicate that he's not handling the request well. The author's argument about him having plenty of free time is valid, but maybe he feels that his time is being restricted in a way that isn't fair. There's a balance between personal space and mutual respect. The author's need for alone time is legitimate, but if the husband feels that his presence is always required, there's a disconnect in their expectations.\n\nI think the key here is communication. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting alone time, but perhaps she could approach the situation with more sensitivity and discussion about both their needs. However, the husband's reaction seems excessive. It's possible that the husband isn't handling the request well, but the author isn't entirely wrong either. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I need to decide if her actions are unreasonable. Given that she's trying to manage her need for space in a tight living situation and the husband's job instability adds to his stress, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. But the husband's hurt feelings and the way he frames the request as a rejection might indicate that he's not being considerate of her needs. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she has a valid reason for wanting alone time, and the husband's reaction seems more about his own feelings of being excluded rather than her being unreasonable. However, there's room for both to improve communication. But according to the options given, the correct answer is B.\n"
