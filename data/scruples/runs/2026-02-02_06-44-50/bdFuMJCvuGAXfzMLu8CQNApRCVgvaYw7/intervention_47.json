I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The scenario is a studio apartment with no privacy, and the husband works part-time. The wife wants some alone time, but the husband feels unwelcome when she asks him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife values alone time, which is understandable, especially in a small living space. She works full-time, so maybe she's stressed and needs some personal time. On the other hand, the husband feels hurt because he's moving in with her and wants to feel at home. He's working less hours, so maybe he's home more, but when she asks him to leave, he feels excluded.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. Is asking for a few hours of alone time unreasonable? In a studio apartment, privacy is limited, but expecting someone to leave entirely might be a lot. However, the husband's reaction seems to be about feeling unwelcome. Maybe the wife could have approached it differently, like suggesting activities he could do alone instead of just asking him to leave. Also, the husband's part-time job situation might mean he's home more, so maybe he's used to having the space. But if he doesn't have a job that requires him to be out, maybe he's not used to being active in his free time.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The wife might not have communicated her needs clearly or maybe the frequency of these requests. If she's asking every weekend, that could be a problem. But if it's occasional, it's reasonable. The husband's response of getting hurt and wanting specific hours might indicate he's not comfortable with the request. Maybe the wife could have discussed this earlier rather than waiting two years. Also, the husband's part in not finding ways to occupy himself when she needs space could be a factor.\n\nConsidering the housing situation, they can't move yet due to financial reasons. The wife might feel trapped between her need for space and their current living situation. But the husband's feelings are valid too. It's a balance between personal needs and partnership. The wife isn't in the wrong for needing alone time, but perhaps the way she's handling it is causing tension. Maybe there's a middle ground, like setting a time together and then alone time, or finding activities they can do separately in the apartment. The key is mutual understanding and finding solutions that respect both needs. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong, but there's room for better communication and compromise. Hence, answer B.\n"
