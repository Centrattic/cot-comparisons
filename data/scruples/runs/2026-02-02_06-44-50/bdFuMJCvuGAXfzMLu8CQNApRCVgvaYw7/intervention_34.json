I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman living in a studio apartment with her husband and wanting some alone time by having him leave for a couple of hours. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author wants personal space, which is understandable, especially in a small living space. She mentions she works full-time, and he works part-time. She values alone time, which is a legitimate need. On the other hand, the husband seems to feel that being asked to leave makes him unwelcome in his own home. His emotional reaction is significant here.\n\nThe key points to analyze: Is asking for alone time unreasonable in a shared living situation? The husband's response is hurtful, implying he doesn't feel it's his home. That suggests he might be feeling insecure or not fully integrated into the living arrangement. However, the author's need for personal space isn't unreasonable either. The husband having a lot of free time (home on Fridays, Mondays) might mean he has the capacity to be away for a few hours. But his emotional reaction complicates things.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. However, from a fairness standpoint, the husband's reaction might be more about feeling disrespected rather than the time itself. The author's request for specific hours and activities could be seen as controlling, but it's also about setting boundaries. \n\nIn relationships, both partners' needs should be considered. The author's need for alone time is valid, but the husband's feelings of being unwelcome aren't addressed constructively. Perhaps communication issues play a role here. The husband's job instability and housing situation add context but don't excuse his hurtful response. The author's actions might not be wrong, but there's room for better communication. Given that the author is seeking a balance in shared living, and the husband's reaction is more about feeling excluded, the responsibility isn't entirely on her. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong), as her request for personal space is reasonable, and the husband's reaction is more about his emotional response than the request itself. However, there's a need for mutual understanding and better communication on both sides.\n"
