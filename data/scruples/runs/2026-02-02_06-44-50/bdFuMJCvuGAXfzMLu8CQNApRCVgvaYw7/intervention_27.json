I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is asking her husband to leave the studio apartment for a couple of hours so she can have some alone time. The husband is getting hurt and feels unwelcome. The author feels that the husband is home a lot and has time to himself during the week, but when she asks for some time alone on the weekend, he's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living situation. A studio apartment is small, so privacy is limited. The author works full-time, and her husband works part-time, meaning he's home more. The author values alone time, which is normal for some people. But when she asks, he reacts negatively, saying he doesn't feel welcome. \n\nI wonder if the problem is communication. The husband might feel that whenever he's home, he's expected to be with the author, even if he's in a different room. Maybe he also needs alone time but hasn't communicated that. The author is trying to get her needs met, but the husband's reaction is hurt feelings, which suggests his needs aren't being met as well.\n\nThe author is asking him to leave for a few hours each time, which could be reasonable if he's available. But the husband feels like the home isn't his, which might indicate deeper issues. Maybe he feels like he's not part of the household if he's asked to leave regularly. The author might not be considering his feelings or the fact that he's home a lot and might also need space, but in a different way.\n\nAlso, the husband's job is unstable, and they can't move yet, so they're stuck in a situation where space is limited. The author might be trying to manage her own mental health by having time alone, which is important. However, the way she's approaching it\u2014asking for specific hours and maybe not acknowledging his feelings\u2014could be part of the problem.\n\nIs the author wrong for wanting alone time? Probably not. Everyone needs space. But maybe she's not handling it the best way. The husband's reaction is emotional, which might be a communication issue. The problem might be that they haven't found a balanced solution yet. The author could be more empathetic to his feelings when asking for time alone, but she's not necessarily in the wrong for needing that time. The husband's hurt feelings might be valid if he feels his presence is unwelcome. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she's asking for reasonable time alone without being dismissive of his needs, maybe she's not at fault. However, the husband's reaction suggests that his needs aren't being met, so maybe there's a mutual issue here. The key point is whether her request is unreasonable. If he has the time and can leave without working, then asking for a couple hours isn't unreasonable. But the husband's feelings are valid too. \n\nIn conclusion, maybe neither is entirely in the wrong, but the author isn't wrong for wanting alone time. The problem is more about how they communicate and balance each other's needs. So the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
