I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment, which doesn't offer much privacy. The husband works part-time and doesn't go out often, so he's home a lot. The author values alone time and sometimes wants to have the place to herself, but when she asks, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. They're considering moving because of the husband's unstable job and housing costs in the city.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid need for personal space, especially since they're in a small living area. It's common for people to want solitude, especially after work. But the husband's reaction is a problem. He's taking her request as him not being welcome, which might stem from feeling like he's not part of the home yet. Maybe he's struggling with the transition into the new living situation. \n\nThe husband's job situation is unstable, and they can't move yet. This might contribute to his stress, making him more sensitive. Also, he's home a lot, but if he's not socializing much, maybe he's relying on his partner for interaction. The author's request for alone time could be seen as reducing that interaction, which he's not handling well.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions are reasonable. Asking for a few hours alone isn't unreasonable, especially in a cramped space. However, the husband's reaction and interpreting it as not being welcome might be his issue. The author isn't being cruel; she's expressing a need for personal time. The problem seems more on the husband's side in how he's reacting, but the author could also communicate better. However, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. \n\nSo, based on the information, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting her space. The husband's feelings of being unwelcome are his own reaction, not her fault. The answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
