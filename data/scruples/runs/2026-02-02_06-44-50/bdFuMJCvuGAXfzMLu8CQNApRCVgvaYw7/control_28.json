I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment, which is small, and she wants some alone time. The husband works part-time and doesn't go out much, so he's home a lot. When she asks him to leave, he feels hurt and thinks it's not fair. The user wants to know if she's wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is trying to get some personal space, which is a reasonable need. People need time to themselves, especially in a small living space. But the husband is feeling that he's being asked to leave his own home, which he's contributing to. The fact that he's part of a shared home might make him feel that his presence is an issue. \n\nThe author mentions that he's home alone a lot and has free time. She's not asking for a long time, just a few hours on a Saturday. The husband's reaction seems to be about feeling unwelcome, which is a valid emotional response. He might feel that his partner isn't valuing his presence or considering his feelings. \n\nLooking at their situation: they can't move yet due to financial reasons. The author is working full-time, which is demanding. The husband's job is unstable, which might add to his stress. He might not have many outlets, so being asked to leave could exacerbate his feelings of being left out or not part of the household.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, wanting alone time isn't inherently wrong. But the way she's approaching it might need some adjustment. Maybe she's not considering his feelings enough. The husband's reaction is about feeling rejected, which is a real issue. The author could be in the right in needing space, but maybe she's not communicating it effectively. The key here is mutual understanding. If she's only looking at her needs and not his, that's a problem. \n\nThe husband needs to feel that he's part of the home and that his partner isn't constantly pushing him out. The author might need to find other ways to get alone time, like setting boundaries without asking him to leave, or encouraging him to find activities that he enjoys. They might need to compromise. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because needing personal space is normal, but she might be disregarding her husband's feelings. The answer might be a balance, but according to the options given, the answer is B (not in the wrong). However, the situation is complex and both have valid points. Since the question asks if she's in the wrong, and the options are A or B, I think the answer leans towards B because her needs are legitimate, but there's room for better communication.\n"
