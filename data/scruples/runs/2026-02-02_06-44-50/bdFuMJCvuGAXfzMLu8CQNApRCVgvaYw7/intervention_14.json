I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple living in a studio apartment where the wife asks her husband to leave for a few hours so she can have alone time. The husband feels hurt and doesn't understand why she needs that time, especially since he's home a lot already. The user thinks the author (the wife) is in the wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife values her alone time, which is something many people need for mental health and personal space. A studio apartment has no separate rooms, so even if they're in different areas, they're still in the same space. The husband works part-time and doesn't go out much, so he's home a lot. When she asks him to leave, he feels unwelcome. \n\nThe key points here are about communication and mutual understanding. The wife has a legitimate need for alone time, which is normal. However, the way she's asking him to leave might not be communicated in a way that respects his feelings. The husband's reaction seems to stem from feeling like the home isn't his, which could be due to the living situation (studio apartment) and his part-time job. He might feel insecure or not part of the home environment yet. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is wrong, but maybe the issue is more about both sides needing to adjust. The wife needs space, and the husband needs validation that he's part of the home. The problem might not be who's in the wrong but how they're handling the communication. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the husband is getting hurt and the wife isn't considering his feelings, maybe there's room for her to approach the situation more empathetically. But if he's being unreasonable and not respecting her need for space, then she's not in the wrong. \n\nLooking at the details: The wife is working full-time, which is demanding. She's asking for a couple of hours on a Saturday afternoon, which is reasonable. The husband's issue seems to be about not feeling included or being given specific times and tasks, which might be his way of feeling insecure. The fact that he can't go out because his friends are busy doesn't mean he can't do other things alone. The wife's request is about her need, which is valid. \n\nBut maybe the husband's reaction is overreacting. However, if he's feeling that he's not welcome, that's a valid emotion too. The crux is whether asking to have alone time is unreasonable. In a shared living space, especially a studio, both partners need to balance their needs. The wife isn't asking for the entire weekend, just a couple of hours on a Saturday. That seems reasonable. \n\nThe husband's problem with specifying the number of hours and what he should do might be a way of feeling like he's being sent away, which is a common issue in cohabiting couples. The wife might need to find a way to communicate her needs without making him feel unwelcome. Perhaps suggesting activities he can do alone or finding a compromise. \n\nIn terms of fault, the wife isn't wrong for needing and asking for alone time. It's a normal request. The husband's reaction is more about his feelings of not belonging, which might stem from other issues like the instability of his job and the living situation. So the fault isn't entirely on the wife. However, the way she's approaching it (asking him to leave) might need a more sensitive approach. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nThe user initially thinks she is, but considering the context, her request is reasonable. The husband's feelings are important too, but the wife isn't in the wrong for wanting alone time. They both need to adjust and communicate better. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
