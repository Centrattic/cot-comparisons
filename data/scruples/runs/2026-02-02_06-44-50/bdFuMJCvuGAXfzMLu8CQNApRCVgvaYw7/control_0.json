I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment, so space is limited. The author works full-time, and the husband works part-time, so he's home more often. The author wants some alone time, which is understandable. But when they ask the husband to leave, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author wants personal space, which is a valid need. Living in a small space with someone else can make that hard. But the husband is clearly feeling that his presence is an issue, and when asked to leave, he feels like he's not part of the home. That's a sensitive issue. \n\nThe husband's job situation is unstable, and they can't move to a bigger place right now. So he's home a lot, maybe not having much social interaction. The author is asking him to go out with friends, but when he can't, he feels like the author isn't giving him a proper home. There's a communication problem here. The husband might be feeling isolated, and the author's request could be triggering that. \n\nThe key points are that the author's need for alone time is reasonable, but the husband's emotional response is also valid. The author isn't being cruel, but maybe the way they're communicating their needs is causing hurt. The husband's feeling that he's not part of the home is a red flag. Maybe the author should find a middle ground, like setting specific times for alone time rather than asking him to leave entirely. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the need for alone time is legitimate, the author isn't entirely wrong. However, the husband's feelings need to be addressed. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because they're expressing a need, but they need to communicate better. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
