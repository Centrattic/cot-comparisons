I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThey live in a studio apartment, which is small, so no alone time when both are home. The author works full-time, and her husband works part-time, about 10-20 hours a week. That means he's home a lot. The author wants some time alone, maybe to read or watch something, but she's not blocking him from doing activities; he's just not going out much or meeting friends. When she asks him to leave for a few hours on a Saturday, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. He wants specific details on how long and what he should do. The author thinks he has plenty of free time already, like on Fridays and Mondays, but he's upset because they're going on a day trip on Sunday, and he feels he can't relax otherwise.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. Let me consider both sides. The author has a right to some alone time, especially since she's working full-time. The husband's job is unstable, so maybe he feels insecure or doesn't have a strong social circle. He's home a lot and might feel the apartment isn't his, leading to resentment. The author's request is reasonable, but the way it's being framed might hurt his feelings. He might feel rejected or like he's not valued. The author might not be considering his emotional needs, but she's trying to balance her own need for space. The husband's reaction seems extreme given he has other free days, but maybe his low income and unstable job contribute to low self-esteem. \n\nIs the author wrong? She's not being abusive; she's asking for a few hours alone. The problem is communication and mutual understanding. Maybe they need to discuss their needs better. But the husband's reaction might be a sign of deeper issues, like insecurity or feeling the apartment isn't his. The author's perspective is valid, but if the husband feels unwelcome, that's a problem. However, the core issue is the lack of personal space in a small living arrangement. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting alone time, especially since she's working full-time. The husband's reaction is an issue, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong for making the request. So the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
