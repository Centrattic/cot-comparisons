I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The main issue is that the author wants some alone time and has asked her husband to leave the apartment for a couple of hours, but he's taking it personally.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author lives in a studio apartment with her husband, which means there's no space for privacy. She works full-time, and he works fewer hours, so he's home more. She values alone time and sometimes needs to read or watch shows by herself. But when she asks him to leave for a few hours, he feels hurt and unwelcome. He also questions how many hours she needs and what he should do during that time. The husband feels that his home isn't welcoming, and the author is confused because he has free time on other days.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and communication. The author wants her space, which is a reasonable need, especially in a small living situation. However, the way she's asking for time alone might not be communicated effectively. The husband's reaction suggests he feels his presence is being rejected, which can be emotionally hurtful. It's possible that the author didn't explain her need for alone time clearly or validate his feelings.\n\nAlso, considering the living situation: they can't move to a bigger place right now due to financial constraints. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting a solution that works within their current circumstances. But maybe she could approach the request differently, like discussing it without making it seem like a demand. The husband's feelings are valid too; he might feel isolated if he's not used to being alone.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If she's reasonable with her requests and communicates her need for alone time without making him feel unwelcome, then she's not wrong. However, if she's not considering his feelings or the way she's phrasing her requests is causing hurt, then there's room for her to adjust. The answer likely hinges on whether her actions are respectful and considerate of his emotions. Given the context, it seems like both need to work on communication, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting her space.\n"
