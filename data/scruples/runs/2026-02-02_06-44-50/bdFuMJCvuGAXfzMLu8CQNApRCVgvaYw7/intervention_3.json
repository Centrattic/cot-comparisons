I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a person living in a studio apartment with their husband. She wants some alone time, so she asks him to leave for a couple of hours. But he takes it personally, feeling unwelcome in his own home. The user is asking if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author mentions that the studio apartment has no privacy, and they're both home a lot. She works full-time, he works part-time. She values alone time, which is understandable. She's not saying he should leave every day, but sometimes on weekends. However, when she asks, he gets hurt and wants specifics. That seems like a possible issue in communication. Maybe he's not handling the request well, but is she in the wrong for making the request?\n\nThe husband's perspective is that he doesn't have a relaxing weekend if he can't be home on Saturday. But he's home alone on Friday and Monday too. The author argues he has enough free time. Maybe he's feeling like she's not considering his need for relaxation in the home. He might feel like the apartment is hers more, given he moved in 2 years ago and it still doesn't feel like his. \n\nThe key point is whether asking for a few hours alone is unreasonable. The author is in a studio apartment where privacy is limited. People do need personal space, so her request isn't unreasonable. However, the way he reacts could be a problem in communication. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If her request is reasonable, and he's overreacting, then she's not in the wrong. But if she's being too demanding, maybe she is.\n\nThe husband's job is unstable, and they can't move yet. So maybe he's more sensitive about his time at home. However, the author is asking for a specific time, not constant absence. The problem might be that he's not finding a middle ground, like suggesting other activities. But the author's request is valid. So probably the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
