I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple living in a studio apartment. The author wants some alone time and asks her husband to leave for a few hours, but he feels hurt and unwelcome. The husband works part-time (10-20 hours a week) and doesn't go out much. The author works full-time, so she's home more often. They don't have kids.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: She values alone time and the apartment is a studio, so no privacy. She's trying to get some personal space by asking him to leave. She's not asking for a lot\u2014just a couple of hours. The husband's reaction is that he doesn't feel welcome in his own home, which is a big emotional response. He seems to take it personally, maybe because he's not used to the apartment still feeling like hers, and he's not as active socially. He might feel neglected or like he's not part of the home.\n\nBut then, the husband's job situation is unstable, and they can't afford a bigger place. He might have feelings of insecurity about his role in the relationship, especially if he's not working full-time and feels like he's not contributing as much. His job instability could contribute to his sensitivity. Also, he might be struggling with social isolation because he doesn't have many friends or activities, so when the author suggests he go out, it's hard for him to find things to do.\n\nThe author is asking for a specific time (Saturday afternoon) and the husband seems to take it as being kicked out, even though he has other days free (like Friday and Monday). The author might be underestimating his feelings of exclusion, especially if he's not used to being in a committed relationship where he might need to adjust to shared space. On the other hand, she's also trying to maintain her own mental health and space, which is important.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It depends on the balance of their needs. If she's asking for reasonable time to herself and he's overreacting, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if she's not considering his feelings or the reasons behind his reaction, maybe she could be more understanding. However, in a relationship, both partners should have needs. The key issue is communication. She's trying to communicate her need for space, which is valid, but he's feeling hurt, which also needs to be addressed. The fact that he's not used to the apartment feeling like his home might play a role. It's a two-way problem. They need to find a middle ground, but asking for a couple of hours isn't inherently wrong. The husband's reaction seems extreme given that he has other days free. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
