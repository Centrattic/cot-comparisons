I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a couple of hours. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. They live in a studio apartment, which is a small space with no separate rooms. Both work, but the husband works fewer hours and isn't going out much. The author wants some alone time, which is understandable. They mention that they value privacy and living alone, but now they're in a shared space. The husband, however, feels hurt and doesn't feel welcome when asked to leave. He seems to be taking it personally, even when the author just wants some time to themselves.\n\nThe author is trying to communicate their need for personal space, which is a valid request. But the husband's reaction is problematic. He's not meeting friends often and has a lot of free time, as mentioned. The author is not asking for an unreasonable amount of time, just a couple of hours. The husband's response of wanting exact hours and what he should do outside seems like a way to avoid addressing the issue or maybe a defense mechanism because he feels rejected.\n\nNow, considering the options: A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. The author's desire for alone time isn't unreasonable, especially in a small living space. The key here is the husband's reaction and his tendency to take it personally. The author is trying to communicate their needs, which is healthy in a relationship. The husband's feelings of not being welcome might stem from insecurity or not feeling included. But the author isn't at fault for wanting space. The husband should perhaps work on his reaction and understand the author's needs. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they can't move to a bigger place due to financial reasons. So, they have to manage within the current situation. The author's request isn't a regular occurrence but rather a specific time (like a Saturday afternoon), which the husband seems to be overreacting to. The fact that the husband has free time on other days (Friday and Monday) but still feels upset might indicate his issue isn't with the time itself but with feeling excluded. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're expressing a need for personal space, which is reasonable. The problem lies in the husband's response and his inability to handle the request without feeling rejected. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
