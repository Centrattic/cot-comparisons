I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple living in a studio apartment where the author wants some alone time and has asked their husband to leave for a few hours. The husband is hurt and feels unwelcome, and they can't move to a bigger place due to financial issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author works full-time and values alone time, which is important for mental health. Studio apartments do offer very little privacy. On the other hand, the husband works part-time and feels excluded. He's in the home most of the time, so maybe he's used to being around each other constantly. The author is asking him to leave, which he perceives as not making him feel at home. \n\nThe husband's reaction seems extreme because he's home a lot and has the option to go out but doesn't. However, the author's need for personal space is also valid. They mentioned that the husband can't meet friends often, so maybe he's not used to being out. The author isn't asking for the entire weekend, just a few hours on Saturday. The husband is getting defensive, which might be because he's feeling insecure about his role or place in the relationship. \n\nThe key points are mutual understanding. The author isn't being unreasonable in wanting some time alone, but perhaps the way they're asking might be coming off as dismissive. The husband's reaction shows he's hurt, so communication might be an issue. The author could try to explain their needs more clearly and maybe find compromises, like suggesting activities the husband can do alone or with friends. However, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for needing their space. It's a common issue in shared living, especially in small spaces. The husband might need to take some initiative to engage more outside the home. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid need for personal time, and the issue lies more in how they're communicating it and the husband's response. The husband's feelings are important, but the author's request is reasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
