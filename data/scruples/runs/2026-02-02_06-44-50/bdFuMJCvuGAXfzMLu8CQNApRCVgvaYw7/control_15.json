I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The context is a studio apartment with no alone time, and the husband works part-time.\n\nFirst, the author wants some personal time, which is understandable. Living in a small space without privacy can be stressful. They mention needing to read or watch shows alone, which is a reasonable request. The husband's reaction seems hurt, saying he doesn't feel welcome. But the author points out that he has plenty of alone time during the week when they're not both home. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect for each other's need for space. The author is not asking for the entire weekend, just a couple of hours on Saturday. The husband's issue with specifying exact hours and activities might be an overreaction. Also, the author's situation is a valid need for personal space, especially considering they've lived together for two years without kids. \n\nFinancial constraints and job stability are mentioned, so moving isn't an option right now. The husband's job situation is unstable, but that doesn't negate the author's need for alone time. The husband's reaction seems more about feeling unwelcome rather than the actual request. \n\nIn relationships, it's normal to have needs for personal space. The author isn't being selfish; they're trying to balance their own needs with their partner's. The husband's hurt feelings might stem from insecurity or not feeling included, but the author's request is reasonable. \n\nSo, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. They have a valid reason, and the husband's reaction is more about his emotional response than the request itself.\n"
