I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours in their studio apartment. They mention that they need alone time because they value it, but the husband feels hurt and doesn't see why he can't be home. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has a valid need for personal space, especially working full-time and living in a small space. They mention that their husband works less and is home a lot, which might contribute to the lack of alone time. It's normal for people to need some privacy, and they're not asking for a huge amount of time, just a couple of hours.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband feels that he isn't welcome in his own home. He might feel that his presence is being rejected, especially if he doesn't have many social outlets. The fact that he's been in the apartment for two years and it doesn't feel like his home yet could indicate he's still adjusting or not fully comfortable. His reaction seems hurtful, and he's not able to understand why the request is necessary, which might point to a communication issue between them.\n\nLooking at the reasons given for not moving to a bigger place, financial instability and job insecurity are factors. So the immediate solution isn't feasible, making the current situation something they need to navigate. The author's request seems reasonable as it's just a few hours of time for themselves, not a refusal to be together constantly. The husband's response, however, seems more about feeling unappreciated or not accepted in the relationship.\n\nI think the key here is whether the request is unreasonable. The author isn't asking for days or anything, just a couple of hours. The husband's reaction is more about his feelings of being unwelcome, which might be a deeper issue. The author isn't wrong in wanting space; it's a common human need. The husband's response is problematic because he's taking it personally and not considering the author's need for alone time. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
