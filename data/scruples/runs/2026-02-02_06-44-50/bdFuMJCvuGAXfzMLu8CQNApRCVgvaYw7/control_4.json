I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThey live in a studio apartment, which means no alone time when both are home. The author works full time, while her husband works 10-20 hours a week. He doesn't go out much or meet friends, so he's usually home when she is. She wants some alone time, so she asks him to leave for a few hours on weekends. But when she does, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. He wants specific details on how long and what he should do. They can't move to a bigger place yet because of his unstable job and expensive housing. \n\nFirst, I should consider both perspectives. The author has a valid need for personal space. Living in a studio apartment with someone else can be challenging for alone time, especially if one person works less. She's not avoiding him, just wanting time to herself. But her husband feels like he's not welcome in his own home. He might be sensitive about being asked to leave, especially if he's already spending a lot of time home alone. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual needs. The author is trying to balance her need for space with their living situation. She\u2019s not asking for a huge chunk of time, just a couple of hours on a Saturday. The husband's reaction seems to stem from feeling unvalued or maybe neglected. However, his argument about having free time on other days (like Friday and Monday) might be a valid counterpoint. \n\nThe husband's job situation is unstable, so maybe moving isn't an option right now. But the author is trying to make the best of their current circumstances. It's possible that the husband's feelings are hurt because he feels like the author isn't considering his need for companionship or that he's trying to spend time with her. However, the author's need for solitude is also important for her well-being. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because asking for personal space is reasonable. The issue might be in how the request is communicated. If the husband feels unappreciated, maybe there's a communication gap. The author could try to reassure him that she still wants to spend time with him, just also needs some alone time. But the act of asking to be left alone isn't inherently wrong. The husband's reaction might be disproportionate, given that he has plenty of free time. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They're trying to balance their needs in a difficult living situation, and it's not unreasonable to ask for some time alone.\n"
