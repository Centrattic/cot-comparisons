I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a wife asking her husband to leave the studio apartment for a few hours to have some alone time. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The wife lives in a studio, so space is limited. She works full-time, and her husband works part-time (10-20 hours a week). He's home most of the time and not very social, which means they're together a lot. She values alone time and sometimes asks him to leave. But when she does, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. He's also confused about why she needs specific hours and what he's supposed to do. They're planning a day trip, and he's upset if he can't stay home on Saturday, even though he's alone on Friday and might have Monday off.\n\nThe key points here are the need for personal space and the husband's feelings of not being welcome. The wife's request is understandable because in a studio, privacy is hard. She's working full-time and might need time to recharge. However, the husband's reaction is also valid. He might feel like his presence is a problem, especially since he's not working much and the apartment isn't his. His hurt feelings suggest that communication might be an issue.\n\nThe husband's job instability and financial situation add to the stress. They can't move to a bigger place, so the living situation is temporary. The wife's asking him to leave could be a way to cope, but the way it's handled might be causing more conflict. The husband's need for social interaction and feeling part of the home is important too. If he's not meeting friends, maybe he's feeling isolated, and her asking him to leave might exacerbate that.\n\nIs the wife in the wrong? Probably not. She's asserting her need for alone time, which is reasonable. However, the way she communicates it might be part of the problem. If she's not explaining her needs clearly or considering his feelings, that could be an issue. But given the situation, her request isn't unreasonable. The husband's reaction is more about his feelings of not being accepted in the home, which might need addressing through better communication. The answer would likely be B (No), but there are nuances where both have valid points.\n"
