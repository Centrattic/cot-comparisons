I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment, so space is limited. The husband works less and doesn't go out much, while the author works full-time and values alone time. The husband feels hurt and doesn't feel welcome when she asks him to leave.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They need alone time, which is important for their well-being. The husband is home a lot, so maybe having some time without each other makes sense. But the husband's reaction is emotional, feeling unwelcome. The author is trying to explain that he has plenty of free time otherwise. The issue seems to be communication and differing needs for personal space.\n\nThe husband's perspective: He's invested in the relationship and feels that being asked to leave makes him feel like an intruder. His job situation is unstable, so maybe he's more sensitive about his role in the household or feeling useful. He might be struggling with the idea that the home isn't his as well, even though he's living there.\n\nThe key points are about mutual understanding. The author is justified in wanting alone time, which is a common human need. However, how they communicate this might be causing the husband to feel rejected. The husband's reaction could stem from insecurity or feeling that his presence is a burden. The author might need to find a balance between their need for solitude and the husband's need to feel included and valued in their shared space.\n\nThe answer depends on whether the request is reasonable and if there's a lack of communication. The author isn't wrong for needing alone time, but perhaps the way they're enforcing it without considering the husband's feelings could be problematic. However, given the circumstances of their living situation and the husband's limited social life, it's a complex issue. The author isn't in the wrong because they have a valid need, but they might need to approach the situation more empathetically.\n"
