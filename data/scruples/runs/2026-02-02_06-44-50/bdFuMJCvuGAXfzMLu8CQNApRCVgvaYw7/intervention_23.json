I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They live in a studio apartment, which is small with no separate rooms. The author works full-time, while her husband works part-time, so he's home more often. The author values her alone time and wants a few hours alone on weekends. However, when she asks him to go out with friends or leave so she can have that time, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. He's also pointing out that she hasn't specified exactly how many hours he needs to be out and what to do if his friends aren't available. \n\nThe author is planning a day trip on Sunday and wants him to not be home on Saturday as well. He's upset because he feels it's taking away his relaxing weekend, but he's home alone on Friday and Monday. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but others might disagree.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author is asking for personal space, which is a valid need. In a studio apartment, having no alone time can be challenging. However, her husband feels that when she asks him to leave, it makes him feel unwelcome. He might be feeling that his presence is an inconvenience, which can affect his sense of belonging in the home. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author has a right to personal space, but her husband also has a right to feel included and part of the home. The way she's communicating her needs might be causing hurt feelings because she's not considering his emotional response. Instead of just asking him to leave, maybe discussing and finding a middle ground would help. For example, setting specific times, or engaging in activities that don't require him to leave, like using noise-canceling headphones or designating a shared but respectful space.\n\nAlso, considering their financial situation and that they're trying to move, it's a temporary situation. However, the current setup is causing conflict. The husband's job situation is unstable, so he might have fewer social outlets, making his free time more precious to him. The author might not be considering how her requests impact his mental well-being and social life.\n\nIn terms of fault, it's a two-way street. The author's needs are valid, but the way she's addressing them might be contributing to the husband's feelings. He might be overreacting by taking it personally, but his emotions are real. The author could be more empathetic and find ways to compromise. Since the husband feels hurt and unwelcome, that's a significant issue. The author isn't wrong for needing space, but the approach might be flawed. Therefore, she's not entirely in the wrong, but there's room for better communication and understanding from both sides. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that both could improve their approach.\n"
