I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple living in a studio apartment. The author wants some alone time and asks her husband to leave for a few hours, but he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author values her alone time, which is understandable. Studio apartments are small, so having someone else around all the time can be stressful. She works full time, and while her husband works part-time, he's home a lot. She's trying to create some personal space, which is a legitimate need.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband seems to feel that the apartment isn't his home yet. He's hurt when she asks him to leave, and he's struggling with the idea that he can't spend his free time as he pleases. He mentions his friends aren't available, so maybe he's not used to being alone. But the author points out that he's home a lot and has free time on other days. \n\nThe key issues here are communication and mutual understanding. The author's request isn't unreasonable, especially if she's trying to maintain her mental health. However, the way the request is made might affect how it's received. If she's being inflexible (specifying exact hours) and not considering his feelings, that could be part of the problem. But from her description, she's trying to explain her need without being harsh.\n\nAlso, the husband's reaction seems to stem from feeling unwelcome. Maybe he's not comfortable with the idea of being alone, even though he's home often. It's possible he needs to work on his own feelings of isolation or find other ways to spend time. The author isn't wrong for wanting alone time, but maybe both need to communicate better and find a middle ground, like setting specific times when they can have alone time without making it about exclusion.\n\nThe fact that they're planning to move when his situation improves suggests they've discussed it before. The immediate issue is the request for a few hours alone. Since she's justified the need based on her mental health and the husband's free time isn't being fully utilized, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. It's more about how they handle the situation moving forward rather than a clear right or wrong.\n"
