I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault for making their husband leave the apartment for a couple of hours. They live in a studio apartment, which doesn't have separate rooms, so they're always together except when the husband is working. The husband works part-time, so he's home a lot. The author values alone time and sometimes feels the need to have a few hours to themselves. When she asks him to go out, he gets hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome. They're considering moving to a bigger place but can't due to financial issues with his unstable job.\n\nHmm, the main issue here is the need for personal space versus the husband feeling unwelcome. The author explains that the husband is home most of the time, and they don't have kids. She wants some alone time, which is reasonable. But the husband is getting hurt and feeling like he's not part of the home. \n\nI think it's a common problem in couples, especially in small living spaces. The author isn't being unfair by wanting alone time. It's normal to need some personal space. The husband's reaction seems more complicated. He might be feeling neglected or insecure, but he also has the option to go out and socialize, which he isn't doing much. The author is trying to communicate her needs, which is good. The husband's response of needing specific hours and being upset might be an overreaction. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he's home alone on other days, like Friday and Monday, so the request for a couple of hours on Saturday isn't taking away all his time. The husband's argument about the weekend not being relaxing if he can't be home on Saturday doesn't seem valid if he's home on other days. \n\nFinancial constraints are a factor, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong for wanting alone time now. They can't move yet, so they have to manage their current situation. The key is communication and finding a middle ground. The author's approach might need to be more empathetic, but she's not in the wrong for expressing her needs. The husband might need to work on his feelings of insecurity or find other ways to spend time when his wife is away. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's justified in wanting alone time, and the husband's reaction is the problematic part here. The situation needs mutual understanding, but the question is whether she's at fault, and I don't think she is.\n"
