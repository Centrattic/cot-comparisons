I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple living in a studio apartment where the wife asks her husband to leave for a few hours on weekends. The husband takes it personally, feeling unwelcome, and the wife is frustrated because she needs alone time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife has a valid need for personal space, especially since they work different hours and there's no kids. She's working full-time, so maybe she's exhausted and needs some time to unwind. The husband, on the other hand, works part-time and doesn't have many social activities, so being at home all the time might be hard for him. But he seems to take her request as a rejection, which might stem from insecurity or feeling like he's not part of the home.\n\nThe wife's asking for time to herself isn't unreasonable. Everyone needs alone time, and the studio apartment setup makes it hard. The husband's reaction, however, seems a bit over the top. He's home a lot, and the wife isn't asking him to leave every day just a couple of hours on the weekend. Also, there's mention that he's not meeting friends often, so maybe he needs to find other outlets or hobbies.\n\nFinancial constraints and job instability are mentioned as barriers to moving to a bigger place. That's a real issue, so the wife can't just move. The husband's job situation is unstable, so it's not his fault he can't contribute more financially yet. But that doesn't mean the wife is in the wrong for needing space.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The wife's needs are valid, but the husband's feelings are being hurt. The problem might be that the husband is interpreting her request as him not being wanted, which could be a deeper issue. However, the wife isn't wrong for wanting alone time. It's about balancing both partners' needs. Since the husband is home a lot and doesn't have many social engagements, he might need to find ways to occupy himself, but the wife isn't obligated to provide those. She's not the one causing him to be home all the time. His responsibility is to find activities, not hers to accommodate his absence. \n\nSo, the wife isn't in the wrong. The husband's reaction is part of the issue, but the initial request for alone time is reasonable. Answer B.\n"
