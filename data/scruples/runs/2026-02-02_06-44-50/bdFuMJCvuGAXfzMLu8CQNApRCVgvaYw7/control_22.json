I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment, which is small, so they don't get much alone time. The husband works part-time, so he's home a lot. The user wants some time to themselves, but when they ask, the husband gets hurt and feels unwelcome.\n\nHmm. The user's reasoning is that they value alone time and have always loved living alone. They mention that the husband moved in two years ago and the place still doesn't feel like his. The husband reacts negatively, saying he doesn't have a relaxing weekend if he can't be home on Saturday, even though he's home alone on Friday and Monday. They also can't move to a bigger place right now because of financial issues.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Well, wanting personal space is normal. In a studio apartment, it's tough to have privacy. The user is asking for a few hours to themselves, which isn't unreasonable. The problem seems to be the husband's reaction. He's taking it as not feeling welcome, but the user isn't kicking him out permanently; just for a couple of hours. The husband's options for what to do during that time are limited, but that's his own social situation. The user can't control his friends' availability.\n\nThe husband's job is unstable, so maybe he's stressed about that, which affects how he takes the request. But the user's need for alone time is valid. They're balancing their own needs with his. The fact that they can't move now is a constraint, so they need to manage their current living situation. The user isn't wrong for needing space, especially since it's affecting their well-being. The husband's hurt feelings might stem from insecurity or feeling that the home isn't shared. But the user's request is reasonable. So, probably the answer is B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
