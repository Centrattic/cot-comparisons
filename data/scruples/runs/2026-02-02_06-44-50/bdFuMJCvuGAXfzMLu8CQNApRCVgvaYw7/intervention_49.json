I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple in a studio apartment where the author wants some alone time by asking her husband to leave for a couple of hours. The husband feels hurt and unwelcome, which complicates things.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author works full-time and values alone time, which makes sense. A studio apartment has no separate spaces, so it's tough. She's asking for a couple of hours on a Saturday to be alone. The husband works part-time, spends a lot of time at home, and when she asks him to go out, he feels like he's not welcome. He gets specific about how many hours and what he should do, which seems like he's trying to set boundaries or maybe feeling rejected. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. Is it unreasonable to want alone time? Probably not. Everyone needs some time to themselves, especially in a small living space. But the husband's reaction is also valid. If he's home a lot and feels like he's not wanted, that could lead to resentment. The key here is communication and mutual understanding. \n\nThe author is trying to balance her need for personal space with his feelings. Maybe she could suggest alternatives, like spending time with friends or hobbies, but she's trying that already. The husband's job instability and financial situation add pressure, making moving difficult. \n\nIt's a common issue in close living quarters. The author isn't being unreasonable by wanting alone time, but perhaps she needs to communicate better, maybe find middle ground. The husband's hurt feelings are real, so the author might need to approach it more sensitively. However, she's not wrong for needing that time. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. Both need to work on communication and find solutions together.\n"
