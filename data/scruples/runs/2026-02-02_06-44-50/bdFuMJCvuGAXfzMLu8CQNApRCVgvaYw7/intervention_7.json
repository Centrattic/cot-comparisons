I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author is a woman in a studio apartment with her husband. She's asking him to leave for a few hours to have some alone time. They live in a big city where affordable housing is hard to find. Her husband works part-time, so he's home a lot. She values her alone time and has always loved living alone. When she asks him to go out, he gets hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. The author is wondering if she's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid need for personal space. Studio apartments are small, and with both people working, even if his hours are part-time, it's possible that she needs some time to herself. It's not uncommon for people to value alone time, especially if they were used to living alone before moving in together.\n\nOn the other hand, her husband seems to be feeling that his presence is making her ask him to leave, which might be affecting his sense of belonging in their home. He's not working a full-time job, so maybe he's home even more. But he also doesn't have a lot of social connections, so when she asks him to go out, he might feel like he doesn't have options. His reaction seems a bit over the top, though. If she's asking for a few hours on a Saturday afternoon, and he's home all day on Friday and might have Monday off, maybe he could find something to do without relying on friends.\n\nThe author's explanation is that she wants to have some time alone, which is a reasonable request. The husband's response of feeling unwelcome might be more about his feelings of insecurity or perhaps not feeling integrated into the home. The fact that they can't move to a bigger apartment yet adds to the tension because they can't get more space easily.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's request is reasonable. She's not asking for the entire day, just a couple of hours. The husband's hurt feelings and needing exact hours might be an overreaction. It's important to communicate and find a middle ground, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting her space. The husband might need to work on his response, perhaps by finding other activities or understanding that her need for alone time isn't a reflection of him not being welcome. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. She's advocating for her needs, which is important in a relationship. The husband's reaction is more indicative of the issue here. So the answer is B.\n"
