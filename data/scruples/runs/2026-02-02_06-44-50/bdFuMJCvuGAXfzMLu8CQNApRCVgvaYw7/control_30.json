I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment, which means no privacy. The husband works part-time and doesn't go out much, so he's home a lot. The author wants some alone time but when they ask, the husband gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The user wants to know if the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid need for personal space, especially since they work full-time and have no kids. Studio apartments are tough for two people because privacy is limited. The husband, on the other hand, might feel that his presence is being resented or that he's not part of the household. His job situation is unstable, which might contribute to his need for home as a safe space.\n\nBut the author isn't asking for a lot\u2014just a couple of hours on a Saturday afternoon. The husband's reaction seems excessive. He's not being asked to leave every day, just occasionally. The fact that he's home alone on other days (like Friday and Monday) shows that he does have time alone, so his argument about not having a relaxing weekend doesn't hold up. The key here is communication. The author is trying to express their need for alone time, which is reasonable. The husband's feeling of not being welcome might come from insecurity or not feeling included in the shared living space. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for needing personal space. Everyone deserves that. The issue might be more about how the request is communicated. Maybe the husband feels like his needs are being ignored. But the author isn't at fault for wanting some time to themselves. They're trying to balance both their needs and his. So, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
