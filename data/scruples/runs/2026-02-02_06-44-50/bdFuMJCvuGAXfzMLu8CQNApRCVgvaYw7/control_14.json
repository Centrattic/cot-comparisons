I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The situation is a studio apartment, so space is limited. The husband works part-time and doesn't go out much, while the wife values alone time. She wants a couple hours of privacy, but when she asks, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. They can't move to a bigger place yet because of financial issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife's need for personal space is valid. Many people need time alone to recharge, especially in a small living arrangement. She's working full-time, so having time to herself is important for her well-being. On the other hand, the husband feels that being asked to leave makes him feel like he doesn't belong in their shared home. His job is unstable, he's not working many hours, and maybe he doesn't have a strong social network. So, when she asks him to leave, he interprets it as not being welcome.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The wife is asking for something reasonable, but the husband's reaction seems to stem from deeper feelings of insecurity or not feeling at home. Maybe he's using the request as a way to express other frustrations. The wife's approach could be improved by discussing the issue more openly and finding compromises, like setting specific times or exploring other activities for him to do when she needs space. However, the husband's overreaction might be the bigger issue here. It's not about who is in the wrong per se, but whether the wife's action is unfair. Since she's asking for a reasonable amount of time and the husband's response is more about feeling unwelcome, the wife isn't necessarily in the wrong. The problem might be more about how the request is communicated and how each partner perceives their needs. The husband's behavior of feeling hurt and needing exact hours seems a bit excessive. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
