I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for making their husband leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio, which is a small space with no separate rooms. The husband works part-time, so he's home a lot. The user wants some alone time, which they value, but when they ask him to go out, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. They mention that he's home alone on other days, but he still resents the request for a couple of hours on Saturday. The user is considering moving to a bigger place but can't due to financial issues.\n\nFirst, the user's need for alone time is valid. Many people need personal space, especially in a small living arrangement. The user isn't asking for a lot\u2014just a few hours. The husband's reaction seems excessive. He's home most of the time and even has days when he's alone. The fact that he gets hurt when asked to leave for a few hours suggests he might have feelings of insecurity or not feeling included. However, the user isn't demanding he go out every day; it's occasional. The husband's job situation is part of the problem, but that doesn't negate the user's need for space. The user isn't being selfish; they're trying to balance his time at home with their need for solitude. The answer should be B, the user isn't in the wrong. They're setting a reasonable boundary that's necessary for their well-being, and the husband's reaction is the issue here.\n"
