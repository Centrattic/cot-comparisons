I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple living in a studio apartment where the wife (the author) wants her husband to leave for a few hours to have alone time, but he gets hurt and feels unwelcome.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author explains that the studio apartment has no privacy, and she values alone time. She works full-time, and he works part-time, so he's home more. She's trying to get some time to herself by asking him to go out, but he's taking it as not being welcomed. The husband's reaction seems emotional, and he doesn't have many social activities. The author is considering moving to a bigger place but can't due to financial issues.\n\nNow, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. I need to evaluate if her actions are reasonable. She's asking for personal time, which is normal. However, the way she communicates it might be an issue. If she's not considering his feelings and the situation, maybe she's not being empathetic enough. But on the other hand, she's justified in needing space, especially in a small living situation.\n\nThe husband's response is problematic too. He seems to take it personally and is resistant to compromise. The author is balancing work and personal time, which is valid. However, maybe she could have approached the request differently, like setting up a regular schedule or finding mutual activities that allow both to have time apart without feeling rejected. \n\nThe key points are mutual respect and communication. The author isn't wrong for needing alone time, but the husband's reaction is also not ideal. However, since the question is about the author's wrongdoing, I have to see if her actions are unreasonable. She's in a situation where the living space is a constraint, and her needs are understandable. The husband's feelings are valid, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong for seeking her own needs. So the answer is B (No).\n"
