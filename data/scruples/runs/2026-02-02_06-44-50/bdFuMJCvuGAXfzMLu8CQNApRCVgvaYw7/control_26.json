I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author lives with her husband in a studio apartment and wants some alone time. She asks him to leave for a couple of hours, but he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. She's working full time, he works less and is home more. She values her alone time because living alone before, but he seems to take her request personally.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clearly stating that she needs personal space. Studio apartments are small, so having no alone time can be stressful. She's not saying he can't be in the apartment, just that she needs a few hours to herself. But when she asks, he gets emotional and feels like it's about him not belonging. He's home a lot, maybe not finding enough activities outside, so when she asks for time alone, he feels rejected or like he's being excluded.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author is asking for a reasonable request\u2014time to herself. But her husband is interpreting it as him being unwelcome. Maybe there's a communication breakdown. The author's reasoning is that he has plenty of free time, so leaving for a few hours shouldn't be a problem. But he might feel that his needs aren't being considered too\u2014maybe he doesn't have a strong social circle, so when she asks him to be away, he can't easily fill that time.\n\nAlso, the husband's reaction seems to be more about feeling unvalued or not being part of the home. The author mentions that he hasn't adjusted to the apartment being his home yet. That could be part of the issue. Maybe there's underlying resentment or insecurity in the relationship that's coming out here. The author isn't wrong for needing alone time, but perhaps she could approach the request differently, maybe by being more considerate of his feelings or discussing solutions together, like finding activities for him when she needs space.\n\nOn the flip side, the husband's reaction might be overblown. He's home a lot and has time, so leaving for a few hours shouldn't be a big deal. But if he's not used to being on his own and doesn't have friends to meet, it's harder. The author might need to validate his feelings and find a middle ground. Maybe compromise on the time or help him find things to do when she needs space.\n\nLooking at the options, the question is if the author is in the wrong. From what's described, she's not being unreasonable. She's explaining her need for space, which is a common issue in close living situations. The problem seems more on her husband's side for taking it personally. However, the way she's asking might not be the best approach. If she's not considering his feelings and just demanding, that could be an issue. But the text doesn't show her being inconsiderate; she's trying to explain her reasons.\n\nSo, the answer would lean towards No, the author isn't in the wrong. She's justified in needing personal time, and the issue is more about his reaction and their communication. The husband's feelings are valid too, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong for wanting space.\n"
