I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for making their husband leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment, so space is tight. They both work, but he works fewer hours and is home a lot. She wants some alone time because she missed living alone. He gets hurt and feels unwelcome when she asks him to leave. They haven't moved to a bigger place yet because of financial issues.\n\nHmm. So, she's asking for a few hours to herself, which seems reasonable. Everyone needs some personal space, right? But he's taking it as a rejection, maybe? Maybe he's not used to the idea of not being together all the time. The problem might be communication. She wants alone time, he needs to feel included in their home. But she's not forcing him to leave all the time, just occasionally. He has free time on other days, like Friday and Monday. The fact that he's not meeting friends often could be a factor too. Maybe he's not using his free time well, but that's not her responsibility. \n\nOn the other hand, he's clearly hurt, and she might not be considering his feelings enough. Maybe instead of asking him to leave, she could find a compromise, like having separate times when they can be alone without making each other feel unimportant. But the core issue is her right to some personal space versus his need to feel at home. Since they can't move right now, maybe she's in the right to ask for some alone time because it's a studio apartment and they both need to adjust. But then again, she might not be communicating her needs in a way that doesn't make him feel excluded. \n\nI think the key points are that she's not asking for much time, just a couple hours, and he has other days alone. She's not being unreasonable. He needs to find his own activities, but that's his responsibility. So maybe she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
