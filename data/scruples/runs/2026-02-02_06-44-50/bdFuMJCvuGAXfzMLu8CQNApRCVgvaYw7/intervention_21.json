I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. \n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. They live in a studio apartment, which is a small space. The author works full-time, and her husband works only 10-20 hours a week. He's home a lot and doesn't go out much or meet friends frequently. The author values alone time and has always liked living alone. She wants a few hours to herself on a Saturday afternoon. When she asks him to leave, he feels hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome. She's also mentioned that they can't move to a bigger place right now because of financial issues related to his job.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that she needs personal space, especially given the tiny apartment. The husband's reaction is emotional, feeling unwelcome. The user (the person writing the post) is asking if she's at fault here.\n\nI need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, having no alone time in a small space can be stressful. She's explaining that she's used to living alone and needs that time for herself. On the other hand, the husband feels that being asked to leave is a rejection of his presence in the home. His job situation is unstable, and maybe his sense of belonging in the apartment is fragile. \n\nIs the author being unreasonable? Maybe not. Everyone needs some personal space. But the way she's handling it might not be the best. Instead of asking him to leave, perhaps they could find ways to create separation within the apartment, like using headphones or having a specific time when she's on her own without him necessarily leaving. However, the husband's reaction is also a problem. Feeling hurt and interpreting it as not being welcome is a red flag. Communication seems to be an issue here. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong because she's expressing a need, but she might need to approach it differently. The husband's reaction is also part of the problem. However, the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong. Since she's asking him to leave for her own needs, which is a legitimate request given the living situation, but the husband's emotional response complicates things. \n\nBut the husband is home all the time and has limited social activities. Maybe the author is expecting him to have a social life that he's not engaging in. However, the author's need for alone time is valid. It's a balance. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is not wrong for needing personal space, especially given the studio apartment. The husband might be overreacting by feeling like he's not welcome, but part of living with someone is respecting each other's needs. So the author isn't in the wrong. The key issue is the communication and finding a middle ground. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
