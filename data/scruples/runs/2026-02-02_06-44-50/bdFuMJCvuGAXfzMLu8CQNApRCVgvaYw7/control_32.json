I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong.\n\nThe author wants their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours to have alone time. They live in a studio apartment, so there's no space for privacy. The husband works part-time and isn't out much, so he's home a lot. When the author asks him to go out, he gets hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome. The author also mentions that the husband's job is unstable, making it hard to move to a bigger place.\n\nHmm, so the author is asking for personal space, which is a reasonable need. The husband's reaction seems to be about feeling unwelcome. But the author isn't kicking him out all the time, just occasionally. The problem is the husband's emotional response and not finding a compromise. The author isn't in the wrong because they have a valid need for alone time, especially in a small space. The husband should work on his feelings of not being welcome and maybe find other ways to spend time without the author. The financial situation complicates moving, so the author isn't at fault here. Answer B.\n"
