I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking their husband to leave for a couple of hours in their studio apartment to have some alone time. The husband is upset and feels uninvited in his own home, especially when asked to find something to do. The key points here are the living situation, the husband's job, and the communication issues.\n\nFirst, the apartment is a studio, which is a small space. Both partners being home all the time can lead to needing personal space. The author mentions working full-time and valuing alone time, which is understandable. The husband works less hours and doesn't have many social activities, so he's home more. When the author asks for time alone, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The author wants to go on a day trip, and the husband is upset if he can't be home on Saturday, even though he's home alone on other days. They can't move to a bigger place yet because of financial issues.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author's request for alone time seems reasonable. Everyone needs personal space, especially in a small living environment. However, the way the request is made might be an issue. If the author is making the husband feel like he's not part of the home by asking him to leave, that could be problematic. The husband's reaction is emotional, interpreting the request as not feeling welcome. The author might not be considering his feelings enough. \n\nThe husband's job situation and lack of social activities might contribute to his need for companionship. If he's not going out much, being asked to leave more often could make him feel isolated. The author's request might be valid, but the communication around it could be causing hurt. The husband's response about specifying exact hours and activities might be a way to feel more in control or to express his hurt. \n\nThe author's justification is that the husband has plenty of free time, but the husband feels that the specific requests for him to leave are affecting his weekend. There's a mismatch in how each perceives the situation. The author wants alone time, the husband feels rejected. The author's actions might not be the fault, but the lack of understanding of the husband's feelings could make them the asshole. \n\nHowever, the author is not wrong for needing personal space, which is a common human need. The problem might be in how the requests are communicated and the husband's reaction. The husband's sensitivity might be an issue here. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there's room for both to work on communication. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given that the husband's reaction is more about feeling unappreciated, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
