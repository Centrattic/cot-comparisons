I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the author is a woman who lives in a studio apartment with her husband. They don't have kids, and she works full-time, while he works 10-20 hours a week. She wants some alone time because the studio doesn't offer much privacy. She asks him to leave for a few hours on weekends, but he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. He also questions why she needs specific hours and what he should do when his friends aren't available. The author feels like he's not using his free time (like Friday and Monday) and doesn't understand his problem. They can't move to a bigger place because of financial issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's need for personal space is valid. Studio apartments are small, and having no alone time can be stressful. She's working full-time, so her need for downtime is understandable. On the other hand, the husband feels hurt when asked to leave, which suggests he might be feeling neglected or that his presence is a burden. His job is unstable, and maybe he's feeling insecure about his role in the relationship or his contributions. He also mentions that when she asks him to leave, he feels like the home isn't his, which is a big emotional issue.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author is trying to set boundaries for her mental health, which is important. However, the way she's communicating this might be causing hurt feelings. Maybe she hasn't explained her needs clearly enough, or he's not open to discussing compromise. The husband's reaction seems to stem from deeper insecurities, possibly related to his job situation and feeling like he's not contributing enough. The fact that he's home a lot and not meeting friends might also be a point of stress for him.\n\nFinancial constraints are a factor in not moving, so they can't solve the space issue right now. They need to find a middle ground. The author isn't wrong for wanting alone time, but maybe she needs to approach the conversation differently, ensuring he feels valued and included while respecting her needs. It's a balance. The husband's hurt feelings are a red flag that their communication might not be effective.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. She's advocating for her needs in a healthy relationship. However, there's room for better communication strategies. Since the question is whether she's in the wrong, the answer would be B (No), because her request is reasonable, and the problem lies more in how they're communicating and addressing each other's feelings.\n"
