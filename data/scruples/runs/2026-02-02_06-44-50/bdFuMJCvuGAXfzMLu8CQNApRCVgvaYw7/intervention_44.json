I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a couple of hours. The scenario is a studio apartment where they both live, and the husband works part-time, so he's home a lot. The wife wants some alone time, but when she asks, he feels hurt and doesn't understand.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife's need for personal space is valid. Studio apartments are small, so having no alone time can be stressful. She's working full-time, so maybe she needs that time to relax. On the other hand, the husband feels unwelcome when she asks him to leave. He might feel that his presence isn't appreciated, especially since he's the one with less work hours. He's home a lot and might not have many social outlets.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The wife is trying to express her need for alone time, which is reasonable. However, the husband's reaction suggests that he might not fully grasp her need, or maybe he feels rejected. It's possible that the way she's asking for him to leave could be coming off as dismissive. Maybe she could find a better way to communicate her needs without making him feel like he's not welcome in their home.\n\nAlso, the husband's situation is important. He works part-time, so he's home more, and if he's not meeting friends much, he might not have other activities. The wife might need to consider alternative solutions, like finding activities they can do separately within the apartment, or perhaps setting up specific times where they can have alone time without asking him to leave. But his reaction about needing to have him out for a specific number of hours and what he should do is a bit unreasonable. He should take initiative to find his own things to do or socialize more, rather than expecting her to arrange his time.\n\nThe wife isn't in the wrong because everyone has a right to personal space. However, the way she communicates her needs might need adjustment to be more considerate. The husband also needs to take responsibility by finding his own ways to spend time, instead of feeling hurt and expecting her to manage his schedule.\n\nIn terms of housing, they can't move yet due to financial constraints, so they have to work with the current setup. The root issue is their communication and how they handle each other's needs. The wife's request isn't unreasonable, but the husband's response is a problem. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
