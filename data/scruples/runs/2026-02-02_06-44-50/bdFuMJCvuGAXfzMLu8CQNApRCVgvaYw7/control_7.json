I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The situation involves a studio apartment, which is a small living space, and the husband works part-time while the author works full-time. The main issue is the author wanting some alone time, but the husband is hurt and feels unwelcome.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has a right to personal space, especially in a studio where there's no separate room. They mention working full-time and valuing alone time, which is valid. However, the husband feels that when asked to leave, it's not just about the time but also about feeling excluded. He might be struggling with the dynamics of the relationship, especially since he's home more often. His job is unstable, which could contribute to his feelings of insecurity or needing validation through social activities.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author's request is reasonable, but the husband's reaction indicates deeper issues. The husband's response about not being able to relax on weekends if he can't be home on Saturday might suggest that he's feeling his needs aren't being considered. The fact that he's home alone on other days doesn't negate his need for companionship or his feelings when his partner is not present.\n\nHowever, the author isn't wrong in wanting alone time. Everyone needs personal space, and it's important for a healthy relationship. The problem lies in how the request is communicated and the husband's reaction. The author might need to approach the conversation with more empathy, explaining their needs without making the husband feel rejected. On the other hand, the husband should also communicate his feelings without taking the request personally and find ways to occupy himself without relying solely on the author's time.\n\nThe fact that they haven't moved to a bigger apartment yet due to financial issues adds another layer. They might be in a transitional phase where both are adjusting to shared living. The husband's job instability could be a source of stress, affecting his sensitivity to being asked to leave.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting alone time, but the situation highlights a communication gap. Both parties need to work on understanding each other's needs better. The husband's hurt feelings are valid, but the author's right to personal space is also important. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong, but there's room for both to improve communication.\n"
