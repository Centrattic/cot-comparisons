I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple living in a studio apartment. The author wants some alone time and asks her husband to leave for a couple of hours, but he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. She's considering whether she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author values alone time, which is important for mental health. Living in a studio with no separate spaces makes it hard. She works full-time, he works part-time, and he doesn't socialize much. She's asking for a few hours alone on a Saturday, but he reacts negatively, feeling it's his home too. He points out that he's home alone on other days, like Friday and Monday. They can't move because of financial issues.\n\nNow, considering her request: asking someone to leave the home they live in could be seen as unreasonable if there's no other space. But she's explaining that she needs personal time because of the lack of privacy. He's not working much, so maybe he does have time to be home. But his reaction seems hurtful and maybe he's not validating her need for space. However, she's not asking him to leave every day, just a couple of hours on a Saturday.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's asserting her need for personal space, which is valid. But maybe the way she's doing it makes him feel excluded. But he's not offering alternatives, like doing something else in the apartment. Maybe she could have suggested activities they both can do or set boundaries without him leaving. But given the studio setup, sometimes alone time isn't possible unless one leaves. \n\nThe husband's response seems to be more about feeling ownership over the home, even though he's been there for two years. His job is unstable, so maybe he's anxious. But his reaction is hurtful. The author isn't being unreasonable in needing some time away. So maybe the husband is the one not being accommodating here. \n\nSo the answer is B (not in the wrong). She's justified in seeking alone time in a situation where physical space is limited. The husband's reaction is the issue, not her request.\n"
