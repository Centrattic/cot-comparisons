I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the letter is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours.\n\nFirst, the situation is they live in a studio apartment with no alone time. The husband works part-time, so he's home a lot. The woman wants some time to herself, which she's used to as she liked living alone. She's asked him to go out so she can have a few hours alone, but he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. She's trying to find a bigger place but can't due to his unstable job and high city costs.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal space and communication. She's not asking for a lot\u2014just a couple hours. He's home all the time, which might be causing tension. But when she asks, he takes it personally. Maybe he feels like he's not part of the home, hence his hurt feelings. She's trying to balance her need for alone time with his feelings.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, wanting alone time is normal, especially in a small space. She's being clear about her needs, but maybe not considering his feelings enough? Or maybe he's being overly sensitive. Since they both have valid needs, but the husband's reaction is about feeling unwelcome, maybe she could find a middle ground. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she's not doing anything malicious\u2014just asking for some space\u2014it's more of a communication issue rather than her being wrong. The husband's reaction might be the main problem here. So, probably not her fault. Answer B.\n"
