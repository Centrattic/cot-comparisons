I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment, which is really small. She works full-time, he works part-time, and they don't have kids. She needs some alone time because when they're both home, there's no privacy. She's tried suggesting he go out to meet friends or do something, but he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. He argues that he should specify how many hours she wants him out and what he can do. The husband seems to be struggling with the idea that his home isn't welcoming, even though she's the one who owns the apartment. They also can't move to a bigger place right now because of financial issues.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's wrong for asking him to leave. The key points here are about personal space needs versus the husband's feelings. She's not denying him a home; he's living there. But he feels that when she asks for time alone, it's like he's not welcome. However, she's the one who's used to living alone and values her alone time. The husband's job is part-time, so he's home more, which might make him feel more dependent on the apartment as his space. But he's supposed to be in a relationship where both need space. It's a balance. The fact that he's getting hurt suggests he might have a need for validation as a partner. But she's not doing anything extreme; just a few hours alone. Financial constraints prevent moving, so they have to find a solution now. The husband's reaction might be overreacting. But maybe she could communicate better, but the request seems reasonable. So probably the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
