I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment, so space is limited. The author wants some alone time, which I can understand. They mention that their husband works part-time and doesn't go out much, so he's home a lot. When the author asks him to leave for a few hours, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about needing personal space versus feeling excluded. The author is trying to get alone time, which is reasonable. The husband, on the other hand, feels like he's not part of the home. The husband's reaction might be emotional because he's not used to living together or feels his presence is a burden. The author also mentions that the husband has plenty of time alone during the week, so maybe the issue is about quality time or feeling needed.\n\nThe husband's response about not having a relaxing weekend unless he's home on Saturday seems a bit exaggerated. The author is asking for a couple of hours, but the husband is making it about the entire weekend. The problem might be communication. The author is clear about needing time, but the husband is taking it as rejection.\n\nAlso, the financial situation is a factor. They can't move to a bigger place right now, so they have to work with the space they have. It's a common issue in small living spaces. The author isn't unreasonable for wanting alone time, but maybe the husband's reaction is more about his feelings of not belonging. The author might need to find a compromise, like specific times when they can have space, but that doesn't mean the author is in the wrong. They have a valid need, and the husband's reaction is more about his own feelings. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
