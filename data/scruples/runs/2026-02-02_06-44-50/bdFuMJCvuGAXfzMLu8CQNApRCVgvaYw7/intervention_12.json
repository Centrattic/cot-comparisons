I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. Let me break this down.\n\nThe main issue here is the studio apartment setup with no privacy. The author values alone time and sometimes wants to be alone. They work full-time, while their husband works part-time and stays home more. The husband seems to feel that being asked to leave is a rejection, interpreting it as not being welcome in his own home. The author is trying to get some personal time, which is understandable given the living situation. But the husband is reacting emotionally, feeling hurt and questioning the exact hours and activities he should do when he's out.\n\nSo, the key points are the need for personal space versus the husband's feelings about being asked to leave. The author's request is reasonable; everyone needs some alone time. However, the way the husband is reacting might be more about his insecurity or feelings of not being included. The problem might not just be the request itself but how they communicate and perceive each other's needs.\n\nThe husband's job situation is unstable, and they can't move yet. The author isn't asking for a huge amount of time, just a couple of hours on a Saturday afternoon. It's not that they never see each other; he's home alone on other days too. The husband's problem with the request isn't about the time but perhaps deeper feelings of not feeling valued or part of the home.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is asking for a basic need\u2014personal space\u2014which is valid. The husband's reaction might be a communication issue or emotional response. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a legitimate need that's not being met, and the husband's response might be more about his own feelings rather than the request itself. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
