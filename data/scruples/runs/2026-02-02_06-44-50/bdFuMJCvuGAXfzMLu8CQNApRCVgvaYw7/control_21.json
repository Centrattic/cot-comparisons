I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment, which is small, and she feels like she needs alone time. She works full-time, while he works less and stays home more. He's getting hurt feelings when she asks him to leave, saying he doesn't feel welcome.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is asking for personal space, which is a valid need. Many people value alone time, especially in a small living space. She's not asking for anything unreasonable, just a couple of hours. But the husband's reaction is important too. He feels it's his home and is upset when she asks him to leave, which might indicate he's not comfortable with the idea of her needing time alone. \n\nThe husband's job situation is unstable, and they can't move right now. So he's home more often, which might contribute to his feelings of not having a home. But she's not asking for days on end, just a few hours. It seems like a reasonable request for her mental health and personal time. \n\nThe key points are: the request is specific and temporary, not a constant thing. She's not avoiding him but needs alone time. The husband's reaction is about feeling unwelcome, which might be a deeper issue about boundaries or insecurity. The fact that he's home a lot and not going out much might make him more sensitive to being asked to leave.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. Everyone needs personal space, and in a studio apartment, it's hard. The husband's response seems more about feeling unappreciated or insecure rather than the request itself. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
