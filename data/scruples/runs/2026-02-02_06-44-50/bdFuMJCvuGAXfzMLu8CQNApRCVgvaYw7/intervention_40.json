I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a couple of hours. The situation is that they live in a studio apartment with no private space, and the author wants some alone time. The husband, who works less, is home most of the time and gets hurt when asked to leave. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid need for alone time, especially since they work full-time and the husband's presence makes it hard to have that. The husband, on the other hand, feels unwelcome when asked to leave. He's home a lot and might feel isolated if he doesn't have friends to meet. The fact that he's not working much could contribute to his feelings of not having a relaxing weekend. \n\nThe key points here are the need for personal space and the husband's emotional response. The author's request isn't unreasonable given the living situation. However, the way the husband reacts might stem from feeling insecure or lonely. The author might not be in the wrong because they're just asking for time to themselves, which is important for mental health. But maybe the author could approach it more sensitively, like finding compromises or discussing it without making the husband feel like he's being asked to leave the home. \n\nThe husband's job instability and financial issues also play a role. They can't move to a bigger place right now, so they have to work with what they have. The author's request for a few hours alone shouldn't be seen as rejecting the husband's presence in the home. It's more about needing time to recharge. The husband's hurt feelings might not be justified if the author is only asking for a couple of hours and not making it a regular thing. However, if the husband feels that his home is being taken away, that could be a valid concern too. \n\nI think the balance here is between the author's need for personal space and the husband's feelings of not being accepted. The author isn't in the wrong because everyone needs some alone time, especially in a small living space. The husband, however, needs to address his own feelings of isolation and maybe find other ways to spend time when the author is busy. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
