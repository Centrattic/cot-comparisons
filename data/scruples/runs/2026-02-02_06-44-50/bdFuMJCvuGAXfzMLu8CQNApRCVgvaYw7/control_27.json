I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple living in a studio apartment, and the wife wants her husband to leave for a few hours to have some alone time. The husband feels hurt and doesn't want to go out, saying he doesn't feel welcome. The question is whether the author (the wife) is wrong for asking this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife has a valid reason: they live in a small space with no alone time. She works full-time, and he works part-time. She values her privacy and needs some time to herself. It's reasonable for someone to need personal space, especially in a studio where there's no separation between living areas. She's not asking for a lot\u2014just a couple of hours on a Saturday afternoon. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband feels that the apartment isn't his home yet. He might feel like he's being asked to leave, which could make him feel unwelcome. He's also working less, so maybe he's already home a lot, and the request might feel like it's adding more pressure on him to find things to do when his friends aren't available. His reaction seems emotional, indicating he might be feeling insecure about his place in the relationship or the home.\n\nBut the key point here is whether the wife is in the wrong. The problem seems more about communication and differing needs. The wife is expressing her need for alone time, which is normal. The husband's reaction is about feeling unwelcome, but he's already home a lot. The wife isn't excluding him from the home entirely, just asking for some time. Also, the husband's job situation is unstable, making moving to a bigger place difficult, so the wife can't just solve the problem by moving. \n\nI think the wife isn't wrong for needing personal space. It's a common issue in close living situations. The main issue is how the husband is reacting, possibly due to unmet emotional needs or insecurity. The wife isn't asking for something unreasonable. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
