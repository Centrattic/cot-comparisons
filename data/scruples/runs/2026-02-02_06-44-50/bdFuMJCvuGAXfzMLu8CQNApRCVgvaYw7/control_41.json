I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author lives in a studio apartment with her husband. She wants some alone time, so she asks him to leave for a couple of hours. He gets hurt and feels unwelcome in his own home. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author values her alone time, which is understandable. Living in a studio apartment means there's no separate space, so when both are home, they're always together. She works full-time, and he works fewer hours. She's not saying he should leave every time, just sometimes, like a few hours on a Saturday. She mentioned he has plenty of free time, like on Fridays and Mondays, so maybe she's asking for something reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband feels hurt. He moved into her apartment two years ago and might not feel it's his home yet. When she asks him to leave, he interprets it as not being welcome. He wants to know exact hours and what he should do, which might indicate he feels anxious or unappreciated. His job is unstable, which could contribute to his emotional state. He might be sensitive about his role in the relationship or feeling like he's not contributing enough financially, leading to insecurity.\n\nIs asking for alone time unreasonable? Well, needing personal space is a common human need. The problem arises in how the request is made and the husband's reaction. If she's consistently asking in a way that makes him feel excluded or unloved, maybe there's a communication issue. However, the fact that he has days when he's home alone (like Fridays and Mondays) suggests he does have time to himself, so her request for a couple of hours on Saturday might not be excessive.\n\nThe husband's reaction seems a bit over the top. Feeling that he can't have a relaxing weekend unless he's home Saturday, even though he has other days free, might indicate he's not coping well with the request. His comment about needing to meet friends to have something to do implies he might not have a strong social network, which could be a separate issue.\n\nThe author isn't being cruel; she's seeking a basic need for personal time. The husband's feelings are important too, but his response seems to be taking it personally. It might be that the way she's communicating the request could be more empathetic, but the core need for alone time isn't inherently wrong. The situation could benefit from better communication and understanding both perspectives.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might need to adjust. The author could consider how her requests affect him and maybe find compromise, like suggesting activities he can do alone or together that allow her some space. The husband could work on his independence and maybe explore more activities he can do alone or with friends, reducing his reliance on being home. However, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting alone time. Her needs are valid, and the problem is more about the husband's reaction and their communication style rather than her having a legitimate request.\n"
