I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a person (the author) asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours because they live in a studio apartment and need alone time. The husband feels hurt and unwelcome, and there's some tension around their living situation and job stability.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author values alone time and wants to have some hours without their husband. They mention that the husband is home a lot, with an unstable job, and they can't move due to financial reasons. The husband's reaction is feeling hurt and not welcomed, and he's struggling to find time with friends. \n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nI should consider both sides. The author's need for personal space is valid, especially in a studio apartment where privacy is limited. It's common for people to want some time alone for relaxation or personal activities. However, the way the author is asking might be affecting the husband's feelings. The husband's feelings of not feeling welcome could stem from his own needs not being met. He might feel that the author is prioritizing her space over his comfort, especially since he's home a lot and maybe feels isolated. \n\nThe husband's job situation adds another layer. His job is unstable, and he might be using the time at home to deal with that insecurity. If he's not working much, being home might be his only routine. When the author asks him to leave, it could be perceived as rejecting his presence, making him feel like he's not part of the home. \n\nCommunication seems to be a key issue here. The author might not be explaining the need for alone time in a way that the husband understands. The husband's reaction of wanting specific hours and activities could indicate a need for validation or reassurance that his presence isn't a burden. \n\nAlso, the fact that they haven't moved out due to financial constraints might contribute to the husband's feeling that this is his home, and any time away is a loss. The author might not be recognizing the husband's emotional needs in the equation. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author's need for personal space is legitimate. Living in a studio without privacy can lead to stress. The husband's response being hurt and feeling unwelcome might not be the author's intention, but his reaction is valid from his perspective. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a balance. The author has a right to want alone time, but the way they communicate it might be causing the husband to feel unwelcome. The husband's feelings are also valid, but he might need to find ways to engage with friends or manage his time better. The author could work on expressing her needs more empathetically, while the husband might need to address his own feelings of insecurity. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is asking for a reasonable amount of time alone, which is a personal need, it's not inherently wrong. However, the approach might need adjustment. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to be careful here. The husband's perspective is important too, but the author's needs are valid as well. It's a mutual adjustment situation. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting alone time, but there's room for better communication. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
