I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment, which has no privacy. The husband works part-time and doesn't go out much, so he's home a lot. The author wants some alone time, which they can't get when he's around. They've tried asking him to meet friends or do something on Saturday afternoons, but he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The husband also mentions having free time on other days but still feels it's not enough.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is seeking personal space, which is a reasonable need. The husband's reaction of feeling hurt and not welcome might be his emotional response, but the author's request is about their own well-being. The key points are the lack of privacy in a studio apartment, the author's need for alone time, and the husband's feelings of not being welcomed.\n\nThe husband's job situation is unstable, so moving isn't an option right now. The author isn't asking for a lot\u2014just a couple of hours. The husband's response seems a bit over the top, maybe because he's not used to being in a shared living situation or feels neglected. However, the author's request isn't unreasonable given the circumstances. The problem seems to be in communication and mutual understanding. The author is not being selfish; they have a legitimate need. The husband might need to work on his emotional response and find alternative ways to spend time when asked. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
