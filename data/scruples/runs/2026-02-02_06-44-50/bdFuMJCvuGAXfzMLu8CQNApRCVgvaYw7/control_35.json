I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The scenario involves them living in a studio apartment, so space is limited. The woman works full-time, and her husband works part-time (10-20 hours a week). She wants some alone time, which he seems to not fully understand or support. When she asks him to leave, he gets hurt and questions the exact hours and what he's supposed to do. He's also bringing up the weekend plans and his free time on other days.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The woman's need for alone time is valid. People often need personal space to recharge, especially in a small living arrangement. She mentions that she values solitude and has always loved living alone. The studio apartment setup makes it hard when both are home all the time. So her request isn't unreasonable\u2014it's about mental health and personal space.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband feels hurt and doesn't see why he can't be home. He might feel that his presence is a burden, or that he's being excluded from his own home. His job situation is unstable, and he's not out of the house as much as she is. His reaction might stem from insecurity or feeling that his home isn't accepted by his spouse. He's trying to figure out what he's supposed to do if his friends can't meet him, which could indicate he's not used to being alone or doesn't have a lot of social activities.\n\nLooking at the dynamics, the woman is clear about her needs, but the husband is struggling to adjust. The key here is communication. The woman isn't asking for a huge amount of time\u2014just a couple of hours. But the husband's reaction is emotional, which might suggest deeper issues. However, the woman isn't wrong for needing space. It's important to recognize that in a shared living situation, both partners should have their needs met. The husband's feelings are valid too, but he might need to find ways to manage alone time or build a social circle. The fact that they can't move to a bigger apartment right now due to financial reasons doesn't mean the woman's request is wrong. She's not asking for something unreasonable; it's about personal well-being.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She has the right to ask for some alone time, especially in a small space. The husband's hurt feelings are his to manage, but that doesn't make her request wrong. They need to work on communication and finding solutions that accommodate both their needs, but the initial request isn't something she's at fault for.\n"
