I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The situation is that they live in a studio apartment, which doesn't have much alone time. The author works full-time, and her husband works 10-20 hours a week, so he's home a lot. She values alone time and sometimes asks him to leave so she can have some space. But when she does, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. She feels like she's justified because she needs personal time, but he's taking it as him not being wanted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, living in a studio with no privacy can be really stressful. She's working full-time, so maybe she's tired and needs some me-time. It's normal to want personal space, especially if you're used to living alone. However, she's married now, so there's a shared living situation. Her husband works part-time, so maybe he's already feeling like he's not as busy or involved, and when she asks him to leave, it might hurt his feelings because he might feel unappreciated or not valued as a partner.\n\nThe husband's reaction is important here. He says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home when she asks him to leave. That's a strong reaction. It could be that he's feeling insecure or that he's not getting enough attention or time with her. Also, he mentions that when she asks him to meet friends, he's not always able to, which adds to the hurt. Maybe he's feeling like she's prioritizing her alone time over his social needs, even though she's just trying to get some space.\n\nAnother factor is their housing situation. They can't move to a bigger place right now because of financial instability. So the studio is their reality for now. That means they have to find ways to manage their shared space. The author is trying to set boundaries for her own well-being, which is important. But setting boundaries shouldn't come at the expense of making the other person feel unwelcome. Maybe there's a middle ground here, like specific times when they can have alone time without making it feel like a demand.\n\nAlso, communication is key here. The author is expressing her needs, but maybe not in a way that's validating her husband's feelings. If she explains that she needs time to recharge and that it's not about him, he might feel better. Conversely, if she's not acknowledging his feelings, he might feel like he's not being heard.\n\nThe husband's point about having free time on other days (like Friday and Monday) is something the author brings up. She doesn't see why Saturday is his only chance for a relaxing weekend. Maybe he feels like those other days aren't as relaxing for him, or perhaps he doesn't have the same ability to relax when she's around. Maybe he's not getting enough quality time with her, so when she takes time for herself, he feels like he's losing even that.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't wrong to want alone time, but the way she's approaching it might be causing unnecessary hurt. It's possible that the husband's reaction is more about underlying issues, like feeling neglected or not secure in the relationship. It's a balance between personal needs and the relationship's health. The author might need to find a way to communicate her needs without making him feel excluded, and he might need to find other ways to spend his time or express his feelings.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, she's not wrong for wanting alone time, which is a normal and healthy need. But if her actions are causing her husband to feel unwelcome or unloved, then maybe she could approach it differently. The key here is that both partners have valid needs, and the issue is about how to meet them without hurting each other. Since the author's request is reasonable (a couple of hours on a Saturday afternoon) and the husband is reacting emotionally, it might not be entirely her fault. However, she could be more considerate in her communication. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she's expressing a need that's reasonable and the husband's reaction is more about his feelings, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong, but there's room for better communication. So maybe the answer is B for No.\n"
