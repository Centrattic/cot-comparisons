I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a couple of hours. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they live in a studio apartment, so space is limited. The author works full-time, while her husband works 10-20 hours a week, meaning he's home more often. She wants some alone time, which she's used to when living alone. She's not asking for a lot\u2014just a few hours on a Saturday. But when she asks, he gets hurt and questions why she needs specific hours or what he should do. He feels like she's not including him or making him busy.\n\nThe husband also mentions that if he can't go out on Saturday, his weekend is ruined. But he's home alone on Friday and might be home on Monday too. The author is confused why this is a problem when he has so much free time. They can't move to a bigger place yet because of financial issues related to his job.\n\nSo, the key points here are the need for personal space vs. the husband's feelings of exclusion. The author is asking for time to herself, which is reasonable. The husband's reaction seems to be about feeling unwelcome or not being prioritized. But the author isn't asking for a lot\u2014just a few hours. The husband's job situation is unstable, which adds to the financial constraints, so moving isn't an option right now.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't doing something unethical. People need personal time, especially in a small living space. The husband's reaction might stem from insecurity or needing more inclusion. The author isn't the one in the wrong here. The problem is more about communication and differing needs. So the answer should be B.\n"
