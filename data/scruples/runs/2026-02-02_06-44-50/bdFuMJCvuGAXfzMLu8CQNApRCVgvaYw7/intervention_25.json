I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. They live in a studio apartment with no kids, so space is tight. The husband works part-time (10-20 hours a week), so he's home a lot. The author values alone time and sometimes asks him to leave so she can have a few hours to herself. However, the husband feels hurt and doesn't understand why she needs this time, especially since he's home alone quite a bit already.\n\nThe author mentions that when she suggests he go out to meet friends or do something, he gets hurt and wants specific details about how long she needs and what he should do. She also points out that he's already home alone on days like Friday and possibly Monday, so she's confused by his complaint about not having a relaxing weekend if he's not with her on Saturday. They can't afford a bigger apartment because of financial instability.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about boundaries and mutual understanding. The author is seeking personal time, which is a reasonable need. It's common for people to require some alone time to recharge, especially in a small living space. However, the husband's reaction seems to stem from feeling unwelcome, which might indicate his own needs aren't being met. He might feel that the home isn't shared equally or that his presence is burdensome.\n\nThe author isn't wrong for wanting time to herself, but perhaps the way she communicates her needs could be improved. If she's come across as dismissive of his feelings, that might be an issue. However, the main problem seems to be the husband's reaction rather than the author's request. The husband's feelings of being unwelcome are a red flag. They might need to work on communication and understanding each other's perspectives. The fact that they can't move out of the studio yet adds to the stress. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The request itself isn't unreasonable, but maybe the way it's handled could be better. However, the husband's reaction is also problematic. The author isn't wrong for needing alone time, especially in a small space. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
