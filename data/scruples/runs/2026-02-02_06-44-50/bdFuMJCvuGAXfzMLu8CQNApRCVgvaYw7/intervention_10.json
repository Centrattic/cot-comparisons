I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple living in a studio apartment where the woman wants some alone time and has asked her husband to leave for a few hours. The husband is upset, feeling unwelcome, and the author is wondering if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author values alone time and the current setup doesn't allow for it. Studio apartments are small, so privacy is limited. She works full-time, he works part-time. She's trying to carve out personal time, which is understandable. People need space to recharge, so her request isn't unreasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband feels hurt and not welcome. He's not working much, so maybe he's feeling like his presence is a burden. He might be struggling with self-esteem or feeling isolated. His job being unstable adds stress. Maybe he's used to having the apartment to himself all week and now he's feeling excluded when she's home.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author is expressing her need, but the husband is reacting emotionally. It's possible she didn't communicate her needs clearly, or he's not processing the request without taking it personally. The husband's hurt feelings suggest he might feel like he's not a part of the household or that his presence is a problem.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? She's asking for her own time, which is a valid need. However, the way she's doing it might be causing the husband to feel unvalued. Maybe she could find a middle ground, like suggesting activities they both can enjoy or finding ways to create some separation without him leaving. The fact that he's home a lot and might not have many social outlets is another factor. His problem with the timing (Saturday vs. other days) suggests he's not using his time effectively, which could be a point to discuss.\n\nThe author's mention of wanting to move when his job situation improves shows they're thinking about the future, but for now, they have to work with the current setup. The husband's reaction seems more about feeling excluded rather than the act of asking for time. It's possible he's not used to shared living and is struggling with the adjustment. \n\nSo, while the author has a valid need for alone time, the way she's handling it might not be the most considerate. It's a communication issue rather than a clear right or wrong. But the user thinks she's in the wrong, but I might lean towards she's not because her needs are legitimate, though she could approach it differently. However, the husband's feelings are also important. Maybe the real issue is their communication style. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because having alone time is valid, but the situation requires negotiation. Alternatively, if her request is causing unnecessary hurt without considering his feelings, maybe A. But I think it's more about needing better communication rather than her being wrong outright.\n"
