I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave their studio apartment for a few hours. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they live in a studio, so space is limited. The author values alone time, which she couldn't get with her husband always around. Her husband works part-time, so he's home more, and he's not really going out to meet friends. She wants a couple hours of privacy, but when she asks him to go out, he feels hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome. He's also pushing for specifics on how long and what he should do. \n\nShe mentioned they're planning a day trip on Sunday. He's upset if he can't go Saturday as well, even though he's home alone on Friday and Monday. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she's asking for personal time, which is reasonable. The husband's work situation is unstable, so maybe he feels his place in the home isn't secure. The studio apartment is limiting, and moving isn't feasible right now. The husband's reaction might stem from feeling his home isn't his, leading to hurt feelings when asked to leave.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? She's asking for something basic\u2014alone time. It's not unreasonable. Her husband's response seems overly sensitive and possibly not considering her need for space. However, maybe she could communicate better, explain her needs without making him feel unwelcome. But the core issue is her right to personal time. The husband's reaction seems more about his insecurity than her request being wrong. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's room for negotiation. She could work on communication, but her need for space isn't invalid. The husband needs to manage his feelings and not take it personally. The author isn't wrong for asking, especially given the living situation. The problem is more about how he's responding rather than her request itself.\n"
