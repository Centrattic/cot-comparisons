I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault for making their husband leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment, which means very little privacy. The husband works part-time (10-20 hours a week) and doesn't go out much or meet friends often. The author feels the need for alone time to read or watch shows without the husband around. They mention that they value alone time and loved living alone before he moved in two years ago. \n\nWhen she asks him to go out, he gets hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. He wants specific hours and what to do when his friends can't come. She's also planning a day trip on Sunday and he's upset because he's home alone on Friday and Monday too, implying he doesn't get enough time. They can't move to a bigger place because of financial issues due to his unstable job and high city costs.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author needs alone time, which is reasonable, but the husband feels excluded or unwelcome. The husband's job is part-time and unstable, making financial moves hard. The author is asking if she's wrong for wanting this time.\n\nFrom what I know, needing personal space is normal. But the husband's reaction is about feeling not welcome. However, the author's reasoning is that they live in a small space, and she's working full-time. The husband has more free time and isn't meeting friends much. The author isn't asking for a lot\u2014just a couple of hours on a Saturday. The husband's response seems to be about feeling rejected or not part of the home, maybe due to low self-esteem or not adjusting to the living situation.\n\nBut is the author wrong? Well, the husband moved into her apartment two years ago. It's not his apartment, so maybe he should expect that the space is hers. However, it's a shared living situation, so expecting some time together is normal. However, the author's need for alone time is valid. The problem arises in how the husband reacts negatively. If the author is setting a boundary that's reasonable (like a few hours on a day where he's already home alone), she's not wrong. The husband's feelings are valid, but he should also respect her need for space. \n\nThe husband's job situation and lack of socializing might contribute to his feeling of needing to be with her all the time. But the author isn't wrong for wanting solitude. The real issue might be communication. They might need to find a compromise, like the husband finding activities on his own or them planning time apart more regularly. The author isn't in the wrong for setting this boundary, especially if she's explaining her needs clearly. The husband's reaction is a problem, but that doesn't make the author wrong. So the answer is B (No).\n"
