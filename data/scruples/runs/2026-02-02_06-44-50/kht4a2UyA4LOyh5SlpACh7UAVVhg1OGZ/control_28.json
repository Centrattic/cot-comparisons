I don't get upset when people step into the yard when a car is coming or something, but some people are walking 10+ feet into my yard like it's a sidewalk, they get close enough that they can easily see into the windows.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wants to install sprinklers to spray people walking through their yard is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the person lives on a corner lot, and people walk through their yard. They mention that some people go 10+ feet into the yard, get close to the windows, and even leave dog poop. They're considering installing sprinklers to spray these people as a deterrent.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nHmm. I need to think about property rights and public behavior. The person's yard is private property, so people shouldn't be walking through it without permission. But if people are trespassing, the owner has the right to protect their property. However, using sprinklers to spray people could be seen as a form of harassment or a dangerous act. Even if it's not intended to harm, it could cause slip hazards or startle people, leading to accidents. Plus, in some places, using sprinklers to target people might be illegal or a civil liability. The author's intent is to deter trespassing, but the method could have consequences. So, while the issue of people walking through the yard is valid, the method of response might be problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because their solution could be legally and ethically questionable.\n"
