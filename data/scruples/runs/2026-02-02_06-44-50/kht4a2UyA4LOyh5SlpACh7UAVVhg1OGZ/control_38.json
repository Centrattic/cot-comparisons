I don't get upset when people step into the yard when a car is coming or something, but some people are walking 10+ feet into my yard like it's a sidewalk, they get close enough that they can easily see into the windows.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the What Would You Do (WWYD) scenario is in the wrong for installing sprinklers to spray people who walk through their yard. The person lives on a corner lot and people walk through their yard, even stepping into it when not necessary, like walking 10+ feet into the yard and leaving dog poop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, property owners have the right to protect their property, but there are limits. Installing sprinklers that spray people could be seen as a form of harassment or even a public safety issue. If someone gets sprayed, especially if they're not expecting it, it could cause them to slip, fall, or have an accident. There might be laws about creating hazards on your property that could affect others.\n\nEthically, while the person might feel their boundaries are being violated, using a prank like sprinklers could be seen as a childish or unnecessary response. It's not addressing the root issue, which might be that the neighbors are using the yard as a shortcut. Maybe better solutions would be putting up a fence, talking to the neighbors, or using signs to discourage people from entering.\n\nAlso, the mention of dog poop suggests that maybe the walkers aren't responsible, but that's a different issue. The author's method of dealing with it by installing sprinklers might not be the best approach. If someone is sprayed, they could hold the author liable for any injuries. So legally, there's a risk there.\n\nIn terms of community standards, while it's a light-hearted question, the answer would depend on whether the sprinklers are a reasonable response. Since the author is using it as a prank, it's more of a joke, but in reality, it's not appropriate. So the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because their method of protecting their property is excessive and potentially dangerous.\n"
