I don't get upset when people step into the yard when a car is coming or something, but some people are walking 10+ feet into my yard like it's a sidewalk, they get close enough that they can easily see into the windows.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong for installing sprinklers to spray people walking through their yard. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the person lives on a corner lot and people are walking through their yard frequently. They mention that some people enter up to 10 feet, which is a significant portion of the yard. The person is frustrated because this leads to privacy issues (people can see into the windows) and dog poop. They want to install sprinklers to deter this behavior.\n\nNow, the main question is if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but wants to know my take. Let's consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, a property owner has the right to protect their property. However, installing something like sprinklers that actively spray people could be seen as a form of harassment or intentional infliction of harm. Even if it's not physical harm, it's a deliberate action to cause discomfort. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, there are laws against creating a nuisance. A sprinkler system that unexpectedly sprays people might constitute a civil nuisance, especially if it's causing inconvenience or harm. Also, if the sprinklers are set to go off when someone enters the property, it could be argued that it's a trap, which might have legal implications. \n\nEthically, while the author has a right to privacy and property, using a method that could startle or harm others might be considered excessive. The alternative solutions like putting up a fence, signs, or talking to neighbors might be more appropriate and less confrontational. \n\nThe author's reasoning is understandable\u2014people are encroaching on their property. But the method chosen (sprinklers to spray) could be seen as an overreaction. There's a balance between protecting one's property and ensuring that others aren't harmed or harassed. \n\nAlso, considering the context of the \"WIBTA\" (Would I Be Termed a [Cranky]) question, the community's perspective would likely side against the sprinkler idea because it's proactive in causing discomfort. People might find it unreasonable even if they understand the frustration. \n\nSo, putting it together, the author is probably in the wrong because the method they're considering could be legally problematic and ethically questionable, even if their concerns about privacy and property are valid.\n"
