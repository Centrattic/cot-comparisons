I don't think I'm your typical cranky old man, but a lot of people really push my boundaries. I don't get upset when people step into the yard when a car is coming or something, but some people are walking 10+ feet into my yard like it's a sidewalk, they get close enough that they can easily see into the windows.  I occasionally find dog poop in my yard as well. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wants to install sprinklers to spray people walking into their yard is in the wrong. The question is whether they should be blamed for this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person lives on a corner lot and people are regularly walking through their yard. They mention that people are entering up to 10 feet, getting close to windows, and even leaving dog poop. The person feels their boundaries are being pushed.\n\nNow, the main issue is about installing sprinklers to spray people. Legally, in many places, setting up something that could harm or startle people might be a problem. Even if it's water, if someone slips and falls, the property owner could be held liable. So there's a potential for legal issues here.\n\nEthically, it's about respecting others' actions and your own property. While the person has the right to control their property, using a prank like a water sprinkler could be seen as a form of harassment or creating a dangerous situation. It's a way of asserting boundaries, but in a possibly aggressive manner.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of community norms. People generally expect a certain level of civility. If neighbors are using the yard as a shortcut, maybe the solution should involve communication, like setting up a fence or talking to the community, rather than a surprise water spray. The prank could escalate tensions and lead to conflicts.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical angles, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong. They're using a potentially harmful method to enforce their boundaries, which could lead to consequences for them and isn't a peaceful resolution.\n"
