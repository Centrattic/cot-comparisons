I don't get upset when people step into the yard when a car is coming or something, but some people are walking 10+ feet into my yard like it's a sidewalk, they get close enough that they can easily see into the windows.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong if they install sprinklers to spray people walking through their yard.\n\nThe scenario is that the person lives on a corner lot where people often walk through their yard, sometimes 10 feet in. They mention finding dog poop, which implies others are using their yard as a path. The author is considering installing sprinklers as a deterrent. \n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong by doing this. The question is whether their action is justified or if they're overstepping. \n\nIn terms of property rights, the author owns their land, so they have the right to control who enters. However, if the people walking through have an easement or if it's a public right-of-way, that's different. The post doesn't mention that, so maybe it's private property.\n\nBut the issue is using sprinklers to spray people. That's active retaliation. Even if the yard is private, intentionally spraying people could be seen as harmful or malicious. Sprinklers are typically for irrigation, but using them to surprise people with water might cause alarm or injury. There's a legal concept called \"nuisance\" where actions interfere with others' use of their property. If the yard is adjacent, maybe the walkers have a right to pass if it's part of a path. But if it's private, the author can set boundaries.\n\nHowever, the method of using sprinklers to spray people might be excessive. It's a form of harassment or prank, which could lead to liability if someone slips or is startled. Even if the author isn't wrong for wanting to keep people out, the sprinkler method is potentially dangerous and not a proportionate response. There might be better solutions, like building a fence, talking to neighbors, or informing local authorities if it's a public path. \n\nThe author's justification is that people are encroaching, but using a prank to deter them could be seen as crossing a line. So the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because the method is inappropriate.\n"
