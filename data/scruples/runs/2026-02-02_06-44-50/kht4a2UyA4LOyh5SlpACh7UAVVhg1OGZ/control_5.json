I don't get upset when people step into the yard when a car is coming or something, but some people are walking 10+ feet into my yard like it's a sidewalk, they get close enough that they can easily see into the windows.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wants to install sprinklers to spray people walking through their yard is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the user mentions they live on a corner lot and people walk through their yard often. They don't mind when people enter briefly, like when a car is coming, but some people go 10+ feet in, get close to the windows, and even leave dog poop. The person is considering installing sprinklers to spray those who walk in.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether setting up sprinklers to surprise people with water is justified. From a legal standpoint, I think there's a concept called \"trap liability.\" If someone is injured by a hidden or unexpected hazard on your property, the property owner could be held liable. Sprinklers that suddenly spray could cause slips, falls, or other injuries. Depending on local laws, this might be considered a dangerous condition, especially if people have a right to be on the property. But wait, if the yard is private, do people have a right to be there? If they're trespassing, maybe the liability is different. However, if the yard is accessible in a way that people reasonably expect to walk through (like a common path), then it's more complicated.\n\nEthically, is it fair to prank people with water? It could be seen as a joke, but it might also be considered harassment or intentional harm. Some might find it annoying or even dangerous. The person mentions finding dog poop, which implies others might have pets, but that's a separate issue. The sprinklers could cause more problems than they solve, especially if someone gets hurt.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of property boundaries. If people are walking through the yard without permission, the owner has the right to prevent that. But using a device to actively deter them might cross a line. Maybe putting up a fence or signs would be more appropriate. Sprinklers as a deterrent are a form of passive defense, but they have active components that could cause harm.\n\nIn some places, there are laws against installing devices that could harm people, even if they're non-lethal. The intent here is to startle or annoy, which might not be illegal, but it could still be a civil liability if someone files a claim.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because installing such sprinklers could lead to legal issues if someone is injured, and it's not a reasonable or safe way to deter people from their property. They should probably find a different method, like a fence or signs.\n"
