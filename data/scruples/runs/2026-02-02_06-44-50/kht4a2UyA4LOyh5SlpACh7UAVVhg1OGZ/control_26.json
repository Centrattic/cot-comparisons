I don't get upset when people step into the yard when a car is coming or something, but some people are walking 10+ feet into my yard like it's a sidewalk, they get close enough that they can easily see into the windows.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether installing sprinklers to spray people walking through their yard is justified.\n\nFirst, the user is on a corner lot where people often walk through their yard. They mention that some people walk 10+ feet into the yard, close enough to see into the windows, and even leave dog poop. The user is considering installing sprinklers to deter this behavior.\n\nSo, the main points to consider are property rights versus public safety and reasonable use. The user owns their yard, so they have the right to control access. However, if the walkway is considered a public pathway or an established informal trail, there might be issues. But since it's their property, they can set boundaries.\n\nBut installing sprinklers that spray people could be seen as a defense mechanism. The problem is whether it's excessive or dangerous. Sprinklers might startle people, cause slips or falls, leading to injury. Even if it's a prank, it could be considered a safety hazard. Additionally, some places have laws against sprinklers that can surprise or harm people, especially if it's a known pathway.\n\nAlso, the user's frustration is understandable with people encroaching and leaving mess. However, using a pranklike measure might not be the best solution. They might be advised to communicate with neighbors, put up signs, or use barriers instead.\n\nIn terms of legal liability, if someone gets hurt from the sprinklers, the property owner could be held responsible. So even if the intent is to deter, the method could be problematic. There's a difference between using non-lethal deterrents and something that could cause harm.\n\nAnother angle: the user isn't using force but a prank. However, pranks on public paths are generally frowned upon. If the yard is adjacent to a sidewalk or a commonly used path, then the sprinklers could be seen as an unreasonable obstruction or dangerous.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because the method could be dangerous and legally risky, even if the intent is to protect their property. They might need a safer, more conventional solution.\n"
