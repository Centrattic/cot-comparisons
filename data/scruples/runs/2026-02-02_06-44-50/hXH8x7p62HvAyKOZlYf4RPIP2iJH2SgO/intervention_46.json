I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a long-time friend who didn't invite them to her wedding, and the author is considering not attending because they weren't chosen as a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, the author was surprised they weren't told first via Facebook. They had a conversation where they assumed they'd be the maid of honor, but the friend chose someone else. The author feels hurt, especially since they were the maid of honor in their own wedding. Now, they're thinking about not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nSo, the key points here are about expectations and the value of the friendship. The author might feel they deserve a place in the wedding, but the friend has the right to choose her own wedding party. The author is considering skipping the wedding to avoid embarrassment and as a way to move on. \n\nIs it wrong to not attend because you're not in the wedding party? Well, attending a friend's wedding is a personal choice. The author is facing emotional hurt and financial considerations. They also mention not wanting to stay in contact after, which shows they're already distancing themselves. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. It's their choice whether to attend, especially if they're not in the wedding party. The friend didn't do anything wrong by not inviting them, and the author isn't obligated to attend. Not attending might be a way to protect their feelings. So the answer would be B.\n"
