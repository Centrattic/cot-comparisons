I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who isn't being invited as a bridesmaid, even though they were the maid of honor in her friend's wedding two years ago. The friend found out via Facebook, which was a surprise, and then later discovered that the maid of honor role went to another childhood friend. Now the person is considering not attending the wedding because they aren't in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations. Weddings are typically big events where the bride chooses her wedding party based on her current relationships and how she wants to represent her life now. The fact that the original questioner was the maid of honor in her friend's wedding two years ago doesn't necessarily mean the friend is obligated to reciprocate. People's relationships can change, even if they've been friends for a long time. The questioner mentions they've drifted apart in recent years, which might explain why the friend chose someone else.\n\nThe key issue here is whether not attending the wedding is an appropriate response. The person is hurt and feels slighted but is considering not attending as a way to signal that they don't want a one-sided friendship. Is that a valid reaction? Well, weddings are personal, and while it's understandable to feel hurt, attending is traditionally seen as a kind gesture, especially for someone who was a close friend in the past. Not attending could be perceived as holding a grudge, which might be seen as the questioner's fault because they're letting past hurt affect the current event.\n\nHowever, there's also the argument that the friend didn't reach out first to inform the person about the wedding, which is a red flag. If the friend had kept the questioner in the loop, maybe the hurt would have been lessened, and the questioner might have been more inclined to attend regardless. The fact that the friend found out via Facebook first is a point against the friend. But the questioner's decision to not attend because they weren't in the wedding party could be seen as holding onto that slight, which might not be fair.\n\nSocially, it's expected to attend a close friend's wedding even if you're not in the wedding party. Not attending might hurt the friend's feelings further. The questioner is trying to make a statement about the friendship being one-sided, but maybe the right approach would be to attend, express their feelings gracefully, and then decide whether to maintain contact. If the friendship has already drifted, maybe not attending is a way to let go, but that's more about personal choice than being in the wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they decide not to attend solely because they weren't in the wedding party, that's a personal choice, but socially, it's expected to attend. However, the friend's failure to inform the questioner first is a valid issue. But the author's main reason for not attending is the exclusion from the wedding party. Given that, is the author wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. But traditionally, attending a friend's wedding is expected regardless of being in the party. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not attending, even if they're hurt. Alternatively, if the friendship is already damaged, it's their right to choose not to attend.\n\nHmm. I think the answer hinges on social expectations versus personal feelings. The AITA community often values attending weddings even without being in the party, so the author might be seen as being in the wrong (A). But some might say it's their choice (B). The initial exclusion and lack of communication from the friend complicates things. However, the author is making a choice based on their feelings. I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because attending is expected, and not attending because of exclusion is a personal decision that could be seen as petty. But maybe there's a different perspective. I need to check similar AITA posts. Usually, people are encouraged to attend for the sake of the friendship. So, likely answer is A.\n"
