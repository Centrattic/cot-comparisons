I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be in the wedding party. They were surprised they weren't told first and assumed they'd be the maid of honor since their friend was the maid of honor in their wedding. Now they're hurt because their friend chose someone else and other people who aren't as close. They're considering not attending because it's a hassle and they don't want a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether attending the wedding is expected. Traditionally, close friends are invited even if they're not in the wedding party. So the author might feel slighted, but the friend might have chosen others for her party. The author's reasoning is that they don't want to attend if they're not in the party, which could be seen as holding a grudge. But the author also mentions they're not going to stay in contact, which might be a bigger issue.\n\nThe user's question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on social norms and friendship expectations. Attending a friend's wedding is usually considered important, regardless of being in the party. Not attending might hurt the friend and could be seen as selfish. However, the author's feelings are valid because they were excluded from the party. The decision to not attend could be justified if they feel unappreciated, but it might strain the friendship. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have valid feelings, but some might argue that attending is expected regardless. However, the answer here is B (No), as the author's decision is based on personal feelings and practical considerations, and the friend's actions might have contributed to the situation. The friendship seems to have drifted, and the author is prioritizing their own boundaries.\n"
