I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend not being invited to her best friend's wedding as a bridesmaid, despite expecting to be the maid of honor since the friend was her maid of honor in her own wedding. The author is considering not attending the wedding because she's hurt and feels the friendship is one-sided now.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and her friend have known each other for over 15 years. The friend found out about the wedding on Facebook, which already might have caused some hurt. Then, when the author assumed she'd be the maid of honor, but the friend chose someone else, even though the author had been the maid of honor in her own wedding. The author feels hurt and is considering not attending the wedding because she's not in the wedding party, even though it's not a major financial hardship. She also mentions wanting to focus on friends who want her around and not stay in contact with the friend after.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nThe main ethical dilemma here is about social expectations and personal feelings. Weddings are significant events, and it's common for people to expect close friends to attend, even if they aren't in the wedding party. The author's decision not to attend because she's not in the wedding party could be seen as holding a grudge or being petty, especially since the friend might still value their friendship despite not selecting her for a specific role. On the other hand, the friend didn't inform her about the wedding first, excluded her from the wedding party, and the author has valid feelings of being slighted. \n\nBut in terms of social norms, attending a friend's wedding is often considered important regardless of being in the party. The author is choosing not to attend due to hurt feelings, which might be seen as inconsiderate. However, if the friendship has indeed become one-sided, the author's decision might be justified. The key here is whether the author is overreacting or if her feelings are valid. \n\nThe friend didn't ask the author to be in the wedding party, which can be a hurtful exclusion. The author has every right to feel hurt, but choosing not to attend because of it could be seen as cutting off contact without attending a major life event. However, the author also mentions not wanting a one-sided friendship and plans to stop contact, so maybe the decision is more about moving on than just attending the wedding. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't necessarily doing something wrong, but her decision could be seen as holding a grudge. However, considering her feelings and the friend's actions, she might not be in the wrong. But traditionally, weddings are expected to be attended by close friends even if not in the party. So, maybe the answer is A, but I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, B could be correct if her feelings are valid and she's choosing to prioritize her self-respect.\n\nWait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong for deciding not to attend. If the author's primary reason is not attending because she's not in the wedding party, that's a bit self-centered. The friend has the right to choose her wedding party, and the author's presence at the wedding is separate from that. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for letting her hurt feelings affect her attending the wedding. On the other hand, if the friendship has already deteriorated, maybe it's a valid choice. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because attending a friend's wedding is generally expected, unless there are significant issues. The author is allowing her hurt feelings to dictate her attendance, which could be seen as petty. However, the friend didn't inform her first, which is also a problem. But the core issue is the author's decision to not attend due to exclusion. So, maybe the answer is A.\n"
