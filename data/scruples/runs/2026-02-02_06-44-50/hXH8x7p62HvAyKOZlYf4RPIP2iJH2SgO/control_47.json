I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding because they weren't made a bridesmaid. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author has been friends with this person for 15 years. They were the maid of honor at the friend's wedding two years ago. The friend found out about her own wedding through Facebook, which the author felt was unexpected. Then, the author noticed that another childhood friend was chosen as maid of honor, and other friends not close recently were in the wedding party. The author is hurt but understands the friend's choice. Now, they're considering not attending because they aren't in the wedding party, which would involve some financial and time costs, but not a huge hardship. They don't plan to stay in contact afterward.\n\nSo, the key points here are the friend's actions versus the author's feelings. The friend didn't invite the author to the wedding party, which is her right since it's her day. The author is upset but acknowledges the friend's right to choose. However, the author is considering not attending because they feel slighted. \n\nI need to consider social norms. Typically, attending a close friend's wedding is expected, regardless of being in the wedding party. Even if you're not a bridesmaid, attending is seen as respecting the couple. But the author argues they don't want a one-sided friendship and will cut contact afterward. \n\nBut does that justify not attending the wedding? Weddings are significant events where people expect their close friends to be present, not just for the ceremony but also for the social aspect. The author's decision could be seen as a reaction to being excluded from the wedding party, which might come off as petty. However, the author is hurt and feels the friend didn't prioritize them, especially since the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. \n\nAnother angle: The friend might not have realized the importance of inviting the author to the wedding party, or perhaps their priorities shifted. The author's feelings are valid, but not attending the wedding might be seen as cutting off the friend completely, which could be harsh. However, the author is within their rights to decide not to attend if they feel it's not worth the emotional or financial cost. \n\nSocially, there's an expectation to attend a close friend's wedding, but if the friend didn't include them in the wedding party, maybe the author has a valid reason to feel disrespected. However, not attending could be seen as taking a stand, but it might also hurt the friend. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is overreacting to not being in the wedding party. Since the friend did include others who aren't as close, maybe the author has a point in feeling slighted. But attending the wedding is a separate matter from being in the wedding party. The author could attend without being in the party, but they choose not to. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the author's decision is based on feeling disrespected and they are choosing to cut ties, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, if the expectation is that you attend a close friend's wedding regardless, then they might be. But the question is whether they are in the wrong for not attending. \n\nGiven that the author is hurt and the friend didn't reach out to them, maybe the fault isn't entirely on the author. The friend might have mishandled the situation by not informing them and not including them. The author's decision to not attend could be a reaction to that, which might be understandable. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have a right to their feelings and their choice to prioritize their own well-being and set boundaries if they feel the friendship is one-sided. Not attending, while potentially hurtful, is their decision to make. They aren't obligated to attend if they feel it's not worth the emotional cost, especially if they plan to disengage from the friendship afterward.\n"
