I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The author is a 15-year friend who wasn't asked to be in the wedding party and is considering not attending the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was surprised not to be told first via Facebook. Their friend was the maid of honor at their wedding two years ago, so the author might have expected the same role here. However, the friend chose a childhood best friend instead, which caused hurt. The author also mentions that they've drifted apart in recent years. \n\nThe author is considering not attending because they're not in the wedding party and feel the friendship is one-sided. They plan to cut contact after the wedding. The key points here are the friend's actions of not informing the author first, the uninvited role in the wedding party, and the author's decision not to attend.\n\nI should evaluate social norms around weddings. Typically, weddings are joyous events, and the author's friend might have expected the author to attend regardless of being in the wedding party. Even if they've drifted apart, a long-term friendship might still warrant attendance. The author's decision to not attend could be seen as a refusal to celebrate the friend's big day, which might be hurtful.\n\nHowever, the author's perspective is that the friendship has become one-sided. They might feel undervalued, especially since they were not even informed first. The friend's decision to exclude them from the wedding party could be a significant emotional trigger. The author's plan to stop contact afterward might make their decision to not attend a form of emotional boundary.\n\nBut in social terms, attending a friend's wedding is generally considered respectful and supportive, even if you're not part of the wedding party. The author's reasoning is based on personal hurt and feeling unappreciated, but the friend might not see it that way. The author's decision could be seen as cutting off a long-time friend over a misunderstanding or unmet expectations, which might place the blame on the author for not attending.\n\nOn the other hand, if the friendship has indeed become one-sided, the author's choice to not attend is a self-respecting decision. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. The key is whether not attending is an appropriate response. Socially, attending is expected unless there's a major conflict. The author is making a choice based on personal feelings, which is their right, but the friend might feel the author is being petty or withholding support.\n\nConsidering all angles, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's an argument that attending is a kind gesture. However, the friend's failure to inform them first and exclude them from the wedding party might justify the author's hurt feelings and decision. The answer could hinge on whether the author's response is proportionate. Since they're not in the wedding party, maybe the expectation to attend is still there, but the author's feelings are valid. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is setting boundaries after feeling slighted.\n"
