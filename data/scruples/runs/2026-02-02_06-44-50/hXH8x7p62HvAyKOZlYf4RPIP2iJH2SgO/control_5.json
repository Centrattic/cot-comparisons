I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The friend in question is getting married, and the author thought they would be part of the wedding party since they did the same for their friend's wedding two years ago. The friend ended up choosing someone else as the maid of honor, and the author wasn't included in the wedding party. The author is hurt but understands it's the friend's choice. However, they're considering not attending the wedding because they feel it's a one-sided friendship now and aren't interested in attending if they aren't part of the wedding party.\n\nNow, the key points here are about expectations and the nature of the friendship. The author and their friend have been friends for 15 years, which is a long time. The assumption was that the author would be in the wedding party, similar to how they were at the friend's wedding. However, the friend chose someone else, possibly because their relationship has drifted. The author now feels slighted and is considering not attending, which could be seen as a way to cut off a one-sided friendship.\n\nI need to think about social norms here. Attending a wedding is typically a gesture of goodwill and support for the couple, even if you're not part of the wedding party. However, the author is arguing that attending would cost money and time, and they feel it's not worth it if they aren't being included as a bridesmaid. They also mention that they don't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel it's unfair not to be asked, especially given their history. On the other hand, the wedding is the friend's choice regarding the wedding party. The author's decision not to attend could be seen as a response to feeling excluded. But is it wrong to not attend if they're not part of the wedding party? It's important to consider if there's an expectation that all close friends attend regardless of their role.\n\nIn some cultures or social circles, attending a close friend's wedding is expected, regardless of being in the wedding party. The author might be avoiding the wedding to express hurt feelings, which could be seen as a justified reaction. However, others might argue that attending is a way to support the friend despite being excluded from the wedding party, even if it's hurtful.\n\nAnother angle is the author's intention to cut off contact after this. If they plan to stop the friendship, maybe not attending is a way to set boundaries. But if they're cutting off contact because they're not in the wedding party, that could be seen as a harsh reaction. However, the author is hurt and feels the friendship is no longer balanced.\n\nI should also consider if the friend's actions were inconsiderate. The friend didn't inform the author of the marriage first, which is a red flag. Not telling a close friend first and then excluding them from the wedding party could be seen as thoughtless. The author was hurt and reached out, but the friend didn't include them in the wedding party. That might contribute to the author's decision to not attend.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong might depend on cultural norms and personal expectations. If attending a close friend's wedding is expected regardless of being in the wedding party, then the author might be in the wrong. But if the author feels the friendship has become one-sided and is cutting off contact, their decision not to attend could be justified. However, the author's main argument is about the cost and effort not being worth it when they feel slighted. The friend's failure to inform them first and exclude them from the wedding party could support the author's stance. So, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong because their feelings are valid, and attending could be seen as unnecessary given the circumstances.\n"
