I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend not being in the wedding party and considering not attending the wedding.\n\nFirst, the author was surprised when the friend announced the wedding on Facebook instead of telling them first. Then, they thought they would be the maid of honor since they were the maid of honor in the friend's wedding two years ago. But the friend chose another childhood friend instead. The author is hurt but understands the drift. Now, they're considering not attending because they're not in the wedding party, even though they don't have a major problem with paying for the trip or time off.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't want a one-sided friendship and plan to cut off contact after this. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate whether that's the case.\n\nWeddings are significant events, and not attending might be seen as a big deal. Even if the friend didn't include them in the wedding party, attending could be a sign of support for their friend. The author is making a choice based on their feelings of being slighted, but maybe that's jumping to conclusions. The friend might have had reasons that aren't apparent, like family dynamics or personal preferences. The author's plan not to attend could be seen as cutting off contact without giving closure or talking to the friend directly. It's possible that the friend didn't realize the impact of not including them in the party or the announcement method.\n\nHowever, the author did reach out and talk about the wedding plans. The friend's decision to choose others might not have been intentional to hurt. The author might be overreacting by not attending. On the other hand, if the friend didn't value the relationship enough to include them, maybe the author is justified in wanting to distance themselves. But the author hasn't actually spoken to the friend about this decision, so they might be acting out of hurt feelings without resolving the issue.\n\nIn similar AITA scenarios, people often advise attending the wedding regardless of not being in the party, as it's a milestone event. The author's choice to not attend without discussing it further might be seen as inconsiderate. But if the friendship has already drifted, maybe the author is protecting their own feelings, which is understandable.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author is holding a grudge over not being in the wedding party and using that as a reason to not attend. Weddings are about celebrating the couple, so attending is usually expected unless there's a serious issue. The author's plan to cut off contact might be extreme, but their reasoning is based on the one-sidedness. However, the author hasn't given the friend a chance to explain or mend the friendship. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not attending without a direct conflict and for cutting off contact preemptively.\n"
