I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has known them for over 15 years. The author was surprised by the wedding announcement on Facebook, expecting to be told first. They assumed they'd be the maid of honor since their friend was their maid of honor at their wedding two years ago. But the friend chose a childhood best friend instead, and then the author noticed other people in the wedding party they're not close with anymore. The author is hurt but understands the friend's choice. Now, they're considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party and find it a hassle to travel. They don't want a one-sided friendship anymore and plan to cut contact.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about expectations, friendship dynamics, and personal choice regarding attending events.\n\nThe author was hurt by not being chosen, which is understandable. They had assumed a role similar to what their friend did for them. But the friend made different choices, maybe due to recent drift. The author isn't attending because they feel slighted and it's a hassle. They're not attending a close friend's wedding, but they're in a different state. Is that wrong?\n\nIn many cultures, attending a close friend's wedding is considered important, regardless of whether you're in the wedding party. So, there might be social expectations here. However, the author is making a choice based on their feelings and the effort required. They also mention not wanting a one-sided friendship, which suggests they feel undervalued. \n\nBut the answer depends on perspective. The author isn't obligated to attend. It's their choice. However, the potential downside is damaging the friendship. But the author is already planning to cut contact regardless. So, is it wrong to not attend? If the author is following their heart and setting boundaries, maybe not. But some might argue that attending is a sign of respect and support, regardless of being in the wedding party. \n\nThe friend didn't inform them first, which is a separate issue. The author's hurt feelings are valid, but they're choosing not to attend. The main question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the author is making a personal choice and the friend has already made different choices in the relationship, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, some might say that attending a wedding is a key part of friendship, so not attending could be seen as wrong. \n\nBut considering the author's reasoning\u2014hurt feelings, not wanting to invest time and money for a strained friendship\u2014it's a personal decision. They aren't being malicious, just prioritizing their own well-being. So, I think the answer is B.\n"
