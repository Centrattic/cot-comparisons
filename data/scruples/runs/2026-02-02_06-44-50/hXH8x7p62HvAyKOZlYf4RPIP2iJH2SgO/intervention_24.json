I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the question is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding. The author is a friend of 15 years who wasn't told about the wedding first and wasn't included in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in friendships. The author assumed they would be the maid of honor, especially since they were the maid of honor at their friend's wedding two years ago. But the friend chose someone else. The author feels hurt but understands the drift. Now, they're considering not attending because they aren't in the wedding party. \n\nIs attending a wedding a given even if you're not in the wedding party? I think generally, yes. Weddings are significant events, and friends often attend regardless of being part of the party. The cost and time might be a factor, but the author isn't in a position where they can't afford it\u2014it's a few states away, not impossible. \n\nThe author mentions not wanting to attend because they feel it's a one-sided friendship now. But ending contact might be a response to feeling ignored, but is it justified? The friend did reach out and talk about the wedding plans after the author congratulated. They might have drifted, but that doesn't mean the author should cut off contact entirely. \n\nThe key point is whether it's acceptable to skip the wedding. Most people would attend a close friend's wedding even if not part of the party. The author is making a choice based on hurt feelings, which is understandable, but maybe not the right choice. Not attending could be seen as cutting someone off during a major life event. \n\nAlso, the author wasn't excluded from the wedding entirely\u2014just not in the party. So they might still be invited as a guest. If they don't attend, are they punishing the friend? The friend might not have considered the author's feelings, but the author's response might be too harsh. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong). They should attend for the sake of the friendship, even if they're hurt. Not attending could be seen as inconsiderate, especially after 15 years of friendship. The author might need to address the hurt feelings in a different way, like talking to the friend, rather than skipping the wedding.\n"
