I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding after not being asked as a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend is getting married, and the author thought they would be the maid of honor or at least a bridesmaid because they were the maid of honor at the friend's wedding two years ago. However, the friend chose another childhood friend as the maid of honor and didn't include the author in the wedding party. The author feels hurt and is considering not attending the wedding because they're embarrassed and don't want a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nNow, the key points here are the friendship's history, the expectations of being in the wedding party, and the decision to not attend. The author mentions they've been friends for 15 years and that the friend found out about the wedding through Facebook, which the author found surprising. They might have expected to be informed first, similar to when they were the maid of honor. \n\nThe friend's choice to include others in the wedding party is her right, as it's her day. But the author's reaction is based on feeling slighted and not wanting to attend now that they aren't part of the bridal party. The question is whether this reaction is justified.\n\nWeddings are often seen as significant events where attending is expected, even if you're not in the party, because of the friendship's longevity. However, the author is also considering the cost and time involved. They're planning to cut contact after, which adds another layer.\n\nI need to assess if the author's feelings are valid. It's common to feel hurt when excluded from a wedding party, especially after being close. But is it wrong to not attend? Well, attending is a personal choice. While it's customary to attend for close friends, the author's decision is based on their own hurt feelings and desire not to maintain a one-sided relationship. They might be using the wedding as a way to end the friendship, which could be seen as harsh, but they have the right to their feelings.\n\nThe friend didn't communicate properly by not informing the author first, which might have contributed to the hurt. However, the author's main issue is not attending. The cost is a factor, but not the main one. The underlying issue is the friendship dynamics. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intentions and fairness. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling hurt, but deciding not to attend might be seen as a selfish response if the friendship has been long-term. However, if the friendship was already drifting, maybe it's a valid decision. The author isn't obligated to attend, but the question is whether it's the wrong choice.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (No), because the author is not in the wrong for choosing not to attend, especially given the hurt feelings and the friend's lack of communication. But some might argue that attending is expected regardless. However, since it's a personal choice, and the author is being honest about their feelings, it's more about their right to prioritize their own emotions.\n"
