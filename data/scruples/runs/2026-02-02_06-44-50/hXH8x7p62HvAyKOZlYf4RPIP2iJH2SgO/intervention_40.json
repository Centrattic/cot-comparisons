I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't chosen as a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and their friend have been friends for over 15 years. The author was surprised when they found out about the wedding on Facebook, expecting to be informed first. They also thought they'd be the maid of honor, especially since the friend was their maid of honor two years ago. When the friend chose someone else, the author felt hurt but understood they had drifted. Now, the author isn't in the wedding party at all, and they're considering not attending because of the expense and feeling slighted. They also mention they don't want a one-sided friendship anymore and plan to cut contact.\n\nThe key points here are the author's expectations versus reality. They expected a certain role in the wedding due to their past friendship and the reciprocal role. However, the friend made different choices, possibly due to changes in their relationship over the years. The author is now contemplating not attending, which is a personal decision based on their feelings of exclusion and the cost involved.\n\nI need to consider social norms and friendship expectations. Typically, attending a friend's wedding is customary, even if you're not in the wedding party, as it's a major life event. However, if the friendship has significantly deteriorated, it's understandable to want to distance oneself. The author mentions they don't plan to stay in contact, indicating the friendship is already on the rocks.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending. Some might argue that attending is important to show support regardless of being in the wedding party. Others might say that if the friendship is no longer balanced, it's reasonable to prioritize their time and money elsewhere.\n\nThe author's reasoning includes the cost and emotional discomfort. They feel hurt and embarrassed, so attending might be painful. They also value mutual effort in friendships and are choosing to focus on friends who reciprocate. This perspective suggests that their decision is based on self-respect and moving on from a one-sided relationship.\n\nHowever, some might see not attending as cutting the friend out completely, especially if there's no direct conflict. The friend might not even know about the author's resentment unless it's communicated. But since the author is already planning to cut contact, maybe not attending is a way to align their actions with their intent to move on.\n\nIn terms of the AITA framework, the author is not doing something malicious. They're making a personal choice based on their feelings and the state of the friendship. The wrong, if any, might be on the friend's side for not informing the author earlier or for not maintaining the friendship. But the question is about the author's actions.\n\nGiven that the author is making a decision that's in line with their values and the current state of their relationship, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong). They're choosing to protect their feelings and not invest in a friendship that's no longer reciprocal. While attending a wedding is a social norm, it's not a strict obligation, especially when the relationship has changed.\n"
