I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a long-time friend (over 15 years) who wasn't told about the wedding first. They found out on Facebook, which probably hurt. They assumed they'd be the maid of honor since their friend was their maid of honor in their wedding. Then they found out the friend chose someone else, a childhood best friend. The author feels hurt but understands they've drifted apart. Now, they're considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party and think it's a one-sided friendship now. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending.\n\nHmm. Let's look at the key points. The friend didn't inform them first, which is a red flag. Maybe they felt slighted. The author had a reasonable expectation based on past mutual roles. The friend's choice to include others who aren't close recently adds to the author's hurt. The author isn't in the wedding party and feels embarrassed. They don't want to attend, which costs money and time, and they're planning to cut contact. \n\nIs attending a wedding a social obligation? Typically, yes. Even if you're not in the wedding party, attending is seen as a sign of respect and support. But maybe if the relationship is deteriorating, it's a different story. The author mentions not wanting a one-sided friendship and not staying in contact. So they're already distancing themselves. In that case, not attending might be their way of closing the chapter.\n\nBut from a societal norm perspective, even if you're not in the wedding party, attending is expected unless there's a valid reason. The author's reason is feeling hurt and not wanting to attend a one-sided friendship. Is that valid? It's subjective. Some might say they have the right to prioritize their own feelings, especially if the friendship is ending. Others might say the friend's choice not to invite them to the wedding party was her decision, but the author should still attend for the sake of the long friendship.\n\nAlso, the fact that the friend didn't inform them first is a point in the author's favor. Maybe the friend was dismissive, which contributes to the author's decision. The author isn't refusing to attend out of spite but because they feel excluded and it's a financial burden. They understand it's the friend's day but feel it's not worth the effort now that the friendship is fading.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they don't attend, are they being selfish? Or are they protecting their own feelings? The answer might hinge on whether attending is seen as necessary versus a personal choice. Since the author is cutting contact, not attending might be a natural part of ending the friendship. But if they're being asked to attend, maybe they should. However, since they aren't in the wedding party, maybe the friend isn't expecting them to attend. The author is making a choice based on their current feelings and future intentions. \n\nI think the key here is that the author is not being malicious. They're hurt but trying to move on. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong). They have a right to their feelings and to decide how to spend their time and money, especially if they're ending the friendship.\n"
