I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the friend found out about the wedding on Facebook instead of being told directly. That's a red flag. The author thought they'd be the maid of honor because their friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. But then the friend chose someone else. The author is hurt but still expected to be a bridesmaid. Then, when they realized they weren't in the wedding party at all, they're considering not attending.\n\nThe author is thinking about not attending because it's a big expense and they feel slighted. They also mention wanting to focus on friends who value them. The question is whether they're in the wrong for this decision.\n\nI need to consider social norms. Usually, attending a friend's wedding is seen as important, even if you're not in the wedding party. But there are exceptions. If someone isn't in the wedding party, maybe they don't feel obligated. However, the friend didn't inform them directly, which is rude. The author was hurt that they found out on social media. That's a key point. The friend might have already done the wrong thing by not informing them first.\n\nAlso, the author is planning to cut off contact after this. That suggests they feel the friendship is one-sided. If the friendship has been drifting, maybe the author is justified in not attending. But culturally, weddings are big events, and not attending could be seen as a slight. However, given the circumstances, the author's feelings are valid. The friend's actions (not telling them first, not including them in the wedding party) might give the author a reason to not attend without being in the wrong.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because the friend's actions were inappropriate, and the author is justified in deciding not to attend. But I need to check if there's a point where the author is overreacting. But considering the friend didn't inform them directly and excluded them from the wedding party, the author's decision isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
