I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether they should attend their friend's wedding despite not being in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, the friend found out about the wedding on Facebook, which she was expecting to be told first. That's a red flag. She was the maid of honor at her friend's wedding two years ago, so she probably expected a similar role here. But her friend chose someone else. The author feels hurt and drifted apart, which they acknowledge. \n\nNow, the friend included other people who aren't close, which makes the author question why she wasn't in the wedding party. The author is considering not attending because it's not worth the cost and effort, plus they feel embarrassed. They also mention wanting to focus on friends who value them more and not continue a one-sided relationship.\n\nSo, the main points here are the expectations of being a bridesmaid, the friend's actions of not informing her first, and the decision to not attend. \n\nTraditionally, attending a friend's wedding is seen as a kind gesture, even if you're not in the wedding party. But the author feels it's a one-sided friendship now, so maybe they have a valid point. However, not attending might be seen as cutting ties, which could be hurtful. \n\nBut the friend didn't even inform her first, which is a breach of etiquette. The author was the maid of honor before, so expecting a role here is reasonable. The friend's actions might have been inconsiderate. If the author isn't attending, maybe it's justified given the friend's lack of communication and the strained relationship. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because the friend didn't act appropriately. The decision to not attend is a response to the friend's actions. So the answer is B.\n"
