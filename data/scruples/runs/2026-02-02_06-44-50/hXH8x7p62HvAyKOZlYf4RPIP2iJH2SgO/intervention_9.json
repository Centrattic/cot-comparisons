I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a friend's wedding. The author has been friends with this person for 15 years, and when the friend got engaged, the author assumed they would be the maid of honor because the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding two years ago. But then the friend chose someone else for the maid of honor. The author thought they'd still be a bridesmaid, but when they checked Facebook, they realized they weren't even in the wedding party. Now, the author is considering not attending the wedding because they're hurt and don't want to attend if they aren't part of the party. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend didn't tell them first, which was a surprise. Maybe they were busy or forgot, but that's a point of hurt. The author felt they were close enough to be told first. Then, when the author assumed they'd be in the wedding party, especially since they reciprocated the role in their own wedding, but the friend chose others. The author is now deciding not to attend, which seems harsh, but maybe they feel justified.\n\nIs attending a wedding a social obligation even if you're not in the wedding party? Typically, yes. Weddings are big events, and even if you're not part of the planning or the party, attending is expected if you're invited, especially if you're a close friend. But maybe the author feels that not being in the wedding party makes attending awkward or not worth it. The author is also planning to cut contact with the friend, which suggests they feel the friendship is one-sided.\n\nBut is cutting contact over not being in the wedding party excessive? Maybe. Maybe the friend didn't realize how important it was to the author. The author could have talked to the friend about their feelings instead of just deciding to not attend and cut ties. It's possible that the author is overreacting, but it's also possible that they feel disrespected. The friend didn't communicate the plans properly, which is on them too.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's not worth the effort (plane ticket, hotel, time off) if they're not part of the party. But attending a wedding is usually expected as a close friend, regardless of being in the party. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not attending. However, if the friendship has been drifting, maybe it's a valid decision to not attend and move on. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nOn one hand, not attending without talking it out could be seen as cutting off the friend without addressing the issue. On the other hand, if the friend didn't communicate well, the author is justified in feeling hurt. The key points are communication and social expectations. The author didn't reach out to the friend to express their hurt feelings but instead decided to not attend and cut contact. Maybe they should have talked first. But if the friendship is already drifting, maybe it's a valid choice. \n\nSo, considering all that, I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because attending a wedding is a social norm even if you're not in the party. Not attending without discussing it might be seen as abandoning the friend. But it's also understandable if the author feels the friendship is one-sided. However, the answer might depend on cultural expectations and the specific circumstances. But based on the information given, the author's decision to not attend seems hasty and possibly inconsiderate of the social norms around weddings.\n"
