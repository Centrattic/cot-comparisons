I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend her friend's wedding because she wasn't asked to be a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, the friend didn't tell her about the wedding in person, which the author found hurtful. They were friends for 15 years, and the author assumed she'd be the maid of honor since the friend was her maid of honor in her own wedding. But the friend chose someone else. The author was hurt but understood they had drifted apart. Then, when the author checked Facebook again, she realized she wasn't even a bridesmaid. \n\nNow, the author is considering not attending the wedding because she's not in the wedding party. She mentions that attending would involve some costs and time off work, but she feels it's not worth it. She also says she's moving on from the friendship and doesn't want a one-sided relationship.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the friend's actions and the author's decision. The friend didn't inform her in person, which might be a point of contention, but maybe the author is overreacting. However, the decision to not attend because she's not in the wedding party is more about her own feelings. \n\nTypically, attending a friend's wedding is expected regardless of being in the party, but it's not a strict rule. The author is prioritizing her own feelings and resources. If the friend had hurt her by excluding her, maybe the author is justified in her reaction. However, some might argue that weddings are important for friends even if you're not in the party. \n\nThe author is not being mean; she's hurt and choosing to focus on other relationships. But some might say she's cutting off the friend too quickly. However, considering the friend's actions (not informing her first, not including her in the party), the author's response might be understandable. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's allowed to prioritize her feelings, especially after feeling slighted. It's a personal choice, and she's not obligated to attend. The friend's actions might have been inconsiderate, so the author's response is reasonable.\n"
