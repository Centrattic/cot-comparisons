I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend's wedding where the author wasn't asked to be a bridesmaid, even though they were close for 15 years. The author is considering not attending because they weren't in the wedding party and feels hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author thought they would be the maid of honor since their friend was the maid of honor in their own wedding two years ago. But the friend chose someone else. The author found out through Facebook posts, which might have been a point of hurt. They're now considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party, even though it's a few states away and requires some effort.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't want a one-sided friendship anymore and don't want to attend if they're not part of the wedding party. On the other hand, some might argue that attending a friend's wedding is a customary gesture, regardless of being in the wedding party. The friend might expect them to come, especially since they were close. The author could be seen as cutting off contact entirely, which might be harsh.\n\nBut considering the emotional aspect, the author is hurt and feels unappreciated. They've drifted apart, and the friend chose others. The author is making a personal choice based on their feelings. Weddings are the bride's choice, so the author's exclusion isn't necessarily a betrayal. Deciding not to attend because they're not part of the wedding party might be their way of setting a boundary. However, some people might argue that attending is a sign of support regardless. \n\nIn many cultures, attending a friend's wedding is expected even if you're not in the party. But the author is prioritizing their own feelings and future friendships. The key here is whether the author's decision is justified. If the friendship has already been drifting, maybe the author is justified in not wanting to attend. The friend didn't ask them, and the author is choosing to move on. However, others might say that attending would show support despite being left out. \n\nI think the answer hinges on societal norms versus personal feelings. If the author is not in the wedding party, they aren't obligated to attend. But some might see it as a breach of friendship. However, the author is making a conscious choice about their relationships. They might not be in the wrong because it's their right to prioritize their own feelings. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to be careful. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to weigh both perspectives.\n"
