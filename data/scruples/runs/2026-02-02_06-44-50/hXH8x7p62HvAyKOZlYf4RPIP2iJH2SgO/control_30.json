I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend who didn't invite them to the wedding party and now they're considering not attending the wedding altogether. \n\nFirst, the user is a 15-year friend, and they were surprised to find out about the wedding on Facebook. They had expected to be the maid of honor since their friend was the maid of honor at their wedding two years ago. But instead, the friend chose another childhood best friend, and then other people who aren't as close. The user feels hurt but understands the friend's choice. Now, the user is thinking about skipping the wedding because they weren't in the wedding party.\n\nSo the key points here: The user's main reason for not attending is because they were excluded from the wedding party. They mention it's not a major hardship financially but they feel it's not worth it. They also say they don't want a one-sided friendship anymore and plan to cut contact.\n\nI need to assess if the user is in the wrong. Weddings are the host's choice, and they can invite whoever they want. The user is upset about not being in the wedding party, which is understandable, but attending the wedding is still a separate matter. Typically, even if you're not in the wedding party, attending is considered polite unless there are major issues. However, the user is using their exclusion as a reason not to attend. \n\nBut there's another angle: the user was close friends and expected to be in the party. The friend didn't inform them first, which is a slight. However, the user is choosing not to attend, which might be seen as cutting off the friendship over an invitation. \n\nSocial norms suggest that attending a friend's wedding is expected, regardless of being in the party. So if the user is not attending because they were excluded, some might say that's being in the wrong. But others might argue that the friend's actions (not informing them first, excluding them) justify the user's decision. \n\nAlso, the user mentions they plan to cut contact after this, which might indicate they feel the friendship is already over. If that's the case, not attending might be their way of ending the relationship. But does that make them right or wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios, the community often looks for consideration towards the other person's feelings. If the user's decision to not attend is spiteful, that could be the wrong. But if it's a self-respecting choice because they don't want to be in a one-sided friendship, maybe not. \n\nI think the answer might hinge on whether not attending is a reasonable response. Since the user is not in the wedding party, attending is optional. But culturally, it's expected. However, the user's reasoning is based on their own feelings of being slighted. So there's a balance here. \n\nI'm leaning towards the user not being in the wrong because they have legitimate hurt feelings and are making a choice based on their comfort, not malice. Also, the friend didn't include them in initial communications, which is a problem. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
