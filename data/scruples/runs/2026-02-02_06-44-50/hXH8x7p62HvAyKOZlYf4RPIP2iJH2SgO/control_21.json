I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't chosen as a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The friend has known her for 15 years, but she was surprised when the friend found out about the engagement on Facebook. The author thought they'd be the maid of honor since the friend was at their wedding. But the friend chose someone else. The author feels hurt and even more so when they see others in the wedding party who aren't close. Now, the author is considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party.\n\nSo, the main question is whether not attending the wedding is justified. The author mentions that attending would involve some expenses and time off, but it's not a major hardship. However, they feel it's not worth it because they're already hurt and don't want a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nI need to think about social norms here. Traditionally, close friends attend each other's weddings regardless of being in the wedding party. But the author is hurt and feels the friendship has drifted. They might feel that the friend isn't valuing the relationship as much. However, even if the friendship has drifted, attending a wedding is a common courtesy, especially for a long-term friend. Not attending because you're not in the wedding party could be seen as cutting off contact, which might be harsh. On the other hand, the author's feelings are valid; if the friend didn't include them in the wedding party, maybe they feel unappreciated. But the author is also choosing not to attend, which could be hurtful to the friend. There's a balance between personal feelings and maintaining the friendship, even if it's changing.\n\nThe author says they don't plan to stay in contact after this, which adds another layer. Ending the friendship might be their way of dealing with the hurt, but that could be extreme. However, if the friendship has already drifted, maybe it's a natural progression. Still, attending the wedding could be a final gesture of respect. \n\nSocially, it's often expected to attend a close friend's wedding even if you're not part of the party. So, the author might be seen as in the wrong for not attending. But if the friendship is already strained and the author is making a conscious decision to move on, maybe it's understandable. The key is whether the author is overreacting. The friend didn't ask them to be in the wedding party, which is the friend's right, but the author's response is to not attend. That might be seen as taking it too far. So, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because attending is a social expectation, unless there's a valid reason not to. But if the author feels the friendship is one-sided and is moving on, maybe it's B (not in the wrong). Hmm. I need to weigh these factors. The author's hurt is valid, but the action of skipping the wedding might be cutting off the friend unnecessarily. So maybe A. But if the author is done with the friendship, then B. The answer might depend on context not provided. Since the author says they don't want a one-sided friendship and plan to not stay in contact, maybe they're justified in not attending. So B.\n"
