I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding after not being chosen as a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, the friend found out about the wedding through Facebook, which was unexpected. The author thought they would be the maid of honor since the friend was their maid of honor at their own wedding. But the friend chose someone else. The author feels hurt but understands the drift. Now, they're considering skipping the wedding because they're not in the wedding party.\n\nSo, the key points here: is it wrong to not attend the wedding because you're not in the wedding party? Let's think about social norms. Typically, attending a friend's wedding is seen as important, especially if you've known them for 15 years. The author is making a choice based on their feelings about not being included in the wedding party. But is that a valid reason?\n\nI should consider the emotional aspect. The author is hurt, which is understandable. However, attending a wedding is usually about celebrating the couple, not about one's own status. Even if you're not in the wedding party, many people still attend to support their friends. The author is planning to distance themselves after this, which adds another layer. \n\nBut maybe the issue is whether the author is overreacting. They mention it's not a major hardship, so the financial aspect isn't the main issue. The emotional hurt is. However, weddings can be expensive, and sometimes people do use that as an excuse. But the author seems genuine in their feelings.\n\nAnother angle: the friend might not have told them first. The author was surprised by the Facebook post. That could have been an oversight or a mistake on the friend's part. The author might feel slighted, but maybe the friend didn't realize how important it was to them. \n\nIs it the author's fault for expecting to be in the wedding party? They thought they would be the maid of honor, but the friend chose someone else. That's a personal decision, and the author might have misread the situation. But expecting to be in the wedding party based on a past role might be reasonable. \n\nIn terms of friendship, if the author is already distancing themselves, maybe they're holding a grudge. But if the friendship has been drifting, maybe that's mutual. \n\nSocially, is it wrong not to attend? Some might say yes, because you should support your friend regardless of the wedding party role. Others might say it's okay to prioritize your feelings. The author's reasoning is that they don't want a one-sided friendship. But by not attending, they might be cutting off a long-term friend. \n\nI think the key is whether the author is overreacting. If they're making a big deal out of not being in the wedding party and using that as an excuse to not attend, then maybe they're in the wrong. But if their feelings are genuine and they feel disrespected, some might side with them. \n\nBut generally, attending a friend's wedding is expected, even if you're not in the wedding party. The author is choosing to skip it because of their hurt feelings, which could be seen as selfish. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
