I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and the friend have been close for 15 years. The friend was the maid of honor at the author's wedding, so the author expected to be the maid of honor for the friend. But the friend chose someone else, and now the author isn't in the wedding party at all. The author feels hurt and is considering not attending, even though it's a few states away and requires some effort. They also mention they don't want a one-sided friendship anymore and plan to cut off contact.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, weddings are significant events, and not attending might be seen as cutting someone off. The friend might expect some level of attendance, especially given their long friendship. The author's decision not to attend could come off as petty or vindictive, even if they're hurt. Also, the author is using the wedding as a reason to end contact, which could be harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, the author felt slighted because they weren't included in the wedding party. They had a history where they were the maid of honor, so it's understandable to feel hurt. The author is also considering the effort and cost, which are valid factors. They might feel that attending without being in the wedding party is awkward or not worth it. The author's reasoning about not wanting a one-sided friendship is also a point\u2014maybe they feel the friendship has drifted, and this is the final straw.\n\nBut wait, cutting off contact entirely because of not being in the wedding party might be extreme. Even if the author isn't in the wedding party, attending could still maintain some relationship. However, if the author feels the friendship is already drifting and they don't want to invest more time or money, maybe their decision is self-preservation.\n\nThe AITA format usually looks for whether the action is inconsiderate or wrong. While the author's feelings are valid, deciding not to attend a close friend's wedding because you weren't in the wedding party might be seen as inconsiderate. The friend might not have control over the author's feelings, and the author's response could hurt the friend more than expected.\n\nAlso, the author was surprised to find out about the wedding on Facebook, which added to the hurt. That initial snub might have contributed to the decision. But the main issue is the wedding attendance. Not attending could be seen as a major slight, especially if the author isn't giving the friend the chance to explain or reconcile.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's feelings are understandable, choosing to not attend a close friend's wedding over not being in the wedding party might be inconsiderate and petty. The effort required isn't that significant compared to the potential damage to the friendship. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
