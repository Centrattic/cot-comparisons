I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding since they're not a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, the author has been friends with this person for over 15 years. The friend kept the author in the dark about the wedding, only finding out on Facebook. The author expected to be the maid of honor since the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. But the friend chose someone else, maybe a childhood friend. The author is hurt because they feel their friendship has drifted, but they still assumed they'd be a bridesmaid. Now, they're considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party and don't want to attend a one-sided event. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, what's the norm here? Typically, attending a close friend's wedding is expected, regardless of being in the wedding party. But the author feels slighted. They might be upset because the friend didn't reach out sooner, didn't include them in the wedding party, and maybe they feel the friendship has become one-sided. \n\nBut is it wrong to not attend? Well, weddings are about celebrating the couple, not just the wedding party. Even if you're not in the party, attending is usually expected for close friends. The author is using the fact they're not in the party as a reason not to go. However, their hurt feelings might be valid. The friend didn't communicate well, leading to the author finding out via Facebook, which is a red flag. Also, not attending could be seen as cutting off contact entirely, which might be harsh if they still want to stay friends. But the author says they don't plan to stay in contact after this. \n\nSo, the author's reasoning is based on hurt feelings and a sense of being undervalued. But by not attending, they're making it about their own feelings rather than the friend's actions. However, it's also their right to decide how to spend their time and money. The friend might have misjudged the current closeness. The author's decision to not attend might be a reaction to feeling unappreciated, but maybe they should attend regardless for the friend's sake. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author is not in the wedding party, the friend might not expect them to attend, though that's a bit harsh. The key point is that attending a close friend's wedding is usually expected, even if you're not in the party. So the author is in the wrong for not attending. But if the friend's behavior was inconsiderate (not telling them first, not including them), maybe the author has a valid reason. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A, then yes, they are wrong to not attend. If B, then no. Considering the norm, attending is expected. However, the friend's actions were inconsiderate. The author's decision is based on their feelings, but not attending might be seen as cutting off the friend. But the author says they don't plan to stay in contact anyway. \n\nHmm. So, if the author is choosing not to attend because they're not in the wedding party, that's more about their own feelings rather than the friend's actions. It's understandable to feel hurt, but attending the wedding is still a sign of respect and support. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
