I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't chosen as a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, the author and the friend have known each other for over 15 years. The author was surprised when they found out about the wedding on Facebook, which might have been a point of hurt. They assumed they would be the maid of honor since their friend was the maid of honor in their own wedding two years ago. But the friend chose someone else, and then even more people who aren't as close now. \n\nThe author is hurt but acknowledges it's the friend's day. However, they're considering not attending because they're not in the wedding party. They mention the cost and inconvenience of traveling, but it's not a major hardship. The author also says they don't want a one-sided friendship and don't plan to stay in contact after.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, attending a friend's wedding is a social expectation, especially for a long-time friend. It's a significant event, and not attending could be seen as cutting the friend off completely, even if they're not in the wedding party. It might come off as petty or unforgiving.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels hurt and undervalued. They might feel that their friend didn't consider them close enough to include in the wedding party, which is a big snub. The author is also making a point about the friendship being one-sided and not wanting to continue it. If they're already planning to distance themselves, maybe attending isn't necessary.\n\nBut here's the thing: even if the author is hurt, attending the wedding could be a way to show support despite the hurt. It's a chance to be there for the friend's big day, even if they're not in the bridal party. Not attending might be seen as withdrawing completely, which could be hurtful to the friend. The author's reasoning is based on feeling unappreciated, but sometimes people's priorities change, and not being in the wedding party doesn't necessarily mean the friend doesn't value the friendship overall.\n\nAlso, the author's decision to not attend might be more about their own feelings of rejection than the friendship being one-sided. Maybe they need to attend to maintain their own closure or to avoid burning bridges. However, if the author truly plans to move on from the friendship, maybe attending is not necessary. But typically, attending a wedding is a nice gesture even if you're not in the party.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, if they choose not to attend, it could be seen as selfish, especially since it's a major event for their friend. However, if they feel the friendship is one-sided and are moving on, maybe it's not entirely wrong. But the key here is the reason for not attending. If it's because they're not in the bridal party, that's a bit petty. If it's because they're cutting ties, then maybe it's justified.\n\nI think the answer here is that the author is in the wrong (A) because attending the wedding is a kind gesture, even if they're not part of the bridal party. Not attending for that reason might be seen as being petty and not supporting a long-time friend. The author might need to attend to show support and then move on with their friendship decisions after the event.\n"
