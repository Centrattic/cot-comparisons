I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend's wedding and whether the author should attend since they weren't asked to be in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, the author and the friend have been friends for 15 years. The friend was the maid of honor at the author's wedding, so the author assumed they'd be the maid of honor in return. But the friend chose someone else, another childhood friend. The author feels hurt but understands they've drifted apart. Then, when the author sees the wedding party list, they realize they weren't even asked to be a bridesmaid. \n\nThe author is considering not attending the wedding because they were excluded from the wedding party. They mention that it's not a major hardship but they don't want to go because they feel embarrassed and don't want a one-sided friendship anymore. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending.\n\nSo, the key points here are about friendship expectations and attending a wedding. Weddings are significant events, and while it's the bride's choice who to include in the wedding party, attending as a guest is usually expected unless there are valid reasons not to. The author's reasoning is that since they aren't in the wedding party, they don't see the point in attending. But is that a valid reason?\n\nThe author's feelings are hurt, which is understandable. However, choosing to not attend because they weren't in the wedding party might be seen as a way to take revenge or express disappointment. Weddings are about celebrating the couple, not about the guest list. Friends might expect you to attend even if you're not in the party, especially after being friends for 15 years. The author mentions they don't want a one-sided friendship, but cutting off contact entirely might be harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend did exclude them from the wedding party, which is a big snub. The author could feel slighted, and maybe not attending is their way of coping with the hurt. But is it wrong to prioritize their feelings over attending a wedding? It's a tough call. \n\nIn terms of social norms, attending a friend's wedding is expected unless there's a conflict or personal reason. If the author is choosing not to go to make a point about being excluded, that could be seen as inconsiderate, as the wedding is about the couple, not the guests. However, the author has the right to their feelings and their time. It's possible they're not in the wrong, because attending a wedding that's far and requires effort might be a choice they make based on their current relationship status. \n\nBut maybe the author is overreacting. The friend didn't ask them to be in the party, which is a choice the bride makes. The author's response is to not attend, which might be taking it too far. The fact that they were already drifting apart suggests the friendship might be changing, but not attending a wedding could be seen as cutting off completely, which might be harsh. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because they're choosing not to attend out of hurt feelings, which is taking it to an extreme. The friend might expect them to come regardless. The answer would be A.\n"
