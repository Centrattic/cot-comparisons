I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and the friend have been friends for 15 years. The friend didn't tell them about the wedding first, which the author found hurtful. They assumed they'd be the maid of honor since the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding two years ago. But the friend chose another childhood friend as the maid of honor. The author still thought they'd be a bridesmaid, but upon checking social media, realized they're not in the wedding party at all. Now, they're considering not attending the wedding because of this, even though it's not convenient and they don't plan to stay in contact afterward.\n\nThe key points here are the author's feelings of being hurt and the decision to not attend. The author is feeling slighted and is using that as a reason to skip the wedding. But is that justified?\n\nWeddings are typically for the couple to celebrate with their loved ones. The author isn't in the wedding party, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't attend. Friends and family attend regardless of being part of the party. The author might feel it's a one-sided friendship now, but maybe they can still attend for the sake of the friendship's history. However, the author is also considering not staying in contact after, which suggests they're reevaluating the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have drifted, and maybe the author is right to focus on more reciprocal relationships. But not attending because they weren't in the wedding party could be seen as holding a grudge. Weddings are expensive and logistically challenging, so maybe the author is making a point about feeling unappreciated. \n\nThe question is whether it's wrong to not attend. If the author feels that attending would only cause them emotional distress and they're moving on from the friendship, maybe it's not wrong. But if they're using the wedding as a way to punish the friend for not including them in the party, then it might be wrong. \n\nI think the answer depends on intent. If they're not attending because they don't feel valued anymore and are cutting ties, that's one thing. But if they're punishing the friend for a social slight, that's another. The author mentions they're not interested in a one-sided friendship, so maybe it's the former. However, the act of skipping a significant event because they weren't in the party could be seen as holding a grudge. \n\nI'm a bit torn here. If the author is choosing to end the friendship and not attend, that's their choice. But if they're attending just for the sake of attending, maybe they should. But the author isn't in the wedding party and feels hurt. In that case, attending might be awkward. \n\nHmm. The answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they have the right to choose their social engagements and prioritize their well-being, especially if they feel the friendship is one-sided. However, some might argue A (they are in the wrong) because weddings are about celebrating the couple, not about being in the party. \n\nBut given the author's reasoning, they're not attending because they feel unappreciated and are ending the friendship. So maybe they're not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
