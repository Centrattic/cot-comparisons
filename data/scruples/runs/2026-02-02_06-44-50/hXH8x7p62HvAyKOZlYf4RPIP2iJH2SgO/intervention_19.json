I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. Hmm. The author was friends with the bride for 15 years and was the maid of honor at her wedding. But now, the bride chose someone else as her maid of honor. The author feels hurt and drifted apart. They're not in the wedding party and considering not attending.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the social norms here. Typically, even if you're not in the wedding party, attending a friend's wedding is expected, especially if you're a close friend. Weddings are big events, and friends are usually invited. The author is not in the wedding party, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't attend. The bride might not have a huge wedding party, or maybe she's including more people. The author's decision not to attend could be seen as a judgment on the bride's choices.\n\nThe author mentions feeling embarrassed and not wanting to be in a one-sided friendship. But is it really about being one-sided? The bride did invite the author to talk about wedding plans initially, so she did reach out. The author was hurt when finding out about the maid of honor. But maybe the bride thought about including the author but decided otherwise. \n\nThe author is planning not to attend because they're not in the wedding party, which could be seen as holding a grudge. Attending a wedding is a kind gesture, even if you're not part of the party. The author might be punishing the bride by not showing up, which could harm their friendship. The author says they don't plan to stay in contact after, which adds to the idea of cutting off a long-term friendship over this.\n\nBut then, the author is also considering the cost and time. But if the friendship was important, they might still attend despite the expense. However, the author feels it's not worth it. But is that a valid reason? The core issue is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending because they're not in the wedding party. \n\nIn many cultures, weddings are about celebrating the couple's union, not about being in the party. So even if you're not a bridesmaid, attending is expected unless there's a valid reason. The author's reason here is not a valid reason but rather a personal hurt. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not attending. \n\nBut then again, the author might feel that they've been slighted, especially since they were the maid of honor in the bride's wedding. The bride's choice to not include the author in her wedding party could have hurt feelings. However, the author's response is to not attend, which might be overly harsh. \n\nI think the key points are: 1) The author is not attending because they're not in the wedding party. 2) The bride did invite them initially and had a close relationship. 3) The author is choosing to cut off the friendship. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because attending a friend's wedding is a social expectation, and not attending out of hurt feelings might be seen as selfish. Alternatively, if the author feels the friendship is one-sided, maybe it's not their fault. But cutting off a 15-year friendship over this might be extreme. Hmm. Need to decide between A and B.\n"
