I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend getting married, and the author not being asked to be in the wedding party, leading them to consider not attending the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was a close friend for over 15 years. They were surprised when they found out about the wedding via Facebook, which they thought should have been shared first. They assumed they'd be the maid of honor because their friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. However, the friend chose another childhood friend as the maid of honor, and other people in the wedding party who aren't as close. The author feels hurt, understands drifting apart, but now is considering not attending the wedding since they aren't in the wedding party. They're asking if they're the AITA (am I the asshole).\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nSo, considering societal norms and friendship expectations. Is it wrong to not attend a friend's wedding because you're not in the wedding party? On one hand, weddings are important events, and attending is a sign of support regardless of being in the wedding party. On the other hand, if the friendship has drifted, maybe the author's feelings are justified.\n\nThe friend didn't inform the author first, which could be a point against them. The author felt slighted by not being a bridesmaid, which is a significant role. But attending the wedding is a separate issue. Even if not in the wedding party, attending is considered polite unless there's a good reason not to.\n\nThe author mentions not wanting to attend because of embarrassment and feeling like a one-sided friendship. But cutting off contact entirely might be a different matter. However, the question is about attending the wedding. The author is considering not attending because they weren't included in the wedding party, which could be seen as prioritizing their own feelings over supporting their friend, even if the friendship has changed.\n\nIn many cultures, attending a close friend's wedding is expected, regardless of being in the party. Not attending might be seen as disrespectful, regardless of the reason. The author's reasoning is based on personal hurt feelings, but that might not be a valid reason to skip the event. So, the author might be in the wrong for not attending because it's a significant event for their friend.\n\nAdditionally, the author acknowledges that the friend has a right to choose her wedding party. So, even if hurt, attending is a way to show support. Choosing not to attend because of not being in the party could be seen as selfish. Therefore, the answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
