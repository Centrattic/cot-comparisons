I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-time friend not being invited as a bridesmaid in her friend's wedding. The author found out through Facebook, which was a surprise. They were a maid of honor in the friend's wedding two years ago but now the role went to another childhood friend. The author is considering not attending the wedding because they're hurt and not in the wedding party. They think it's a one-sided friendship now and don't plan to stay in contact.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics. The friend didn't tell the author first, which is a red flag. The author was expecting to be a bridesmaid, given their past role. The fact that the friend chose other people, some not close, might indicate a shift in the friendship. The author feels hurt and is questioning their own decision to attend. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for not attending? Well, attending a friend's wedding is a personal choice, not an obligation. Even though they're not in the wedding party, attending is a kind gesture. But the author is hurt and feels slighted. They also mention the cost and time involved, which aren't insignificant. However, the core issue is the friendship dynamics. If the friend didn't include them in the wedding party, maybe there's a drift. The author wants to focus on friends who value their presence. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, not attending might be seen as a bit harsh, especially since it's a major life event. But the author isn't obligated to go. The friend's actions (not telling first, not including in the wedding party) could justify the author's feelings. However, the author is choosing not to attend as a form of retaliation, which could be seen as holding a grudge. But given the friend's behavior, maybe the author is justified.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't wrong if they feel it's not worth attending after being excluded. However, some might argue that attending is the mature choice to maintain respect. But the author's decision to cut ties post-wedding complicates things. If they're already moving on, maybe not attending is their way of closing that chapter. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer isn't straightforward. But the user asked for A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No). The author is hurt and making a choice based on their feelings. While attending could be seen as better, it's their right to choose. So the answer is probably B, not in the wrong.\n"
