I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't made a bridesmaid. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 15-year friend of the bride. They were surprised when they found out about the wedding on Facebook, which might be a red flag. Then they thought they'd be the maid of honor because the friend was in that role at their wedding two years ago. But the bride chose another childhood friend as maid of honor, and the author wasn't in the wedding party at all. Now they're considering not attending because they're hurt and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations and the actual actions. The author had an assumption based on reciprocity (they were the maid of honor at the friend's wedding), but the bride made a different choice. The author feels slighted and is using not attending the wedding as a form of punishment. \n\nIs it the author's fault? Well, weddings are personal, and the bride has the right to choose her wedding party. The author's initial hurt is understandable, but not attending might be a harsh reaction. They're using the wedding attendance as leverage in the friendship. Also, they mention not staying in contact after, which suggests they're cutting off the friendship over this. \n\nBut the author isn't obligated to attend. However, the way they're framing it as a punishment might be wrong. The bride didn't invite them to the wedding party, which is her right, but the author is now deciding not to attend, which could be seen as holding a grudge. But is it wrong? Maybe. The author is prioritizing their feelings, but the bride might not have intended to hurt them. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was hurt that they found out via Facebook, which is inconsiderate. So maybe the bride did some things wrong too. But the question is about the author's decision. If the author is choosing to not attend a friend's wedding because they weren't in the wedding party, that's their choice, but they might be in the wrong for being petty. \n\nSo the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they're letting the hurt feelings lead them to ignore the friendship. But others might argue B (not in the wrong) because they're respecting their own feelings. It's a bit nuanced. The user initially thought A, but maybe the answer is A because they're not attending out of spite.\n"
