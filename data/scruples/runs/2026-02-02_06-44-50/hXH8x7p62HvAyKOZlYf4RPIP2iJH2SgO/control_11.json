I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding after not being asked to be a bridesmaid. They've been friends for 15 years, and the friend didn't tell them about the wedding until Facebook. The friend was the maid of honor at their wedding, but now she's chosen someone else. The person feels hurt but understands the drift. Now, they're considering not attending because they're not in the wedding party and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship.\n\nFirst, the user's main point is about attending the wedding. They're questioning if it's wrong to skip it. Weddings are usually for close friends and family. If you're not in the wedding party, attending is optional. The friend didn't include them in the wedding party, which is the friend's choice. The user is hurt, but they're also making a choice here. They don't want to spend money or time on a trip if they're not in the bridal party. \n\nThey mention not staying in contact after this. That might be a factor. But the question is about attending the wedding, not the future friendship. If the user isn't in the wedding party, they could argue that they're not obligated to attend. However, some might say that a 15-year friendship should still attend the wedding regardless. But others might say it's the friend's day and she chose her attendants. \n\nThe user isn't being malicious; they're hurt and feeling unappreciated. They're making a choice based on their own feelings and circumstances. The answer would depend on cultural norms, but generally, attending a wedding isn't mandatory unless you're in the party. So the user isn't in the wrong for choosing not to attend but maybe should consider the relationship's value. Since they plan to stop contact, maybe they're using the wedding as an excuse. But the question is about attending, not the future contact. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), they aren't in the wrong. They're managing their feelings and priorities.\n"
