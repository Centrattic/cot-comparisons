I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. \n\nFirst, the friend found out about the wedding through Facebook instead of being told directly. That's a red flag. The author was the maid of honor at the friend's wedding two years ago, so expecting reciprocity makes sense. When the friend chose another person for the maid of honor, the author was hurt but still thought they'd be a bridesmaid. Then they realized they weren't in the wedding party at all.\n\nThe author's main argument is that since they're not in the wedding party, attending would be a burden without much personal benefit. They also mention wanting to focus on more mutual friendships. \n\nNow, considering social norms, attending a friend's wedding is typically expected, regardless of being in the party. Weddings are about celebrating the couple's union, not just about being part of the party. The author's decision not to go might come off as petty or holding a grudge. Even if the friend didn't ask them to be in the wedding party, that doesn't negate the importance of the event as a guest. The author's reasoning that it's a one-sided friendship is a bit harsh; friends can drift apart, but that doesn't mean they should cut ties. \n\nAlso, the fact that the friend didn't inform the author first is a point. The author might feel slighted, but the appropriate response would be to express hurt feelings and still attend the wedding as a gesture of goodwill. Not attending could be seen as taking a childish stance. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the wedding is the couple's day, and the author's absence might be hurtful to the friend. The author is choosing to prioritize their own feelings over the friendship, which could be seen as the wrong decision. So, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
