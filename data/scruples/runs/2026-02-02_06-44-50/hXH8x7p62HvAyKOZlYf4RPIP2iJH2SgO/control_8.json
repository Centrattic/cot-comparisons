I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether it's acceptable for her not to attend her friend's wedding because she wasn't asked to be in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, the background: They've been friends for 15 years. The friend was the maid of honor at the author's wedding two years ago. The author found out about the wedding through Facebook, which was surprising. She assumed she would be the maid of honor, but the friend chose another childhood friend instead. The author then found out that even the other girls in the wedding party aren't close anymore. The author is hurt but understands it's the friend's choice. However, she's considering not attending because she's not part of the wedding party, and she's also planning to cut off contact after this.\n\nThe key points here are about expectations and the nature of the friendship. The author feels it's a one-sided friendship now since her friend hasn't included her in the important event. But is that a valid reason to skip the wedding?\n\nWell, weddings are significant life events. Even if someone isn't in the wedding party, attending is often seen as a gesture of support and respect. The fact that the author and the friend have drifted apart might explain why she wasn't chosen for the wedding party. However, the author is using the exclusion as a reason not to attend, which could come off as holding a grudge. \n\nBut then there's the aspect of emotional labor and personal choice. The author is hurt and feels undervalued. She's also making a decision based on her own feelings, which is valid. If attending makes her uncomfortable and the friendship is already strained, she might be prioritizing her own well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, not attending could be seen as cutting ties abruptly, especially if the friend didn't realize the depth of the author's feelings. The author might be overreacting by equating exclusion from the wedding party with being unwanted in the friendship entirely. \n\nBut considering that the author mentions she's already planning to stop contact, maybe this is her way of ending the friendship gracefully. If the friendship is one-sided and the author feels disrespected, she's within her rights to set boundaries. \n\nThe moral here might hinge on whether attending the wedding is expected regardless of the circumstances. In many cultures, attending a close friend's wedding is expected even if you're not in the party. However, the author is making a choice based on her own emotional needs. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? She's not obligated to attend someone else's wedding if it's not convenient or if she feels hurt. The decision might be hurtful to the friend, but the author is prioritizing her own feelings, which is her right. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
