I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who didn't invite them to her wedding, and the author is considering not attending because they're not part of the wedding party. The key points are the friendship's history, the author's expectations, and their decision not to attend.\n\nFirst, the author was friends for 15 years and expected to be the maid of honor since their friend was the maid of honor in their wedding. However, the friend chose someone else. The author feels hurt but acknowledges drifting apart. They're not in the wedding party and are questioning if it's okay to skip the wedding due to the emotional hurt.\n\nI need to consider social norms here. Typically, attending a friend's wedding is seen as important regardless of being in the wedding party. Even if you're not part of the party, being there is a sign of support. The author is using the lack of invitation to the wedding party as a reason to not attend, which might be seen as holding a grudge. But they also mention not wanting a one-sided friendship and planning to cut contact, which adds context.\n\nPossible angles: Is it reasonable to attend just because it's a friend's wedding? The cost and effort mentioned are factors, but maybe the author is overemphasizing the hurt feelings. On the other hand, the friend didn't communicate well, surprising the author via Facebook, which is poor etiquette. The friend's actions might have been inconsiderate, so the author's reaction is understandable.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author is justified in their feelings and if skipping the wedding is a valid response. If the author's main issue is not being in the wedding party, but attending the wedding itself isn't required unless you're part of the party, then maybe not in the wrong. However, social expectations often lean towards attending for the friend's sake despite personal hurt. But given the friend's poor communication and the drifting apart, the author's decision might be justified. So, probably answer B (not in the wrong).\n"
