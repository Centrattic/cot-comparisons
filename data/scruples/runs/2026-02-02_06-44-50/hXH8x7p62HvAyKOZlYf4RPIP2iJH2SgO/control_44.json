I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The writer is a friend of over 15 years. They found out about the wedding via Facebook, which they thought was odd since they expected to be told first. They assumed they would be the maid of honor since their friend was their maid of honor in their own wedding two years ago. But the friend chose another childhood best friend as the maid of honor. The writer then realized they weren't in the wedding party at all, and now they're considering not attending the wedding because they're hurt and feel it's a one-sided friendship.\n\nSo the question is whether it's reasonable for them to not attend because they weren't asked to be in the wedding party. Let me break down the factors here.\n\nFirst, the writer's feelings are hurt. They expected to be in the wedding party, especially since they reciprocated by having their friend be their maid of honor. The friend's decision to choose someone else might have been due to drifting apart, as they mention. However, not being in the wedding party is a decision the bride makes, and it's her right to choose who she wants.\n\nNow, the writer is considering not attending because they're hurt. The cost and time involved aren't trivial, but they say it's not a major hardship. The key issue here is whether attending a friend's wedding is a social obligation, regardless of one's role in the ceremony. Generally, attending a close friend's wedding is seen as important, even if you're not part of the wedding party. Weddings are significant events, and many people would attend for their close friends despite not being in the party.\n\nBut the writer is hurt and feels that the friendship is one-sided now. They mention not wanting to stay in contact after. If the friendship has already deteriorated, maybe their decision isn't entirely about the wedding. The writer might be using the wedding as a way to cut ties, which could be justified if they feel the friendship is no longer mutual.\n\nHowever, the main question is about attending the wedding. Even if they're not in the party, is it wrong to skip the event? In many cultures, attending a close friend's wedding is expected, regardless of your role. Not attending could be seen as hurtful, especially if the friend didn't realize the impact of excluding them from the party. The writer might be overreacting to not being in the party, but the friend might have been unaware of how much it would hurt the writer.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer did confront their friend after finding out about the maid of honor, which shows they communicated. The friend didn't ask them, which could be a mistake or oversight, not a malicious act. The writer's decision to not attend could be seen as a reaction to feeling slighted, but it's their choice. They might feel it's not worth the emotional toll, but is that wrong?\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intentions and social norms. If the writer's intention is to avoid a painful situation and they're not attending to spitefully hurt the friend, but rather to protect their own feelings, it's more of a \"No\" (B). However, if they're being petty or ignoring the bigger picture (the wedding is a once-in-a-lifetime event for the friend), they might be in the wrong (A).\n\nThe writer mentions they don't plan to stay in contact after, which suggests this is about ending the friendship. Not attending the wedding in that case could be part of that decision. If the friendship is already ending, maybe not attending is a way to finalize that. But if the friend didn't realize the writer's expectations, the writer could have clarified earlier. \n\nIn summary, while the writer is hurt, the decision to skip the wedding because they're not in the party might be seen as wrong if it's about holding a grudge over something the friend might not have intended to exclude them. However, if the friendship is already deteriorating and the writer is choosing to cut ties, it's more of a personal decision that's not necessarily in the wrong. The key is whether the writer's actions are inconsiderate or justified given the circumstances.\n"
