I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a friend's wedding. The person is a friend of over 15 years, and they were hurt because they weren't told about the wedding first and weren't asked to be in the wedding party. Now they're considering not attending because they aren't a bridesmaid, even though they understand it's the bride's choice.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the expectations. The author assumed they'd be the maid of honor since they were the maid of honor in the friend's wedding two years ago. But the friend chose someone else. The author is hurt, which is natural. But then they're considering not attending because they weren't in the wedding party. \n\nIs it wrong to not attend? Well, a wedding is a big event, and the bride can choose her party based on what's important to her. The author is close to the bride, but maybe their relationship has drifted. Even if they're hurt, attending the wedding could be a way to show support, regardless of the wedding party role. \n\nHowever, the author is also reflecting that they don't want a one-sided friendship and might not stay in contact. That's a personal choice, but the act of attending the wedding could be a way to maintain the friendship, even if they don't end up staying close. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is not obligated to attend. Weddings can be expensive and time-consuming, and if they feel their friend doesn't value their presence, it's understandable they might not want to go. But is it wrong to prioritize their feelings over attending? Maybe not. But the question is about being in the wrong, which suggests a moral or social wrong.\n\nIn terms of social expectations, people might be upset if you don't attend a close friend's wedding without a good reason. However, the author's reason is feeling excluded. If the bride made a choice that the author feels is a slight, that's a personal issue. The author's decision not to attend might be seen as a reaction to being hurt, which isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nBut maybe the expectation is that you attend for the sake of the friendship, even if you're in the wedding party. However, the author is choosing not to go, which could be seen as cutting ties early, which is their right. So it's complicated. The key points are whether attending is a social obligation and if not attending is a betrayal of the friendship. \n\nThe author isn't in the wedding party, so maybe they're not expected to attend, but traditionally, close friends are invited regardless. So the author's decision to not attend could be seen as a choice to disengage, which is their right. Therefore, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But some might argue that attending is expected. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not what others might think. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have the right to prioritize their own feelings and resources, especially if they feel the friendship is becoming one-sided. They're making a personal choice based on their emotional state and expectations.\n"
