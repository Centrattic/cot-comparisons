I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-time friend who wasn't invited to her friend's wedding. \n\nFirst, the friend found out about the wedding on Facebook, which the author found surprising because they expected to be told first. Then, the author assumed they would be the maid of honor since their friend was the maid of honor in their wedding two years ago. But now, the author is not in the wedding party at all. The author is considering not attending because they feel hurt and think it's not worth the effort and cost, especially since they are drifting apart.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending. Let me break this down. \n\nWeddings are big events, and attending usually involves significant time and money. The author's friend didn't include them in the wedding party, which is a big snub. The author feels hurt and embarrassed. They mention that they want to avoid a one-sided friendship and plan to cut ties. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, considering the cost and effort, maybe it's reasonable not to attend if they're not part of the wedding party. But on the other hand, not attending could be seen as cutting off contact completely, which might be harsh. \n\nHowever, the friend didn't even tell the author about the wedding first, which is a red flag. The author was the maid of honor at her wedding, so the friend should have considered them for a similar role. The fact that the author wasn't informed first and then excluded from the wedding party makes the friend at fault here. \n\nThe author's decision not to attend might be a way to set boundaries. Since the friendship is drifting and the friend didn't include them, maybe it's justified. But is it the author's fault for not attending? Well, the author isn't obligated to attend. It's a personal choice, and they have a valid reason to feel hurt and not want to go through the effort if it's not reciprocated. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (Not in the wrong). The friend's actions were hurtful, and the author has every right to not attend if they feel it's not worth it. The author isn't required to attend, especially if they're not part of the wedding party and the friendship is deteriorating. The main issue here is the friend's lack of communication and inclusion, not the author's decision to not attend.\n"
