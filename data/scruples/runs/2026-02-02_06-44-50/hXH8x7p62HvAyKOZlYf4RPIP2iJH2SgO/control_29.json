I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The author is considering not attending a friend's wedding because they weren't chosen as a bridesmaid. They were friends for 15 years, but the friend didn't tell them about the wedding first. The author thought they would be maid of honor since their friend was their maid of honor in their wedding. But the friend chose someone else, and now the author feels hurt and doesn't want to attend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is hurt because they weren't included in the wedding party. The friend didn't inform them first, which is a red flag. Also, the author's friend chose someone else as maid of honor, which the author might feel is a slight. The author is planning not to attend because of this, which could seem harsh, but maybe they feel justified.\n\nThe key points are: the friend didn't communicate the wedding plans first, didn't include them in the wedding party, and the author isn't close anymore. The author is also considering not attending due to the effort and time involved, plus the hurt feelings. They mentioned they don't want a one-sided friendship and plan to cut contact.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, attending a wedding is a social expectation, especially for a close friend. But if the relationship has already deteriorated, maybe not. However, cutting contact entirely might be extreme. The author's reasoning is that they don't want to be in a one-sided friendship, which could be valid if the friend has been distant. The friend's actions (not informing them first, choosing others) might have contributed. \n\nBut the question is about the author's choice to not attend. Even if hurt, attending might still be the socially expected thing. However, if the friendship is already strained and the author feels disrespected, maybe not attending is self-respect. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often get called out for being too harsh. But sometimes the other person is in the wrong. Here, the friend's actions (not informing first, excluding from wedding party) might be the main issue. The author's decision to not attend is a reaction to feeling slighted. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the friend didn't communicate well and changed the dynamics. But some might say you should still attend for a long-time friend regardless. \n\nI think the answer might be B (No), because the friend didn't handle the situation well (didn't communicate, excluded them), and the author has a right to prioritize their feelings. However, there's a social expectation to attend, but if the friendship is already ending, it's more about respecting their own feelings.\n"
