I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for deciding not to attend their friend's wedding after not being asked to be in the wedding party. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around weddings. Traditionally, close friends are expected to attend a wedding, even if they're not part of the bridal party. Weddings are significant events, and attending is a way to show support and celebrate with the couple. But the author is hurt and feels slighted by not being included in the wedding party, which they had assumed they would be.\n\nThe author mentions that their friend didn't tell them first about the wedding, which adds to their feeling of being excluded. They had assumed they would be the maid of honor because the friend was their maid of honor at their wedding. However, the friend chose someone else. The author is now considering not attending because they're hurt and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship. \n\nThe key points here are the value of the long-term friendship, the hurt feelings from not being included, and the decision to attend or not based on that. Social expectations might say that attending is important regardless of being in the bridal party, especially after 15 years. But the author's emotional response is valid; feeling slighted is a personal reaction. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is prioritizing their feelings over maintaining the friendship, which could be seen as a breach of commitment to a long-term friend. Others might argue that the author is justified in feeling hurt and that attending a wedding when not part of the party could be awkward or uncomfortable. \n\nThe author's decision to not stay in contact afterward adds complexity. If they're cutting off the friendship, maybe they feel it's over, but not attending the wedding could be seen as a final act of resentment. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit subjective. But given that weddings are major events where friends are expected to attend regardless of their role in the party, the author might be in the wrong. However, there's also the aspect of feeling disrespected, which complicates things. The answer depends on cultural norms and personal values. But generally, attending is expected unless there's a valid reason, so the author might be in the wrong for not attending.\n"
