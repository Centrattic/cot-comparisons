I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding after not being asked into the wedding party. The author and the friend have been close for 15 years, but the friend found out via Facebook and wasn't in the wedding party. The author is considering not attending the wedding because they're hurt and feel it's a one-sided friendship now.\n\nFirst, the friend not being in the wedding party is a big deal. The author assumed they'd be the maid of honor, given their history, but the friend chose someone else. That's definitely a letdown. But the friend did reach out to the author after finding out on Facebook, and they talked about the wedding plans. The author might have felt left out or unvalued when they weren't included in the wedding party, especially since they were the maid of honor in the friend's wedding two years ago. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending. Attending a wedding typically requires time, money, and effort. If the author is hurt and feels the friendship is one-sided, maybe they're justified in choosing not to attend. But weddings are also about celebrating the couple, and sometimes people go even if they're upset. \n\nHowever, there's a cultural expectation that friends attend each other's weddings, even if they're not in the party. But that expectation might be more about the closeness of the friendship. If the friendship has drifted, maybe the author isn't obligated. Also, the friend didn't reach out to ask the author to attend, which might suggest that absence of inclusion in the wedding party could affect the decision. \n\nThe author is considering not attending as a way to show they don't want a one-sided friendship. That's a valid point. If the friend isn't maintaining the relationship, the author has the right to step back. But maybe the author could at least attend to maintain the friendship, even if it's uncomfortable. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's feelings are legitimate. Being hurt and feeling ignored can affect how someone chooses to spend their time and resources. It's a personal decision. The key factors here are the depth of the friendship, the effort from both sides, and the author's emotional state. \n\nIn some cases, people might see attending the wedding as important regardless of the circumstances, but if the friendship has deteriorated, it's understandable to prioritize one's well-being. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing not to attend. They're making a choice based on their feelings and the current state of the friendship. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to decide not to attend, especially if they feel the friendship isn't mutual anymore. However, it's also worth considering that attending might be a way to show support and move past the hurt. But the decision to not attend isn't inherently wrong if it's based on genuine feelings of being unappreciated.\n"
