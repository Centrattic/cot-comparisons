I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding since they weren't included in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, the author has been friends with the bride for 15 years. They were surprised when they found out about the wedding on Facebook instead of being told directly. This could be a point of hurt, as they might have expected to be informed first, especially since the bride was their maid of honor in their own wedding two years ago.\n\nThe author assumed they would be the maid of honor because of the reciprocal role in the past. But the bride chose another childhood friend for that role. The author then realized they weren't in the wedding party at all. They feel hurt but understand that maybe they've drifted apart. However, the key issue is whether attending the wedding is optional now because they're not part of the party.\n\nThe author is considering not attending because they don't want to be there as just a guest, given the financial and time commitment. They also mention wanting to focus on other friends who value their presence. The dilemma here is whether not attending is justified or if they're overreacting.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, attending a friend's wedding is a common expectation, even if you're not in the party. But the author is feeling slighted and doesn't want to be in a one-sided relationship. They're choosing not to attend, which might be seen as a way to set boundaries. However, some might see it as cutting off a long-time friend without giving them the chance to address the situation.\n\nThe author's reasoning includes understanding the bride's choice but still feeling hurt. They're not in the wrong for feeling that way, but the decision to not attend could be seen as a personal choice. However, weddings are important events, and not attending might be perceived as a rejection, especially if the bride didn't communicate properly. The author didn't confront the bride about their feelings, which could have been a step to resolve the issue before deciding not to attend.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for their feelings, but the decision to not attend might be seen as harsh. They might have wanted to express their hurt and then decide whether to attend regardless. Since they're prioritizing their own feelings and future relationships, there's a valid argument for their decision. However, some might think attending is better to maintain the friendship, even if it's painful.\n\nConsidering all points, the answer hinges on whether the author's action is a justified boundary or a hasty decision. The key is that the author hasn't given the bride a chance to explain or mend the situation. If they had, maybe the outcome would be different. But given the information, the author's choice to not attend is a personal one, and they aren't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their own emotional well-being.\n"
