I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding since they're not a bridesmaid. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend is getting married, and the author was surprised she found out via Facebook instead of being told directly. The author assumed they would be the maid of honor because their friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. Then, the author found out the other person was chosen as the maid of honor, and now it's clear the author isn't in the wedding party at all. The author is hurt but still considering not attending the wedding, which is a few states away, because it's not worth the effort and they don't want a one-sided friendship anymore. They\u2019re asking if they\u2019re in the wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending. Let's break it down.\n\nWeddings are big events, and attending is often expected, even if you're not part of the wedding party. The author is a 15-year friend, which is significant. Not attending might be seen as a slight. But the author feels hurt because they weren't included in the wedding party, which is understandable. They might feel unappreciated or that their friendship isn't valued. The author is also considering the cost and effort involved, which is practical. However, the author is planning to cut off contact after this, which might indicate deeper issues in the friendship.\n\nOn one hand, attending a close friend's wedding is customary. Not attending could be seen as rude, especially if the friendship is long-standing. Even if they aren't in the wedding party, showing support is expected. On the other hand, the author is hurt and feels the friendship has become one-sided. The friend didn't reach out directly, included them in the wedding party, or maybe maintained contact over the years. If the friendship has drifted, the author might feel justified in not attending. But cutting off contact entirely might be harsh if there's no prior issues.\n\nThe key points are: the author's feelings of being slighted, the practicality of attending a distant wedding, and the history of the friendship. The friend's actions (not informing directly, not including in the wedding party) could contribute to the author's decision. But social norms often prioritize attending weddings regardless of being in the party. However, if the friendship is already strained, maybe the author is right to set boundaries.\n\nI think it's a balance. The author might be in the right if the friendship has deteriorated, but there's a social expectation to attend. However, given the friend's behavior (not informing first, excluding from the party), the author's decision might be understandable. So, perhaps the answer is B (not in the wrong), but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
