I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be in the wedding party. They were best friends for 15 years, and the friend was their maid of honor two years ago. Now, the friend chose someone else as maid of honor, and the person feels hurt and excluded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around weddings. Generally, attending a friend's wedding is seen as important, especially if they were close. Even if you're not in the wedding party, showing up is usually expected as a sign of support. The person mentioned they would have to spend money and take time off work, but they're considering skipping because they're hurt.\n\nThe key points here: The friend didn't inform them first, which might have caused the hurt. The person feels the friendship is one-sided now. They're not attending, which could be seen as cutting off contact. But is it their fault? The friend made choices about the wedding party, which can be subjective. The person is reacting by not attending, which might be seen as a valid choice if they feel unappreciated, but also as selfish because weddings are significant events.\n\nOn one hand, the author's feelings are valid\u2014they were close and expected a certain role. On the other hand, the friend has the right to choose her wedding party. The author is deciding to not attend, which might be a way to set boundaries, but it could also be seen as avoiding the situation. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether attending is a social obligation versus a personal choice. If the author feels it's one-sided and doesn't want to continue the friendship, not attending could be a way to express that. However, skipping a wedding might be seen as a big deal regardless of being in the party. But maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're prioritizing their feelings and choosing their own boundaries.\n"
