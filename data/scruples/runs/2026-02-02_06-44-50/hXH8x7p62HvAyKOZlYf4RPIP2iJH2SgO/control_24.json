I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the main issue is whether not attending the friend's wedding because they didn't include her in the wedding party is justified.\n\nFirst, the user has been friends with this person for over 15 years. They thought they were close, especially since the friend was maid of honor at their wedding. Now, the friend is getting married and chose someone else as maid of honor, and the user isn't in the wedding party. They feel hurt and embarrassed, and are considering not attending.\n\nThe user is asking if they're the a**hole for not attending. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider cultural norms and expectations. In many cultures, attending a close friend's wedding is considered important regardless of being in the wedding party. The wedding is a significant event in someone's life, and friends often expect their close friends to be there, even if they aren't in the bridal party. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that since they're not in the wedding party, it's not worth the expense and effort. They also mention drifting apart, which might be a factor. But was the main issue their decision to not attend, or the assumption they should be in the wedding party?\n\nThe user was hurt by not being told first and not being in the wedding party. But the friend might have different reasons for choosing the wedding party, like closer current relationships or personal preferences. The user's reaction is to withdraw from the friendship post-wedding, which could be seen as cutting off contact over this issue.\n\nHowever, attending a wedding is typically a courtesy between friends, unless there's a specific reason not to, like financial constraints or personal emergencies. The user isn't facing a major hardship; it's just an expense. So not attending might be seen as self-centered, especially since the user acknowledges it's the friend's day.\n\nBut the user feels it's a one-sided friendship now. If the friend didn't include them in the wedding party, maybe the user feels unappreciated. However, the decision to attend a wedding is separate from being in the bridal party. Close friends usually attend regardless.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user's hurt feelings are valid, but the decision to skip the wedding might be seen as prioritizing their feelings over the friendship. The friend might expect attendance despite not being in the wedding party. So the user could be in the wrong for not attending. \n\nBut wait, the user also mentions they don't plan to stay in contact after. That's a significant point. If they're ending the friendship, maybe the decision to not attend is part of that. So the user might not be in the wrong if they're ending the friendship, but the act of not attending a wedding might still be seen as harsh.\n\nHmm. It's a bit of a grey area. On one hand, attending a friend's wedding is customary. On the other, if the friendship is ending, maybe it's acceptable not to attend. The user feels it's a one-sided friendship, so maybe they're justified in pulling away. The key is whether attending is expected regardless of the friendship's current state. \n\nIn many cases, even if the friendship has drifted, attending the wedding is still expected. Cutting off contact is one thing, but not attending the wedding might be seen as cruel. So the user might be in the wrong here. Alternatively, if the friendship is over, maybe it's okay. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the user is not in the wrong. They might be cutting off a friend, but the decision to not attend is a personal choice based on their feelings about the friendship. However, others might argue they should attend regardless. But since the user is ending the friendship, maybe not attending is a way to finalize that break, so they aren't necessarily wrong.\n"
