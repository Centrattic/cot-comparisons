I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend finding out about her friend's wedding via Facebook and not being asked as a bridesmaid, leading her to consider not attending.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend has known her for over 15 years, was the maid of honor at her wedding two years ago, but now she's not in the wedding party. The friend found out through Facebook, which might be a red flag because she expected to be told first. Then, she's deciding whether to attend the wedding without being part of the party.\n\nThe author argues that attending would cost money and time, and since she's not in the wedding party, it's not worth it. She also mentions drifting apart and not wanting a one-sided friendship anymore. \n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. Attending a wedding is a personal choice. Even if you're not part of the wedding party, attending is usually expected if you're a close friend. However, the friend's hurt feelings and the decision not to attend could stem from feeling slighted. But is it her responsibility to attend regardless?\n\nOn one hand, not attending might be seen as cutting off contact, especially after 15 years. On the other, she's not part of the wedding party, which might reduce the expectation to attend. The key question is whether the friend is being unreasonable in expecting attendance and whether the author is justified in her decision.\n\nThe author's main reasons are financial costs and feeling slighted. But in many cultures, attending is considered important unless there's a valid reason (like inability to travel). However, the author is choosing not to attend because she's not part of the party, which could be seen as holding a grudge. But maybe the friend's not being told first is a bigger issue. The friend might feel that since she wasn't informed, it's a sign of not being considered close anymore, which compounds the hurt.\n\nThe friend's decision to not attend might be a form of emotional response, which is understandable. However, the core of the question is whether this is the wrong action. The answer could hinge on whether attending is expected regardless of being in the wedding party. In many cases, yes, close friends attend even if not part of the party. So maybe the author is in the wrong by not attending. But if the friendship has been drifting, perhaps it's a valid decision.\n\nAlternatively, the author could be in the right if she feels the friendship isn't mutual anymore. But the AITA usually leans towards attending unless there's a concrete reason. The friend not being in the wedding party might not be a sufficient reason to skip the wedding. So, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because she's choosing not to attend a close friend's wedding without a strong reason beyond personal hurt feelings.\n"
