I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend not being invited to her close friend's wedding party and considering not attending the wedding as a result.\n\nFirst, the author is hurt because she wasn't told about the wedding first, which makes sense. They were friends for over 15 years, so she probably expected to be informed directly. But then, she assumed she'd be the maid of honor since the friend was her maid of honor at her wedding. However, the friend chose someone else, maybe a closer childhood friend. The author feels this is a slight, especially since they've drifted apart in recent years.\n\nNow, the author is considering not attending the wedding because she's not in the wedding party. The main question is whether it's acceptable for her to skip the event. The author argues that attending would be a financial and logistical burden, and she doesn't want a one-sided friendship anymore. She's hurt and wants to focus on friends who value her presence.\n\nOn one hand, the friend's decision to not include her in the wedding party is her right. The author might be taking it personally, but the friend might have valid reasons, like the other friend being closer recently. On the other hand, the author might feel that not attending is a way to protest or express her feelings. However, weddings are usually for important people in the couple's life, even if they're not in the bridal party. Not attending could be seen as cutting off a long-time friend, especially if the author is still on good terms otherwise.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that attending is a burden and she doesn't want to be in a one-sided relationship. But is it her responsibility to attend just because they were once close? Or is the friend's choice to not include her in the bridal party a reflection of their current relationship? \n\nIn some cultures or social norms, attending a friend's wedding is expected regardless of being in the bridal party. However, if the relationship has already deteriorated, maybe not attending is a way to set boundaries. But the author does say she's not planning to stay in contact, which suggests she's already moving on.\n\nI think the key points are: the author is hurt and feeling slighted, but the friend's choice isn't necessarily a personal attack. The author's decision to not attend because she's not in the bridal party might be seen as selfish, as it's a significant event in the friend's life. However, if the author feels the relationship is one-sided and she's already distancing herself, maybe her decision is justified. \n\nBut overall, attending a friend's wedding is a common courtesy, even if you're not part of the bridal party. The author might be making a big deal out of not being in the party, which could be the friend's personal choice. So, maybe the author is in the wrong by not attending, especially if her main reason is resentment over not being in the bridal party. However, if the relationship is already strained and she's planning to cut ties, perhaps it's her right to choose not to attend. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because attending a friend's wedding is generally expected unless there are major issues. But since the author is already planning to distance herself, maybe it's not entirely her fault. I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because she's letting the slight affect her attendance, which is a significant event for her friend. But if the friendship is ending, maybe not. I'm a bit confused. Wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the friend chose not to include her in the bridal party, it's the friend's decision, and the author is reacting by not attending. That could be seen as holding a grudge. So, the answer might be A.\n"
