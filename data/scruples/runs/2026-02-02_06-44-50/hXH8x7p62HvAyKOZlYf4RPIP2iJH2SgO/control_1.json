I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The main issue is whether they should attend their friend's wedding even though they're not in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, the friend found out about the wedding on Facebook, which might have been a bit hurtful. The author thought they'd be the maid of honor since their friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. But the friend chose someone else, and now the author is considering not attending because they're not in the wedding party. \n\nThe author mentions that they've drifted apart over the past few years. They also say they don't want a one-sided friendship anymore. So, maybe they're using the wedding as a way to distance themselves. But is it right to skip the wedding because they're not in the bridal party? \n\nWeddings are a big deal, and attending is usually expected, even if you're not part of the party. The friend might expect the author to be there, especially since they've been friends for 15 years. However, the author feels hurt and embarrassed. They also have to spend money and take time off work. \n\nBut the key point is the friendship dynamics. If the author feels the friendship has become one-sided, maybe they have a valid reason to step back. However, not attending a friend's wedding just because you're not in the party could be seen as cutting ties, which might be harsh. \n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to their feelings and can decide not to attend. On the other hand, a long-time friend might expect support. But since they've drifted apart, maybe the author is justified in prioritizing their own feelings. \n\nI think it's more about the author's feelings versus social expectations. The author isn't in the wedding party, so they might feel less obligated, but it's still a major event for the friend. However, if they're already planning to distance themselves, maybe it's a way to end the friendship respectfully. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they're honest about their feelings and choosing to focus on healthier relationships. Deciding not to attend is a personal choice based on their emotional state and the direction of the friendship.\n"
