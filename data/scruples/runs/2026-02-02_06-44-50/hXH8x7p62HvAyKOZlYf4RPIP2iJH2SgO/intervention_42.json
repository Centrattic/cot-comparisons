I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has a 15-year friendship with their friend. The friend didn't tell them about the wedding first, which was surprising. The author assumed they would be the maid of honor because the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding two years ago. But the friend chose another childhood best friend instead. The author feels hurt but understands the drift. Now, the author is considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nHmm. Weddings are big events, and attending is a social norm. Even if you're not in the wedding party, showing up is usually expected, especially for a close friend. The author is saying they don't want to attend because they're not in the wedding party, which feels like a passive-aggressive response. They're using the cost and effort as reasons, but also expressing hurt feelings. \n\nBut wait, the author is choosing not to attend, which can be seen as cutting off the friendship. They mention not staying in contact after. The friend might not realize the author is upset because they didn't communicate directly. The author didn't talk to the friend about their hurt feelings, which is important. If you're not attending because of being excluded, maybe they should have addressed it first. \n\nAlso, the author didn't ask to be in the wedding party. The friend might not have considered them, but the author could have made their feelings known. However, the friend didn't include them, which is a valid hurt. But not attending because of that... Well, it's their choice, but is it fair? Maybe the author is overreacting. Weddings are about the couple, but friends expect support. If you're not there, it might be seen as cutting them out. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is feeling used and wants to focus on mutual friendships. Maybe they're justified in not attending if they feel disrespected. But maybe they should attend to be supportive regardless. \n\nI think the key points are: 1. The author didn't confront the friend about their hurt feelings. 2. Not attending could be seen as a harsh reaction without communication. 3. Weddings are expected to be attended by close friends even if not in the party. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they're punishing the friend for not including them in the wedding party by not attending, without confronting the issue. They could have talked to the friend, expressed their feelings, and maybe still attended for support. Not attending without communication might be harsh. Therefore, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong).\n"
