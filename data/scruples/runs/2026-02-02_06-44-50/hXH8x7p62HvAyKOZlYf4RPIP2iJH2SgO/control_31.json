I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. The situation is that the friend didn't tell them first, which made them feel left out. They assumed they'd be the maid of honor since they'd been close, but the friend chose someone else. The author is hurt but still considering not going to the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the dynamics here. The friend didn't inform them first, which is a red flag. Normally, close friends would share such news directly. The author felt betrayed, which is understandable. They tried to reach out and even assumed their role, but the friend ended up choosing a childhood best friend instead. That drift in the friendship over the years is mentioned, so maybe the friend's priorities shifted.\n\nNow, the author is thinking about not attending because they weren't in the wedding party. They're hurt and don't want to be in a one-sided relationship anymore. The question is whether they're wrong for not attending. \n\nIn terms of social norms, attending a friend's wedding is usually expected, even if you're not in the party. But there are exceptions, especially if there's been a falling out. The author isn't rejecting the friendship entirely but is choosing to focus on more mutual relationships. The friend didn't communicate well, which led to the hurt feelings. The author's right to prioritize their emotional well-being is important. Not attending could be seen as a reaction to being slighted, which might be justified here.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that weddings are about the couple, and the guest list is their choice. The author's decision not to attend could be seen as childish or holding a grudge. But given the context of the friend not informing them first and the drift in their relationship, the author's feelings are valid. They're making a choice to protect their self-esteem and not invest in a one-sided friendship. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to their feelings and can decide how to allocate their time and resources. The friend's actions contributed to the hurt, so the author's response is a reasonable self-preservation move. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
