I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding after not being asked as a bridesmaid. \n\nFirst, the user's friend is getting married, and the user found out via Facebook instead of being told in person, which is a bit hurtful. They expected to be the maid of honor since their friend was the maid of honor at their wedding two years ago. But the friend chose someone else. The user then saw that others not as close were included in the wedding party, which made them feel even more hurt. Now, the user is considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party and don't want to invest time and money into a \"one-sided\" friendship anymore.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the user's feelings of betrayal from not being told first, the assumption they'd be in the wedding party, and the decision not to attend because they're not included. The user is feeling that their relationship is one-sided now. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, weddings are significant events, and attending is often seen as a gesture of support, even if you're not in the wedding party. But the user is hurt because they weren't included in the wedding party and felt the friendship has drifted. They also mention they don't plan to stay in contact. \n\nOn one hand, weddings are about celebrating the couple, and not being in the party shouldn't automatically mean you don't attend. On the other hand, the user's feelings are valid\u2014they were hurt by not being informed first and not being chosen. The user is making a choice based on the current state of the friendship. \n\nBut maybe there's an expectation that friends attend each other's weddings regardless of the role. However, the user is also justifying their decision based on the friendship being one-sided. If the friendship has indeed drifted, then not attending might be a way to set boundaries. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether attending a friend's wedding is a social obligation even if you're not in the party. Some might say yes, as it's a major milestone. Others might agree that if the friendship is deteriorating, it's reasonable to choose not to attend. The user isn't being vindictive; they're just not wanting to invest in a one-sided relationship. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're prioritizing their own feelings and the current state of the friendship. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
