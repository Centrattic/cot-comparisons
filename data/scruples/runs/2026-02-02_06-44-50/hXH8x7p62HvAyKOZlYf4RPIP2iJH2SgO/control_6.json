I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding. Let's start by breaking down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the user is a friend of 15 years. That's a long time. The friend got married two years ago with the user as her maid of honor, so the user expected the same role this time. But when they found out on Facebook instead of being told first, that's a red flag. The user was hurt because they thought they'd be in the wedding party, but the friend chose someone else. Now, the user is considering not attending because they're not in the wedding party. The question is whether that makes them the AITA (Acquitted or In The Wrong).\n\nThe user argues that attending would be a financial and time commitment, not worth it since they're already embarrassed. They also mention not wanting a one-sided friendship anymore and plan to cut contact. The friend's actions\u2014keeping the user in the dark, not including them in the wedding party\u2014seem hurtful. The user's response is to not attend, which could be seen as cutting ties, but maybe they feel justified given the friend's behavior.\n\nOn one hand, weddings are significant events, and not attending might seem like a big deal. But if the user feels disrespected and the friend didn't communicate properly, it's understandable. The user isn't refusing to attend just because they're upset about being excluded but because they feel the friendship has become one-sided. They're prioritizing their own feelings and moving on from a friend who hasn't prioritized them in return.\n\nHowever, some might argue that attending a friend's wedding is a basic courtesy, regardless of being in the wedding party. But the user's situation includes financial costs and the fact that the friend didn't reach out. The user was surprised by the Facebook post, which suggests the friend didn't treat them with the respect they expected. The user's decision to not attend could be a way to set boundaries after being hurt multiple times by the friend's actions.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for close friends to attend each other's weddings. But this isn't a typical situation because the user felt uninvolved and ignored. The friend didn't even inform them first, which is a breach of trust. The user's choice to not attend might be justified as a way to protect their self-esteem and avoid a painful experience.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the user isn't in the wrong. They're responding to a friend who hasn't treated them as a close confidante. Not attending is their choice to focus on mutual respect and meaningful relationships. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
