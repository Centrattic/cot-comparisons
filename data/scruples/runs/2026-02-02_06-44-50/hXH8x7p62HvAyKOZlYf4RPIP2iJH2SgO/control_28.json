I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding after not being asked to be in the wedding party. \n\nFirst, the author is a 15-year friend. They thought they'd be the maid of honor since the friend was their maid of honor. But the friend chose someone else. The author feels hurt but understands they've drifted apart. Now, the author is considering not attending because they're not in the wedding party. They also mention not wanting a one-sided friendship and plan to cut contact.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, attending a wedding isn't a requirement. Even if you're a close friend, people have their own reasons. The author might feel slighted, but they can choose to attend or not. However, not attending might be seen as a reaction to not being in the wedding party. The friend might expect attendance regardless. But the author's decision is based on their feelings of being undervalued. \n\nOn the other hand, weddings are big events, and not attending could be hurtful. But the author is also prioritizing their own feelings and time. Maybe they're justified in wanting to focus on friends who value them. The key points are mutual respect and understanding. The author isn't obligated to attend, but maybe they should consider the friendship's history. However, since they're not in the wedding party, perhaps they feel less compelled. \n\nI think the answer is B (No). The author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to make this choice based on their feelings, especially since they're not part of the wedding party. The friend should have discussed things earlier, but the author's decision isn't wrong.\n"
