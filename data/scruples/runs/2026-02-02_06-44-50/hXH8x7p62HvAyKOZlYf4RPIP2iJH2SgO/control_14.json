I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding after not being asked to be a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, the friend had a 15-year relationship. The author was surprised when they found out about the wedding online instead of being told first. They were hurt when they weren't chosen as the maid of honor, even though they had been the maid of honor in their own wedding. The friend chose someone else, and the author realized they weren't even in the wedding party. \n\nThe author is considering not attending because of the emotional hurt and the cost involved (travel, hotel, time off work). They also mention not wanting a one-sided friendship and plan to cut contact after this.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, attending a wedding is a personal choice. While the friend might feel slighted, the author has valid reasons for their decision. They were excluded from the wedding party, which is a significant role, and they're hurt. Not attending doesn't necessarily make them wrong. They're prioritizing their own well-being and respecting the friend's choice to include others instead. The cost is a factor, but the main issue is the emotional aspect. The author isn't obligated to attend if they feel it's not worth it for their mental state. The friend might be wrong for not handling the situation better, but the author's decision isn't necessarily their fault. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
