I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't invited to the wedding party, even though they expected to be.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend of 15 years didn't inform the author initially; the author found out on Facebook. They thought they'd be the maid of honor since the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. Instead, the friend chose another close friend. The author is hurt but understands the drift. Now, they're considering not attending because they're not in the wedding party, even though attending would require some effort but isn't a major hardship.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations the author had. They assumed they'd be part of the wedding party based on past reciprocation. The friend's actions might have been hurtful by not informing them earlier and not including them as expected. However, weddings are the couple's choice, and the bride decides the wedding party. The author is conflicted between feeling slighted and not wanting to attend a big event where they're not in the wedding party.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, not attending isn't inherently wrong. People have different reasons for attending or not. The hurt feelings stem from unmet expectations, which might be valid, but the author is choosing to distance themselves because they feel the friendship is one-sided. The friend didn't communicate well, which could contribute to the tension. The author isn't doing anything unethical by not attending, but some might argue that attending is a kind gesture despite the hurt. However, the author isn't obligated to attend. The problem is whether their decision is \"in the wrong,\" which depends on societal expectations versus the personal relationship dynamics.\n\nIn AITA cases, the community often looks at intent and consequences. The author's intent is to prioritize their feelings and set boundaries, which is understandable. The friend's actions might have been inconsiderate, but the author isn't at fault for not attending. So the answer is B (No).\n"
