I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting to attend her friend's wedding after not being asked as a bridesmaid. \n\nFirst, the situation: They're friends for 15 years. The friend was the maid of honor at the author's wedding two years ago. The author found out about the wedding through Facebook, which hurt. The author assumed they'd be the maid of honor but found out the friend chose another childhood friend. Then, the author realized they're not in the wedding party at all, which is disappointing.\n\nThe author is considering not attending because they're hurt and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship. They're thinking of focusing on other friends. The question is whether not attending is wrong.\n\nHmm. So, is attending a wedding a given, even if you're not in the wedding party? Well, weddings can be expensive and require time off, but maybe the expectation is that close friends attend regardless. But the author feels slighted because they weren't included in the wedding party, which is a big honor. \n\nThe friend didn't reach out first when the wedding was announced, which the author found hurtful. The author tried to connect after the Facebook announcement, but the friend might have been busy or thought they'd already communicated. The author's hurt feelings are valid because they had an unspoken expectation based on their past relationship.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for not attending? Well, not necessarily. It's their choice. Weddings are personal, and if the friendship has drifted, maybe the author is justified in reevaluating the relationship. The friend might not have realized how much not including the author in the wedding party would hurt. \n\nBut maybe the author should attend to be polite and not burn bridges. However, the author mentions they don't plan to stay in contact anyway. That's a key point. If the friendship isn't going to continue, maybe the author is right to not attend. However, some might argue that attending shows respect regardless of the circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is making a point about their friendship being one-sided, maybe they're justified. The decision is personal. The answer hinges on cultural norms and personal expectations. But in many cases, attending a close friend's wedding is expected, even if you're not in the party. However, the author's hurt and the lack of communication from the friend might tip the scales. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have valid reasons for feeling hurt and choosing to prioritize their own feelings and future friendships. The friend's actions (not informing first, not including in the party) contribute to the author's decision. The author isn't obligated to attend if they're not in the party and the friendship is already strained.\n"
