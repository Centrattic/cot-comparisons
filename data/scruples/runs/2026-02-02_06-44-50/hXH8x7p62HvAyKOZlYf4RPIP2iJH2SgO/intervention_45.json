I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The author is a friend of the bride for over 15 years. The bride didn't tell her about the wedding first; instead, the author found out on Facebook. They had a conversation about the wedding plans, and the author assumed she would be the maid of honor because the bride was her maid of honor in her own wedding. But then the bride chose someone else as maid of honor, another childhood friend. The author felt hurt but understood they had drifted. Then, when the author saw the list of the wedding party, she realized she wasn't included at all. Now, the author is considering not attending the wedding because she's not in the wedding party and finds it not worth the cost and effort, even though it's not a huge hardship. She also says she's not interested in a one-sided friendship and plans to cut contact after that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around weddings. Generally, attending a friend's wedding is seen as important, especially for someone who was close. But the author is not in the wedding party, which might change things. The bride might expect her friend to attend regardless of being in the party. However, the author feels hurt and maybe slighted by not being included. She's making a choice based on her feelings and the effort involved. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that since she's not part of the wedding party and the bride didn't include her in the initial announcement, she's using this as an excuse not to attend. But the fact that she was hurt and drifted apart might justify her feelings. However, even if the friendship has become one-sided, attending the wedding could still be a show of support. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is not being malicious; she's making a decision based on her own feelings and circumstances. The question is whether she's in the wrong for choosing not to attend. If the bride expects her to attend, then the author might be in the wrong. But if the friendship has deteriorated, maybe it's understandable. \n\nI think the key points are: the author found out on social media first, which might have caused some hurt, and then the exclusion from the wedding party. The author is using the exclusion as a reason to not attend, but maybe she should attend regardless. However, since she's planning to cut contact anyway, maybe she's just using the wedding as a way to end the friendship. In that case, she's not in the wrong for not attending, especially if the relationship has already become strained. \n\nBut traditionally, attending a friend's wedding is expected even if you're not in the party. However, the author's hurt feelings might affect her ability to enjoy the event. There's also the cost and effort, which are not insignificant but not impossible. So, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is being petty for not attending because she's not in the wedding party. If the bride didn't include her, maybe it's the bride's fault, but the author's decision to not attend could be seen as holding a grudge. On the other hand, if the friendship was already strained, the author is just ending a one-sided relationship. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because she's making a choice based on her own feelings and circumstances, and the bride didn't include her in the wedding party. But some might argue that attending a friend's wedding is expected regardless. So it's a bit tricky. But since the author is not being mean-spirited and is just not willing to invest in a one-sided friendship, maybe she's not in the wrong. Therefore, answer B.\n"
