I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding since they're not a bridesmaid. The situation involves a long-time friendship of over 15 years. The friend found out about the wedding on Facebook, which was unexpected. The author assumed they would be the maid of honor because the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding two years ago. \n\nThe friend ended up choosing another childhood friend as the maid of honor, and the author noticed that two other girls in the wedding party aren't close anymore. The author feels hurt but understands it's the bride's choice. However, the author is considering not attending because they're not in the wedding party and don't want to be part of a one-sided friendship. The cost and effort of attending are mentioned as not a major hardship but not worth it. They plan to cut contact afterward.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the length of the friendship, the emotional hurt, and the decision to not attend a major life event. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, attending a friend's wedding is common, even if you're not in the wedding party. Weddings are significant events where friends usually show up to support. The author's reasoning is that they feel slighted and want to focus on reciprocal friendships. But is it wrong to not attend? \n\nOn one hand, the author might feel that their exclusion from the wedding party is a sign of the friend drifting away. If they've already drifted apart, maybe this is a natural progression. On the other hand, weddings are important, and attending could be a way to maintain the friendship despite the hurt. \n\nHowever, the author's decision is based on their feelings of being undervalued. The friend didn't inform them first, which is a red flag. The bride's actions (waiting to announce the wedding and not including the author in the wedding party) might have contributed to the author's hurt. \n\nIn terms of social norms, attending a wedding is expected unless there's a valid reason. But here, the author is using their exclusion from the wedding party as a reason not to attend. It's a personal choice, but some might see it as a breach of the friendship. Others might empathize with the author's feelings and not hold it against them. \n\nThe key factors here are mutual respect and understanding. If the friendship has been one-sided, the author's decision might be justified. However, if the friendship is still valuable, attending could be seen as more mature. But since the author is planning to cut contact, maybe not attending is a way to detach.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're prioritizing their own emotional well-being and choosing to focus on reciprocal relationships. The bride's actions might have contributed to the author's decision. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
