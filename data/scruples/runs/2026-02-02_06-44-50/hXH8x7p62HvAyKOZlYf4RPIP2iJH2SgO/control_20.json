I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend in question has known the author for over 15 years. The author was surprised when they found out about the wedding via Facebook, expecting to be told first. They had a conversation about the wedding plans, assuming they would be the maid of honor since they were the maid of honor in the friend's wedding two years ago. But the friend chose a different childhood best friend for the maid of honor role. The author thought they would at least be a bridesmaid, but now it's clear they aren't in the wedding party at all. The author is hurt but understands it's the friend's choice. However, they're considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party, even though it's a few states away and requires some effort.\n\nThe key points here are the friendship dynamics. The author feels slighted for not being included in the wedding party, especially since they were the maid of honor before. The friend didn't inform them directly, which added to the hurt. Now, the author is deciding whether to attend the wedding, which they see as a significant effort. They mention not wanting a one-sided friendship and plan to cut contact if they don't attend.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending. To determine this, I need to consider social norms, the friendship's history, and mutual respect. Attending a friend's wedding is generally seen as a supportive act, especially for a long-time friend. Even if the author isn't in the wedding party, attending could show solidarity. However, the friend didn't communicate well, which might affect the author's feelings. The author might feel that their exclusion from the wedding party is a sign of the friend's drifting away, and the author wants to focus on friends who value their presence.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have her reasons for choosing different people for the wedding party, maybe due to the author's drifting apart. The author's decision not to attend could be seen as a reaction to feeling slighted, but it's also their choice. However, in many cultures, attending a friend's wedding is expected unless there's a strong reason not to. The author might be making a statement about their friendship, which could be valid if the relationship has changed.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If they're choosing not to attend because they're not in the wedding party, is that fair? It's possible that the author is using the exclusion as a justification to end the friendship. The author might be holding a grudge over not being in the wedding party, which could be a personal choice. However, weddings are about celebrating the couple, regardless of one's role. So, not attending might be seen as being petty, but the author's reasons are tied to their feelings of being undervalued.\n\nIn the AITA context, the community often looks at whether someone's actions are justified. The author isn't doing anything illegal, but the social expectation might weigh in. The friend's failure to inform them first and the author's prior role as maid of honor could tip the scales. The author's decision to not attend might be seen as a way to assert boundaries after feeling disrespected. Alternatively, it could be seen as cutting off contact over a misunderstanding.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's decision is reasonable given the circumstances. Since the author was a maid of honor in the friend's wedding, it's natural to expect a similar role in return. The friend's lack of communication and the exclusion from the wedding party might justify the author's hurt feelings. Choosing not to attend could be a way to express that hurt and set boundaries, which might be understandable. However, some might argue that attending is still the right thing to do regardless of role.\n\nBut considering the author's reasoning and the friend's actions (not informing first, choosing others for the wedding party), the author's decision not to attend could be seen as justified. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
