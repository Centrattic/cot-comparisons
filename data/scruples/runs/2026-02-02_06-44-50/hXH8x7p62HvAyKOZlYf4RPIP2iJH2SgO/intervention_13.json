I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a long-time friend's wedding. The author thought they were close enough to be the maid of honor, but their friend chose someone else. The author is now considering not attending the wedding because they're hurt and feel like the friendship is one-sided now. They're asking if they're in the wrong for not attending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the friendship. They were friends for 15 years, and the friend was the maid of honor at the author's wedding two years ago. That suggests a strong bond. But over the past few years, they've drifted apart. The author found out about the wedding on Facebook, which might be a red flag. The friend didn't tell them first, which could indicate some distance. Then, when the author assumed they'd be a bridesmaid, the friend chose someone else, including a childhood friend and people not close lately.\n\nThe author is hurt and feels slighted. They mention it's not a major financial hardship to attend but don't see the point now. They also don't want to stay in contact. The key points here are the emotional response, the decision not to attend, and the intention to cut ties.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, weddings are generally considered important events where attending is expected unless there's a good reason. The author's main reason is feeling hurt and not being in the wedding party. But is that a valid reason to skip the wedding? Some might say that attending is a sign of respect for the friendship, even if you're not part of the bridal party. Others might argue that the friend's choice to exclude them from the party reflects a shift in the relationship, and it's okay to prioritize their feelings and time if they feel the friendship is one-sided.\n\nI should consider cultural norms. In many societies, attending a close friend's wedding is expected regardless of one's role. If the author doesn't attend, it could be seen as cutting the friend off, which might be harsh, but maybe justified if the author feels disrespected. On the other hand, the friend didn't include the author in the bridal party, which could mean they value others differently now. The author might be protecting their own emotional well-being by choosing not to attend a potentially painful event.\n\nBut the author is using the exclusion from the wedding party as a justification for not attending. Is that a valid reason? It could be seen as holding a grudge. However, if the author feels the friendship is no longer mutual, maybe they're not wrong to distance themselves. The key here is whether the decision is based on resentment versus a mutual drift.\n\nThe author mentions they don't want to stay in contact, so cutting ties after the wedding might be their way of moving on. If they don't attend, it's a clear statement of ending the friendship. But is that fair? The friend might not even be aware of the author's feelings if they don't communicate. The author could have talked to the friend about their hurt feelings before making a decision, but they didn't. Instead, they're planning to skip the wedding and stop contact. That could be seen as abrupt.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's a judgment call. The author might feel justified in their actions, but from an outsider's perspective, not attending a long-time friend's wedding just because you weren't in the bridal party could be seen as cutting off someone who is still your friend, even if they made different choices. However, if the friendship has already deteriorated, maybe it's a reasonable decision.\n\nI think there are two sides here. The author's hurt is valid, but their response might be harsh. Attending the wedding could have been a way to show support despite the exclusion, which is a common social expectation. However, if the author feels the friendship is one-sided, they might not be in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being. The answer depends on cultural expectations and personal values. But given the scenario, maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong (B), but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
