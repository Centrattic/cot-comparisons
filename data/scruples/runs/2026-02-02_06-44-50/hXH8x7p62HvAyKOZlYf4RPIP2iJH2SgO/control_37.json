I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be in the wedding party. They were friends for 15 years, and they thought they'd be maid of honor since their friend was their maid of honor two years ago. But the friend chose someone else, and now the person is considering not going to the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around attending weddings. Generally, people do go to friends' weddings, even if they aren't in the wedding party. But there are exceptions. The person is hurt because they weren't included, which is understandable. The friend didn't reach out first; the person found out via Facebook. That might be a point of contention. The friend's choice to include others not close to her recently could indicate she's prioritizing different people now. The person feels the friendship is one-sided and plans to cut contact, which might justify not attending. But is it their fault for deciding not to go? \n\nOn one hand, weddings are important events, and not attending could be hurtful. But on the other hand, if the friendship is deteriorating, maybe it's a natural consequence. The person isn't being malicious; they're making a choice based on their feelings. The friend didn't inform them first, which is a breach of trust. The person is reacting to being excluded from the wedding party, which is a significant role. The cost and effort of attending might be a factor, but the emotional aspect is key here. \n\nI think the person isn't in the wrong because they're responding to being overlooked in a meaningful way. They're not cutting contact just because they don't like the wedding plans but because they feel undervalued. Choosing to not attend is a personal decision based on those feelings. The friend's actions started the situation, so the person isn't at fault here. Answer B.\n"
