I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend not being invited to the wedding party and considering not attending the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author and the friend have been friends for over 15 years. The friend was the maid of honor at the author's wedding, so the author expected to be in hers. However, she found out via Facebook that another friend was chosen as the maid of honor. The author is hurt but understands drifting apart. Then she sees others in the wedding party who aren't close, leading her to realize she's not in the wedding party. Now, she's considering not attending because she feels it's not worth the expense and effort, especially since she plans to cut off contact after.\n\nThe key points here are expectations vs. reality. The author expected to be a bridesmaid, maybe even maid of honor, but wasn't. That's understandable, but the friend's choice is her prerogative. The author is now considering not attending, which is a personal decision. The question is whether this decision makes her in the wrong.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, attending a friend's wedding is a common courtesy, even if you're not in the wedding party. Weddings are big events, and close friends are usually invited. However, the author is hurt and feels the friendship is one-sided. She's also planning to stop contact, which might influence her decision.\n\nIs it wrong to not attend? Well, the friend didn't invite her to the wedding party, but did she invite her to the wedding at all? The post doesn't mention that. If the author wasn't invited, then she's not in the wrong. But if she was invited and is choosing not to go, then maybe there's an expectation to attend. The post says the author found out via Facebook, so maybe she wasn't directly invited. That's a key detail. If she wasn't invited, then not attending isn't wrong. But if she was invited and is refusing, that's different.\n\nAlso, the author mentions not wanting to invest in a trip and time off because she's hurt. Is it selfish to prioritize her feelings over attending? Some might say yes, others no. But if the friend excluded her from the wedding party, maybe the author feels it's a sign of the friendship changing. The author is choosing to end the friendship, which is her right. However, attending the wedding could be a way to maintain closure or show support, even if it's painful.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I might see it differently. If the friend didn't include her in the wedding party, maybe the author is reacting in a way that prioritizes her own feelings, which is understandable. But social norms often expect attendance unless there's a good reason. However, the author's reason is valid\u2014feeling unappreciated and planning to end the friendship. So, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if she was invited and the friend expected her to come, then not attending could be seen as rude. But since the author wasn't in the wedding party, maybe the expectation isn't there. It's a bit of a grey area.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether she was invited to the wedding. If she was, then not attending without explanation could be seen as inconsiderate. If she wasn't invited, then she's not in the wrong. The post says she found out via Facebook, so maybe she wasn't directly invited, but it's possible she was still on the guest list. If the friend didn't include her in the wedding party but still invited her, the author's choice to not attend is a personal one. But if she wasn't invited, then it's not her fault.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author might not be in the wrong because she's reacting to being excluded from the wedding party and the friendship dynamics. However, social expectations vary. But given the information, I lean towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
