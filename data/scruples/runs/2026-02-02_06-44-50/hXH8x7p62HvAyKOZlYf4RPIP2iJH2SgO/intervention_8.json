I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding after not being asked as a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has known the bride for over 15 years. The writer thought they would be the maid of honor since they were the maid of honor in the writer's wedding. But the bride chose someone else, maybe a childhood friend. The writer found out via Facebook, which was unexpected. Now, the writer is considering not attending the wedding because they weren't in the wedding party.\n\nThe writer's reasoning is that they don't want to attend a one-sided friendship anymore. They mention that they are hurt but also want to focus on friends who value their presence. However, attending a wedding involves costs and time, which they consider not worth it now.\n\nI should consider cultural norms here. Typically, attending a close friend's wedding is seen as important, regardless of being in the wedding party. Weddings are significant events, and not attending could be seen as cutting off the friendship. But the writer is also hurt and feels the friendship has drifted. They might feel that the friend doesn't value their friendship as much now.\n\nThe key points are: the friendship's history, the emotional hurt of not being included, and the decision to not attend. The writer isn't in the wedding party, which might lead them to feel excluded. But is it acceptable to skip the wedding for that reason?\n\nOn one hand, weddings are about celebrating the couple, and not being in the wedding party doesn't mean you shouldn't attend. On the other hand, the writer feels the friendship is one-sided and wants to move on. They might be using the wedding as a way to end the friendship.\n\nBut is the writer in the wrong? Attending a wedding is a personal choice, but given their long-term friendship, skipping it could be seen as harsh. The writer's decision might come off as holding a grudge. However, the bride didn't inform the writer first, which could add to the hurt. The writer might feel disrespected by being found out via Facebook.\n\nIn some cases, people might understand the writer's perspective, especially if the friendship has been drifting. But the expectation to attend a close friend's wedding is strong in many cultures. The writer's reasoning about the friendship being one-sided is valid, but using the wedding as the cutoff might be abrupt.\n\nI need to balance the hurt feelings and the expectations of attending a wedding. The answer might depend on cultural context and personal values. However, generally, skipping a close friend's wedding is a big deal. So the writer might be in the wrong if they're not considering the importance of the event despite being excluded from the wedding party.\n"
