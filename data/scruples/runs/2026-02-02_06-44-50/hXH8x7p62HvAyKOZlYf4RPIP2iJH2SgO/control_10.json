I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is a friend of over 15 years who wasn't invited to be a bridesmaid in her friend's wedding. The friend was the maid of honor at the author's wedding two years ago. The author found out about the wedding on Facebook, which hurt because she expected to be told first. Then she learned the friend chose another childhood best friend as maid of honor, and other people for the wedding party who aren't close anymore. The author is considering not attending the wedding because she's not in the wedding party and feels it's not worth the expense and effort. She plans to cut off contact after this.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for not attending. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me think about the factors here. Friendships, especially long-term ones, come with expectations. The author expected to be in the wedding party since she did the same for her friend. The friend didn't inform her first, which is a big deal. Then, when the author found out via social media, that's a common way people feel slighted. The friend chose someone else as maid of honor, possibly because they've drifted apart. The author feels hurt and now is considering not attending because she's not in the wedding party. \n\nIs attending a wedding a given even if you're not in the wedding party? Well, weddings are usually for friends and family, so even if you're not part of the party, you're expected to attend. But maybe the author feels it's one-sided now because the friend didn't include her in the same way she did. The author mentions it's not a major hardship but doesn't see the point, and wants to focus on reciprocal friendships.\n\nThe key here is whether the friend's actions (not inviting as a bridesmaid, not informing first) justify not attending. The author might feel the friendship has become one-sided, especially if they've drifted apart. The friend might have her own reasons for choosing the wedding party, but the author's feelings are valid. \n\nIn terms of social norms, not attending a close friend's wedding without a good reason is frowned upon. But if the friendship has deteriorated and the friend has been distant, maybe it's understandable. The author isn't being petty but is making a choice based on past behaviors and future intentions.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the friend's actions were hurtful, then the author's reaction is a self-respecting move. However, if attending is a basic expectation regardless of the wedding party, then the author might be wrong. But considering the context of the friendship drifting and the friend's choice, the author's decision seems more like a coping mechanism rather than being inconsiderate. \n\nAlso, the author isn't refusing to attend out of spite but because of the situation. They are also planning to cut contact, which is their choice. The AITA community often looks at intent and circumstances. If the author is making a statement about the friendship's imbalance, it's not necessarily being an asshole. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because she's prioritizing her own feelings and recognizing that the friendship has lost its mutual support. Not attending isn't out of spite but acceptance of the situation and future intentions.\n"
