I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author has been friends with their friend for over 15 years. They were hurt when they found out about the wedding on Facebook instead of being told first. The author assumed they would be the maid of honor since their friend was the maid of honor at their wedding two years ago. But the friend chose another childhood best friend for that role. The author thought they\u2019d still be a bridesmaid, but it turns out they aren\u2019t in the wedding party at all. Now, the author is considering not attending the wedding because they\u2019re hurt and plan to cut off contact after.\n\nFirst, the author\u2019s feelings are understandable. Being excluded from the wedding party can be really hurtful, especially after a long friendship. The friend didn\u2019t inform them first, which adds to the sting. However, weddings are the couple\u2019s event, and the decision on the wedding party is ultimately up to the bride. The author is choosing not to attend, which is their right, but they also mention not wanting to be in a one-sided friendship. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not attending. The key points here: the author is not in the wedding party, which is a personal choice by the bride. The author's decision to not attend could be seen as a reaction to feeling slighted, but it's also a personal choice. Attending a wedding isn't legally required, though there might be social expectations. However, the author is prioritizing their feelings and their own boundaries, which is valid.\n\nThe friend didn't reach out to explain the exclusion, which might have helped, but the author also doesn't plan to stay in contact. The author is making a choice that aligns with their current feelings about the friendship. So, is it wrong? Well, some might argue that attending is a courtesy, especially for a long-time friend's wedding. But others might say that if the friendship has been drifting and the author feels the relationship is one-sided, then not attending is a reasonable decision.\n\nIn terms of social norms, attending a friend's wedding is often expected, but it's not an absolute rule. The author is considering the costs (travel, time off) and feeling it's not worth it given the hurt. They're also choosing to focus on other friendships. So, the author's decision is a personal one, not necessarily in the wrong. The friend might have handled the exclusion differently, but the author isn't obligated to attend. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
