I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-time friend not being invited as a bridesmaid or maid of honor to her friend's wedding. The author is considering not attending because she wasn't in the wedding party and feels hurt, even though she acknowledges the wedding is the friend's day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in friendships and weddings. The author thought she'd be the maid of honor because her friend was the maid of honor at her wedding two years ago. However, the friend chose someone else, which the author is upset about. The author is now questioning whether it's acceptable to skip the wedding because she's not in the party.\n\nThe key points here are: \n1. The author is disappointed but seems to understand it's the friend's choice. \n2. She's considering not attending due to the hurt feelings and the effort required (travel, cost, time off). \n3. She mentions wanting to focus on more reciprocal friendships and not staying in contact with the friend after the wedding.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending. Weddings are typically attended by friends and family, not just those in the wedding party. The author is a long-time friend, so her absence might be hurtful, but it's her choice. The friend might feel hurt if she doesn't come, but the author has valid reasons for her decision. \n\nHowever, the author's reasoning includes a desire to avoid embarrassment and to move on from a one-sided relationship. That could be seen as self-preservation. On the other hand, not attending might be seen as cutting off the friend completely, which could be harsh. \n\nIn AITA contexts, people often expect attendees to go unless there's a good reason. The author's reasons are personal but valid. The friend didn't invite her to the party, so maybe it's a bit extreme to attend just to be there. But maybe there's an unspoken expectation that close friends attend regardless. \n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She's making a choice based on her feelings and the dynamics of the friendship. The wrong would be on the friend if she expected the author to attend without being in the party. But the author is within her rights to decide not to go, especially if she feels the friendship has become one-sided. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
