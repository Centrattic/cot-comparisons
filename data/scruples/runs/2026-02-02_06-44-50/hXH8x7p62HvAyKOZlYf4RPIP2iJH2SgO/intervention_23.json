I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person in the AITA question is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person has been friends with someone for over 15 years. Their friend got engaged, but they found out on Facebook instead of being told first. They congratulated her and talked about wedding plans, thinking they might be the maid of honor since the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding two years ago. Then, the friend chose another childhood best friend as the maid of honor. The person was hurt but understood they had drifted apart. They still expected to be a bridesmaid. Later, they saw the wedding party list and realized they weren't included at all. Now, they're considering not attending the wedding because they're hurt and feel it's a one-sided friendship. They don't want to spend money on a trip, and they plan to cut off contact after this.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending the wedding. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, the friend's actions: she didn't inform the author first about the engagement, which might be a breach of the expected close friend's role. The author assumes they would be in the wedding party, especially since they returned the favor before. But the friend chose others, possibly because their relationship has drifted. It's her wedding, so she gets to decide who's in her party.\n\nThen the author's decision not to attend. Is that wrong? Well, attending a wedding is a personal choice. If the author feels hurt and wants to cut off contact, that's their right. However, they still have a long-term friendship. Not attending might be seen as cutting ties, especially since they were close. But the author mentions they already plan not to stay in contact. The cost and effort of attending might be a factor. The author isn't obligated to attend unless there's a prior agreement.\n\nBut maybe the author is overreacting? They could attend as a guest even without being in the wedding party. Not attending could be seen as a big deal. However, if the author feels it's a one-sided friendship, they have the right to prioritize their time and money. The friend's decision not to include them in the wedding party doesn't mean they can't attend as a guest. So the author might not be in the wrong here because attending is a personal choice, especially if they feel the friendship is no longer mutual.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be acting out of hurt and not wanting to confront the situation. They could be cutting off contact over a misunderstanding or a lack of communication. Maybe the friend had reasons for not informing them first or choosing a different maid of honor. The author could have asked directly instead of reading Facebook. But the friend didn't reach out first, which might be part of the problem.\n\nIn terms of social expectations, usually, close friends are invited to the wedding regardless of being in the wedding party. So the author might feel it's unfair they aren't in the party, but they can still attend as a guest. Choosing not to attend might be a way to vent hurt feelings, but it's their right. The question is whether it's reasonable. If they can't attend due to personal feelings, they aren't necessarily in the wrong. However, if the decision is based on resentment and not attending as a form of punishment, that might be seen as wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision to not attend is a personal choice. They are allowed to prioritize their time and resources. The friend might be in the wrong for not keeping them informed first and not being in the wedding party. The author isn't obligated to attend if they feel the friendship is one-sided. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
