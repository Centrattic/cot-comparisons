I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is a friend of 15 years who wasn't included in the wedding party and now is considering not attending the wedding. The main points to consider are the friendship dynamics, the author's feelings, and social expectations.\n\nFirst, the author found out about the wedding on Facebook, which might be a point of hurt. Then, when they assumed they'd be maid of honor (since they were maid of honor in the friend's wedding), but the friend chose someone else. The author drifted apart over the years, so maybe that's why the friend didn't include them. The author is now considering not attending because they're not in the wedding party and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not attending. Social norms usually dictate attending a friend's wedding regardless of being in the wedding party. Not attending could be seen as disrespectful, even if hurt or offended. The author is using the lack of a role as a reason to not attend, which might be a way to avoid the social obligation. However, the author is also trying to prioritize their own feelings and set boundaries, which is understandable. But culturally, weddings are significant events where friends are expected to attend unless there's a strong reason not to.\n\nThe author's reasoning seems a bit self-centered. They mention not wanting to attend because they're hurt, but it's their friend's special day. The fact that they were not included in the wedding party is a personal choice of the friend, which the author might not have control over. Choosing not to attend could further strain the friendship, especially if the friend didn't realize the hurt caused by excluding them. The author could have addressed their feelings more directly with the friend, perhaps asking why they weren't invited to the party or expressing their disappointment. Instead, using attendance as a bargaining chip might be seen as holding a grudge.\n\nOn the flip side, the author is within their rights to attend or not attend. However, typically, attending is expected. The author's decision might be justified if the friendship was already deteriorating, but they are cutting off contact entirely. Maybe the author is overreacting to the exclusion by making a big decision about attending. They could still attend, express their feelings, and then decide about the friendship later. By deciding not to attend, they might be missing an opportunity to confront the situation maturely.\n\nSo considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because attending the wedding is a social expectation unless there's a valid reason. Choosing not to attend based on not being in the wedding party could be seen as holding a grudge and being disrespectful. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
