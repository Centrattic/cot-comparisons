I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be in the wedding party. \n\nFirst, the author was close friends for 15 years. They assumed they would be the maid of honor since the friend was their maid of honor in their wedding. But the friend chose someone else, and the author wasn't even in the wedding party. They found out through Facebook, which hurt them.\n\nThe author is considering not attending the wedding because they're hurt and feel it's one-sided. They mention it's not a major hardship but question if it's worth it. They also say they don't want to stay in contact anymore.\n\nI need to consider social norms. Typically, attending a friend's wedding is expected, even if you're not in the party, especially if you're a close friend. However, the author feels hurt and might see this as a sign of being excluded. Some might argue they should attend for the friend's sake, others that their feelings are valid and they have the right to prioritize their own well-being.\n\nAlso, the friend didn't inform them directly, which is a point of hurt. The author might feel disrespected. But the friend has the right to choose her party, even if it's different from expectations. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the author doesn't attend, is that wrong? It's a tough call. The author's decision is based on personal feelings and the friendship's state. If they don't attend, maybe they're cutting off contact, which they're already planning. So maybe they're not in the wrong. But some might say attending is important regardless. \n\nThe key points are the friendship's history, the friend's actions (not informing, choosing others), and the author's feelings. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is standing up for their own feelings and the friendship's decline.\n"
