I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. The question is whether they're in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The friend found out about the wedding on Facebook, which was unexpected. They assumed they'd be the maid of honor since the friend was their maid of honor two years ago. Then they saw the other friend was chosen, and later realized they weren't even in the wedding party. The author is considering not attending because they feel hurt and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations the author had. They thought they'd be a bridesmaid, especially given their past friendship and the reciprocal role in their own wedding. However, the friend didn't ask them, which could be due to drifting apart. The author is hurt but acknowledges it's the friend's choice. They're questioning if it's acceptable to skip the wedding now.\n\nIn terms of social norms, attending a close friend's wedding is typically expected, even if you're not in the wedding party. Weddings are significant events, and not attending might be seen as cutting someone out after a long friendship. The author is using the excuse of not wanting to invest in travel and time, but the real issue seems to be hurt feelings and a desire to distance themselves.\n\nHowever, the friend's actions\u2014finding out on social media first, not being in the wedding party\u2014might have contributed to the author's feelings. The author feels disrespected or undervalued. But is it the author's fault for expecting to be in the wedding party? Maybe, but the decision to attend a wedding is personal. The question is whether it's wrong to not attend because of not being chosen as a bridesmaid.\n\nSome might say the author is overreacting because it's the friend's choice who to include. Others might empathize with the hurt and think attending is optional. But in many cultures, attending a friend's wedding is important unless there's a good reason. The author's reasoning is based on their own emotional response, not on a clear wrong by the friend.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they choose not to attend, are they being petty? Or is it understandable given the situation? The answer depends on cultural expectations and personal boundaries. But generally, attending a close friend's wedding is expected. Not attending could be seen as a withdrawal from the friendship, which the author is already planning to do. So maybe they're not in the wrong for choosing not to attend, but they might miss out on a meaningful event. However, the initial assumption of being a bridesmaid might have been unrealistic if the friendship had drifted. The friend might not have kept them updated due to the drifting, not malice. So the author's hurt is valid, but expecting to attend might still be the norm. Hmm, this is tricky. I think the answer could go either way, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they are respecting their own feelings and the friendship has already changed.\n"
