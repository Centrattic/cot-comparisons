I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the friend found out about the wedding on Facebook, which might have been a red flag. They thought they'd be the maid of honor since their friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. But then another friend was chosen, and the author feels hurt. They drifted apart, but still expected to be a bridesmaid. Now they're not in the wedding party at all and are considering not attending because of that.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong for deciding not to attend. Well, weddings are personal, and the couple gets to decide who's in their party. The author's friend has the right to choose her wedding party, even if it's someone else. The author might feel slighted, but it's her day, so that's her choice.\n\nNow, attending the wedding is a separate issue. Even if you're not in the wedding party, it's customary to attend unless there's a good reason. The author is using their exclusion from the party as a reason not to go. But is that a valid reason? Maybe not. The author is choosing to not attend because of hurt feelings, which might come off as petty. Also, they mentioned not staying in contact after this, so maybe they're cutting ties, which is their choice, but not attending the wedding could be seen as cutting off more than just contact.\n\nBut then again, the author is considering the cost and time. It's a few states away, so it's a significant commitment. But if they're an important friend, attending might be the respectful thing to do regardless of being in the wedding party. The author's reasoning is based on feeling unappreciated and maybe the friendship being one-sided now. If they've drifted apart, maybe the friendship isn't as strong as before, so not attending isn't entirely wrong. However, the way they're framing it\u2014using the wedding party as the reason\u2014could be where they're in the wrong. It's possible that the friend didn't invite them to the wedding at all, but the post doesn't say that. Wait, the user says they saw the wedding party listed, but it doesn't mention if they were invited to the wedding itself. If they were invited, not going because they weren't in the party is an issue. If they weren't invited, then maybe not attending is justified. The original post says the author hasn't been invited to the wedding, right? Let me check again. The author says they found out on Facebook and sent a message, but there's no mention of being invited. Wait, the user's question is about not attending the wedding because they're not a bridesmaid. So maybe the author is assuming that if they're not in the wedding party, they don't need to attend. But typically, you're invited to the wedding regardless of being in the party. So if the author isn't invited, then they can't attend. But if they are invited, not attending because they're not in the party is their choice, but it's considered inconsiderate. The key here is whether the author is being inconsiderate or standing up for their feelings. The author feels the friendship is one-sided now, so cutting contact isn't the issue. The main issue is not attending the wedding. If the author isn't invited, they have no obligation. If they are invited, then not attending is a choice. The problem is the reasoning. The author is using their exclusion from the party as a reason to not attend, which might be holding a grudge over something that's the bride's decision. So in that case, the author is in the wrong. But if the author was never invited, then it's different. The original post doesn't specify if the author is being invited to the wedding. Let me check again. The user wrote: \"since I am not a bridesmaid... WIBTA for not attending the wedding?\" So they're wondering if not attending is wrong. The friend hasn't sent an invitation, or has the author been invited? The post says they found out on Facebook, sent a message, talked about wedding plans. Maybe they were invited later. The original scenario is a bit unclear. If the author is not being invited to the wedding at all, then not attending is not their fault. But if they are being invited, then not attending because they're not in the party is their choice. However, the author might be conflating not being in the wedding party with not being invited. The problem is, the author's reasoning is based on feeling hurt. They might be in the wrong for making attendance conditional on their role, which isn't the bride's responsibility. The bride isn't obligated to include the author, so not attending is a bit of a petty response. But if the friendship has deteriorated, maybe it's understandable. So the answer might be A (in the wrong) if they're being invited, or B if not. But the original post doesn't clarify if the author is being invited. The user's scenario is that the author found out on Facebook, sent a message, and discussed plans. The bride might have invited them to the wedding but not made them part of the party. If that's the case, not attending is inconsiderate. If the author isn't invited, then it's not their fault. Since the post doesn't specify, maybe the assumption is that the author is being invited. So the answer would be A because the author is choosing not to attend due to personal hurt feelings over their role, which is their choice but considered inconsiderate. So the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
