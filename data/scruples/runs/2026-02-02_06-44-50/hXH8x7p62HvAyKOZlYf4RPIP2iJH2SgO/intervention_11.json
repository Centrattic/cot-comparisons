I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't included in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, the author is a friend of 15 years. They were surprised the friend didn't tell them first, then were hurt when they found out the friend chose someone else as maid of honor. The author assumed they would be in the wedding party but now isn't. They're considering not attending because they're embarrassed and feel the friendship is one-sided. They don't plan to stay in contact after.\n\nNow, the key points. The author's friend made choices about the wedding party, which can be personal and vary. The author is hurt, which is understandable, but is it their fault? Attending a wedding is a personal choice. While some might expect being in the party, others might see it as the bride's decision. The author is choosing not to attend due to feelings of being excluded and not wanting to invest in a one-sided friendship. \n\nAre they in the wrong? Well, attending a wedding isn't a requirement unless there's a prior expectation. The author's reasons are based on their feelings and perception of the friendship. The friend might feel slighted if the author doesn't attend, but the author is prioritizing their own emotional well-being. \n\nHowever, the author might be overreacting if the friend didn't communicate better. The fact that the friend didn't tell them first is a point. But the author is making a choice based on their own hurt feelings. It's a judgment call between personal feelings vs. social obligations. \n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're making a decision based on their own needs. So answer B.\n"
