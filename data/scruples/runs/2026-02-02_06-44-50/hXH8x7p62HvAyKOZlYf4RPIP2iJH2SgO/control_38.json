I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding after not being asked to be a bridesmaid. \n\nFirst, the friend found out about the wedding on Facebook, which was unexpected. She thought the friend would have told her first. Then, she assumed she'd be the maid of honor since the friend was her maid of honor at her own wedding two years ago. But instead, the friend chose another childhood best friend. The author feels hurt because they've drifted apart recently.\n\nNow, the author sees the wedding party list and realizes she's not part of it. She's considering not attending because it's a hassle and she's embarrassed. She's also thinking of cutting off contact post-wedding because she doesn't want a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nThe key points here are the feelings of hurt and betrayal from not being informed early or included in the wedding party. The author is making a choice based on her emotional response. But is it wrong to not attend a wedding if you're not part of the wedding party? \n\nTraditionally, weddings are for the couple to invite people they want. The author isn't obligated to attend unless there's a prior expectation. The friend might have expected her to come regardless, but the author feels the relationship has changed. \n\nThe author's decision not to attend is her way of coping with the hurt. It's a personal choice, and while it might disappoint the friend, the author has a right to prioritize her feelings. However, not attending could be seen as cutting off the friendship completely. \n\nBut the author mentions she already plans to stop contact after this. So she's not avoiding the relationship entirely but is using the wedding as a reason to stop. Is that fair? Maybe, but she's not in the wedding party, and attending might feel forced. \n\nIn the AITA context, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since attending a wedding is a choice, and the author has valid reasons for not wanting to attend, she's not in the wrong. The friend's decision to exclude her from the wedding party is unfortunate, but that doesn't obligate the author to attend.\n"
