I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't chosen as a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The writer is a 15-year friend of the bride. She was surprised when she found out about the wedding on Facebook, which she thought her friend would have told her first. She assumed she'd be the maid of honor since the friend was hers two years ago. But the friend chose someone else, another childhood friend. The writer is hurt but understands they've drifted apart. Now she's considering not attending because she's not in the wedding party and isn't interested in a one-sided friendship anymore. She's thinking of cutting contact after.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Let's break it down. The key points are: she's hurt and feels slighted, but she's choosing not to attend the wedding. Is attending expected? Weddings can be expensive and time-consuming, especially for someone not in the wedding party. But is it customary to attend even if not in the party? Some people might attend regardless if they're close friends, but others might not if they're not invited to the party. Wait, was she invited to the wedding at all? The post doesn't say she wasn't invited. The problem is she's not in the party, but maybe she's still a guest. If she's invited as a guest, not attending could be seen as cutting contact. If she's not invited, maybe it's a different story.\n\nThe bride didn't inform her first, which is a red flag. Maybe the bride didn't respect the friendship enough to tell her. The writer's friend is choosing others who aren't as close now, which is her choice. The writer is hurt and feels the friendship is one-sided now. She's not attending, which could be seen as a response to feeling unappreciated.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Attending a wedding is a personal choice. If the writer doesn't want to spend money and time on a wedding she wasn't part of the party for, maybe it's understandable. But maybe she should attend to maintain the friendship. However, she says she doesn't want a one-sided friendship anymore, so cutting contact could be her way of standing up for herself. \n\nThe bride's actions might be at fault for not telling her first and not including her in the party. The writer is reacting to that. So, maybe the answer is B, she's not in the wrong. She's prioritizing her own feelings and time. But some might argue that not attending is cutting off the friend. But the writer says she's not interested in a one-sided friendship, so it's a conscious decision. The bride's fault for not handling the situation better, but the writer's choice is her own.\n"
