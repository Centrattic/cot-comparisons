I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. The friend in question is getting married, and there's a history of a 15-year friendship. The author was surprised they weren't told first and felt hurt when they found out another friend was chosen as maid of honor. Now, they're considering not attending the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations. Generally, attending a close friend's wedding is seen as important, even if you're not part of the wedding party. Weddings are significant life events, and being a guest is often expected, especially for long-term friends. The author's main argument is that since they aren't in the wedding party, they feel the friendship has become one-sided and they don't want to invest in a one-sided relationship anymore. \n\nBut there are nuances here. The friend didn't inform them first, which could have been hurtful. The author was expecting to be asked to be a bridesmaid, given their history, but that didn't happen. The fact that the friend chose someone else might have been due to drifting apart, which the author acknowledges. \n\nHowever, not attending a wedding because you're not in the party might be seen as harsh. Even if you're not part of the wedding party, attending is a sign of support and respect. The author is using the wedding as a way to cut off contact, which could be a valid decision, but whether it's \"wrong\" depends on the situation. The author is prioritizing their feelings and redirecting their energy elsewhere, which is understandable, but socially, people often expect to attend weddings of close friends regardless of the wedding party status. \n\nAnother angle: the author isn't refusing to attend out of spite but because they feel undervalued. They might be processing their hurt feelings by removing themselves from the situation. However, not attending could cause more hurt for the friend, who might not realize the author's reasons. The author is also planning not to stay in contact, which is a significant decision. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's decision is based on emotional responses and a desire to protect their own feelings. While it's understandable, socially, there's an expectation to attend. But if the friendship has indeed become one-sided, it's a personal choice. The answer hinges on whether the author's action is inconsiderate or justified. If the friendship has deteriorated over the years, the author might not be in the wrong. However, if they're cutting off contact solely because they weren't in the wedding party, it could be seen as inconsiderate. The line between self-respect and social obligations is blurry here. \n\nI think the key point is that attending a wedding is generally expected, even if you're not part of the party. The author's reasoning is valid in terms of personal feelings, but from a social standpoint, not attending might be seen as a breach of etiquette. However, if the friendship is already strained, it's a personal choice. The user's answer is A, but the correct answer might be B because the author is making a personal decision based on their feelings, not necessarily wrong. But I need to check the nuances again. The author isn't being spiteful; they're reacting to feeling undervalued. So maybe B is correct.\n"
