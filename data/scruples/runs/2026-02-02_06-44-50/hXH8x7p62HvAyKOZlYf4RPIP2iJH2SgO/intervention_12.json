I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding because they weren't in the wedding party. Their friend didn't tell them about the wedding first and didn't include them in the wedding party, which hurt the author. The author is considering not attending, which might seem harsh.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The author assumed they would be a bridesmaid, especially since the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. But the friend chose someone else. The author feels hurt but also not interested in a one-sided friendship anymore. \n\nIs attending a wedding a cultural expectation? In many cases, yes. Even if you're not in the wedding party, attending is seen as a kind gesture, especially for a long-time friend. The author is making a choice based on their feelings, but maybe they should attend regardless. Not attending might be seen as punishing the friend for not including them, which could be unfair. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they don't plan to stay in contact after this. If they're already ending the friendship, not attending might be their way of moving on. But is that justified? Maybe, but maybe there's a middle ground. Attending the wedding could be a closure, even if they don't stay in touch. \n\nThe friend didn't inform them first, which is rude. But the author's response of not attending could be seen as cutting ties harshly. It's a balance between respecting their own feelings and considering the friendship. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's decision is a personal choice, but socially, attending might be expected. However, the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their feelings. But if the question is about being in the wrong, maybe the answer is not in the wrong (B), because attending a wedding is a personal choice, especially when there's hurt involved.\n"
