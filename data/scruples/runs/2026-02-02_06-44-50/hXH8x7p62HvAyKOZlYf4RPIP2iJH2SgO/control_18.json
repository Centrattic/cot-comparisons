I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't chosen as a bridesmaid. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the friend didn't tell the author about the wedding first, which is a bit odd. They found out on Facebook. The author thought they'd be the maid of honor since their friend was their maid of honor at their wedding. But then the friend chose someone else. The author felt hurt but understood they might have drifted apart. Then they saw the wedding party list and realized they weren't even a bridesmaid. Now they're considering not attending because they don't want to go if they aren't in the wedding party. They also mention they don't want a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nSo, the key points here are the friend's actions and the author's response. The friend not informing the author first is a red flag. Maybe that's a sign of drifting apart or the friend not valuing the friendship as much. The author isn't being mean by not going; they're hurt and choosing to focus on friends who value them. Attending a wedding is usually expected even if you're not in the party, but the author is saying it's not worth the effort because they're already hurt. Also, the author doesn't plan to stay in contact after, which adds to the tension.\n\nBut, is it the author's fault? Maybe they should have talked to the friend instead of just looking online. If they approached the friend and discussed their feelings, maybe that would be better. However, the friend's actions (not informing first, not including in the wedding party) could justify the author feeling they're not wanted. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing not to attend. They might be cutting ties because the friendship isn't mutual. The answer might be B (No) because the author has valid reasons for not attending, especially if they're not part of the wedding party and the friendship has already become distant. The friend's actions are questionable, so the author isn't at fault here.\n"
