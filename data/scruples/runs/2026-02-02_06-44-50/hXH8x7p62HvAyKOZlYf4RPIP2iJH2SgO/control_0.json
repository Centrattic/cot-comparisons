I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be in the wedding party. \n\nFirst, the friend of 15 years didn't tell them about the wedding first, which is a bit awkward. The user thought they'd be the maid of honor since their friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. But then the friend chose someone else. The user is hurt but still thought they'd be a bridesmaid. However, it turned out they weren't included at all. Now, they're considering not attending because they're embarrassed and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nHmm. Weddings are big events, and usually, close friends are expected to attend, even if they're not in the wedding party. Not attending might be seen as cutting off the friend. But the user feels hurt and wants to focus on friends who value them. They also mentioned they don't plan to stay in touch, which shows they're done with this friendship.\n\nOn one hand, it's the friend's day, and attending is a sign of support. On the other, if the friendship has been drifting and the friend didn't include them in the bridal party, maybe the user's decision is about setting boundaries. \n\nIs it wrong to prioritize their feelings and energy? Maybe the friend is at fault for not communicating better and drifting away. The user isn't obligated to attend, especially if they feel unappreciated. So, probably, the user isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
