I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a long-time friend getting married, but the author wasn't asked to be in the wedding party, and now they're considering not attending.\n\nFirst, the friend found out through Facebook, which is a bit awkward. The author thought they'd be the maid of honor since they returned the favor two years ago. But the friend chose someone else, maybe because their relationship has drifted. The author is hurt but seems to understand it's the friend's choice. However, since they're not in the wedding party, they're considering not attending because of the effort and cost involved. They also mention they don't want a one-sided friendship anymore and plan to cut off contact post-wedding.\n\nSo, the main question is whether it's wrong to not attend. Let's break down the factors. Traditionally, attending a close friend's wedding is expected, even if you're not in the wedding party. But there are exceptions. The cost and time involved could be a factor, but the author says it's not a major hardship, just not worth it. Also, the emotional aspect: feeling embarrassed and hurt. \n\nBut the key points here: the author is not in the wedding party, which might make attending less expected. The friend didn't inform them first, which adds to the hurt. The author feels it's a one-sided friendship now because the friend hasn't kept them close. They also mention not staying in touch after. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, weddings are big events, and attending is usually seen as important for close friends. But if the friendship has deteriorated, maybe the author is justified. However, the friend might expect their presence regardless. On the other hand, the author is allowed to have feelings and make their own choices. Maybe they're not in the wrong, but there's a social expectation to attend. However, if the friendship is already drifting and the author isn't in the wedding party, maybe it's reasonable not to attend. \n\nPossible answer: B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They are allowed to prioritize their own feelings and the state of the friendship. It's a personal decision, and while there's a social norm, each situation is different. The author's reasons are valid given the circumstances.\n"
