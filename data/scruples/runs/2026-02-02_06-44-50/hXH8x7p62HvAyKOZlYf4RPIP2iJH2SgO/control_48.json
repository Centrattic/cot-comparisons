I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a long-time friend who didn't invite them to her wedding, and now the author is considering not attending because they aren't part of the wedding party. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for deciding not to go.\n\nFirst, the author and the friend are friends of over 15 years. The author was surprised to find out about the wedding on Facebook, which probably hurt because they expected to be told first. Then, the author assumed they would be the maid of honor since the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding two years ago. But the friend chose someone else. The author was hurt but tried to understand that they've drifted apart. However, it turned out the author wasn't even a bridesmaid. The friend included others who weren't as close recently. \n\nThe author feels embarrassed and thinks it's not worth attending the wedding since they're not in the wedding party. They mention they live a few states away, so it's not a minor inconvenience. They also say they don't want a one-sided friendship and plan to cut contact after this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending.\n\nHmm. Weddings are big events, but they are the host's choice who to include in the wedding party. The author isn't being excluded from the wedding entirely, just not in the wedding party. Attending a wedding isn't a requirement, even if you're a friend. The author is choosing to not attend due to personal feelings. Is that wrong?\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were expecting a certain role based on past history. The friend didn't communicate well, which caused hurt feelings. The author is making a decision based on their own feelings and the value of the friendship. The friend might think the author is being petty, but the author isn't obligated to attend. The cost and effort involved are factors too.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people do attend weddings even if they're not in the party, especially if they're close friends. But if the friendship has deteriorated, maybe the author is justified in not attending. The author is also considering future contact, so maybe they're trying to set boundaries. \n\nBut is it wrong to not attend? Maybe not. The author isn't being rude; they're just prioritizing their own feelings. However, some might argue that a lifelong friend deserves to be there even if not in the wedding party. But the author is not being excluded from the event itself, just not part of the ceremony party. \n\nThe key points are: the friend's poor communication, the author's expectations not being met, and the author's decision based on their own emotional state. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong because they have the right to make their own choices about attending events based on their feelings. The friend might be at fault for not communicating better, but the author's choice to not attend isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
