I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" question is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend who the author expected to be a bridesmaid or maid of honor at her wedding. Instead, the author found out through Facebook that another friend was chosen, and now the author is considering not attending the wedding because she's not in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their friendship. They've been friends for 15 years, and the friend was the maid of honor at the author's wedding. The author assumed she would be in the wedding party this time, but the friend chose someone else. The author is now hurt and feels slighted. But the question is whether it's reasonable for the author to decide not to attend because she's not in the wedding party.\n\nFrom a social norms perspective, attending a friend's wedding is often considered a significant event, especially for a long-time friend. Even if you're not in the wedding party, it's common to attend out of respect and support. The author mentions that the wedding is in another state, which involves some expense and effort, but she's saying it's not worth it because of the embarrassment. \n\nHowever, there's a valid point about the friendship being one-sided. The friend didn't inform the author first, which is a red flag. The author might feel undervalued, especially since she was a key part of the friend's wedding. But does that justify not attending? \n\nThe key here is the author's reasoning for not attending. If the decision is based on hurt feelings and a sense of betrayal, it's understandable but perhaps not the most mature response. Weddings are about celebrating the couple, not about personal validation. The author might be conflating her own feelings about the friendship with the appropriateness of attending the wedding. \n\nAlso, the author mentions not wanting to be in a one-sided friendship anymore and planning to cut off contact. That seems like a separate issue. If the friendship has already deteriorated, maybe not attending is less about the wedding and more about ending the relationship. But even in that case, attending the wedding could be a respectful way to close the chapter. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If she's not attending because she's not in the wedding party, that might be seen as holding a grudge. However, if she feels the friendship is over, maybe it's her prerogative. But from a social standpoint, attending is expected unless there are other reasons (like conflict, etc.). Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not attending just because she's not in the wedding party.\n"
