I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding after not being asked to be in the wedding party. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has been friends with this person for over 15 years. They were at each other's weddings, so there's a history of mutual importance. The author expected to be the maid of honor after being the maid of honor in the friend's wedding. But the friend chose someone else, maybe a childhood best friend who they've drifted from. The author then found out that they aren't part of the wedding party at all. \n\nThe author is hurt and feels that since they're not in the wedding party, attending isn't worth the effort and cost. They also mention not wanting to stay in contact after the wedding. They're asking if they're the asshole for this.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Attending a friend's wedding isn't mandatory. Even though they've been friends for a long time, the friend might have made different choices for the wedding party. The author is hurt, which is valid. But the real issue is whether it's reasonable to expect to attend a wedding just because of past friendship.\n\nFactors to consider: The friend didn't inform the author initially, which might have contributed to the hurt feelings. The author is willing to travel, but it's a financial and time burden. The author is choosing to cut off contact after. \n\nIs it wrong to not attend? Weddings are personal; the friend can choose who's in the party. The author isn't obligated to attend. However, considering the history, maybe the friend's lack of communication (finding out via Facebook) is problematic. The author's decision to not attend might seem harsh because of the long friendship, but they're also not in the wedding party. \n\nSome might think the author is overreacting, but others might see the friend's actions as dismissive. However, the author is within their rights to choose not to attend. They are hurt but also recognizing that it's the friend's day. The key is that attending a wedding isn't a given, even for close friends. So the author isn't in the wrong for not attending. They might be cutting off contact, but that's their choice. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
