I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding after not being asked to be in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, the situation: They're a 15-year friend. The friend got married two years ago, and the author was her maid of honor. Now, the friend is getting married again, but the author wasn't asked to be in the wedding party. The author found out through Facebook, which hurt because they expected to be told first. They assumed they'd be maid of honor again, then thought they'd be a bridesmaid, but now it's clear they're not in the wedding party at all. The author is considering not attending because they feel it's not worth the effort and expense, and they don't want a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nSo, the key points here are the expectations vs reality. The author felt they had a close enough relationship to be in the wedding, especially since they were in the friend's wedding two years ago. But the friend hasn't included them this time. The author is hurt and feels slighted. Now they're considering not attending the wedding.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, attending a wedding is typically a social expectation, especially for close friends. Even if you're not in the wedding party, people usually attend out of respect and support. However, there are exceptions. If someone has a bad relationship with the couple, or if there are major issues, they might choose not to go. In this case, the author is hurt but still willing to attend if they were in the wedding party. Now that they're not, they're considering not going.\n\nBut is that reasonable? The friend made a choice about the wedding party, maybe due to changing relationships or different priorities. The author feels neglected, but the wedding is the friend's event. Attending the wedding is a sign of being a good friend, regardless of being in the party. Not attending might be seen as cutting off the friendship entirely, which could be hurtful. However, the author is saying they don't want a one-sided friendship and plan to stop contact after this. That might justify their decision, but it's a bit harsh if they're still trying to attend for the sake of the friendship. But the author is hurt and feels undervalued, which is valid. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might not have considered the author's feelings when choosing the wedding party. The author was expecting to be included, given the history. The friend's actions could be seen as a failure in communication or consideration. However, the author's decision to not attend could be seen as a response to feeling unappreciated. But weddings are usually attended even if you're not in the party. So maybe the author is overreacting. But maybe not, if the friendship has been drifting and the author feels it's time to move on.\n\nSo, considering all that, is the author in the wrong? If the answer is A (yes), then it's because attending is expected regardless of being in the party. If B (no), then it's because the author has valid reasons to feel hurt and choose to end the friendship.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong). The author's feelings are valid, and if they feel the friendship is one-sided and have decided to cut ties, not attending is a way to do that. However, some might argue that attending is polite. But given the context, the author's decision is understandable. The final answer is B.\n"
