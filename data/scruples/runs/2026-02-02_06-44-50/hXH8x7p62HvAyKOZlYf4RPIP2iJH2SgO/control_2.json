I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they aren't a bridesmaid. \n\nFirst, the friend found out about the wedding on Facebook instead of being told directly, which is a bit of a red flag. The writer assumed they'd be the maid of honor since their friend was in their wedding. But the friend chose someone else, and now the writer is hurt but understands they've drifted. Then they see the wedding party list, and they're not even there. \n\nThe writer is considering not attending because they're hurt and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship. They mention it's not a major hardship but they don't think it's worth it. The options are AITA\u2014Am I the Asshole? So the user wants to know if the author is wrong.\n\nIn terms of social norms, attending a wedding is usually expected unless there's a good reason. Not attending could be seen as cutting off contact or being petty. However, the friend didn't reach out, didn't include them in the wedding party, and the writer feels the friendship is one-sided. \n\nOn one hand, weddings are about celebrating the couple, and the writer is choosing not to attend due to personal hurt feelings. On the other hand, if the friendship has been drifting and the friend didn't make an effort to include them, maybe the writer has a point. \n\nBut culturally, attending a wedding is a gesture of goodwill. Not attending might be hurtful, even if the writer is upset. However, the writer is also making a stand by not attending and cutting off contact. It's a bit of a mixed bag. \n\nThe key points are: the friend didn't tell them first, didn't include them in the party, and the writer feels disrespected. The writer is choosing not to attend. Is that wrong? The answer might be that attending is expected unless there's a valid reason. Since the writer is not in the wedding party, maybe it's understandable not to attend, but it's still a personal choice. \n\nBut the question is if they're in the wrong. If the writer is cutting off contact and not attending, maybe they're not wrong if they feel the friendship is one-sided. However, maybe they should attend out of respect. \n\nHmm. The options are A for yes (author is wrong) and B for no. So, considering the situation, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're choosing not to attend a distant wedding due to feeling unappreciated. Friends should support each other, but if the friendship is one-sided, maybe it's okay. However, not attending a wedding could be seen as harsh. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong because they should attend regardless. But given the circumstances of being excluded from the wedding party and the drift, maybe not. \n\nI think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they're making a choice to not invest in a one-sided friendship. But they might be a T, not an A. Wait, the options are AITA. The answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
