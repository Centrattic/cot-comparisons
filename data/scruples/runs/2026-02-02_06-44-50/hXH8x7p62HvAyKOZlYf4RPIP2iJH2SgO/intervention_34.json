I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The friend of 15 years got married first, and the author assumed they'd be the maid of honor since the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. But now the friend chose someone else, and the author is hurt. They found out through Facebook, which adds to their hurt feelings. The author is considering not attending the wedding and cutting off contact after.\n\nThe author's main argument is that since they're not in the wedding party and they're embarrassed, it's not worth the effort to attend. They also mention wanting to focus on friends who value their presence. \n\nOn one hand, weddings are significant events, and not attending might be seen as cutting someone off without trying to communicate. But on the other hand, the author feels slighted and is making a statement by not attending. \n\nI need to consider social norms. Typically, even if you're not in the wedding party, attending is expected for close friends. However, if the friendship has already drifted, maybe the author is right to prioritize friends who are more engaged. \n\nThe key points here are the expectation of being a bridesmaid vs. the reality. The author might feel betrayed, but maybe they should have discussed their feelings with the friend instead of assuming. The friend might have her reasons for choosing others, which the author didn't get to hear. \n\nAlso, the author mentions not staying in contact, which suggests they're ending the friendship. That could be a heavy move. But if they feel the friendship is one-sided, maybe it's justified. \n\nI think the author is in a tough spot. They might be overreacting by not attending the wedding without trying to talk to their friend first. But if the friendship is already strained, maybe their decision is valid. I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because attending a close friend's wedding is usually expected, and cutting off contact might be too harsh without communication. However, if the friendship was already drifting, it's understandable. But social expectations usually lean towards attending even if you're not in the wedding party. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
