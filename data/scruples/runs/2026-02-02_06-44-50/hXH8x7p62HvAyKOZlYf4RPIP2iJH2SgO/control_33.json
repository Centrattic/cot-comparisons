I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend didn't tell her about the wedding first and then she found out on Facebook. Then she assumed she would be the maid of honor because her friend was her maid of honor in her wedding two years ago. But when she found out that someone else was chosen for the maid of honor and she wasn't even in the wedding party, she felt hurt. Now she's considering not attending the wedding because she's hurt and doesn't want to go if she's not in the wedding party. She's not planning to stay in contact with her friend after this.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nWeddings are personal events, and the bride usually gets to choose who's in her wedding party. The fact that the friend didn't inform her first might be a point of contention. However, the author is now considering skipping the wedding because she's not in the wedding party. Is that justified?\n\nFrom a friendship perspective, the friend might have drifted apart. The user mentions that they've been friends for 15 years but drifted in the past few years. The bride might have chosen others who are closer now or who she wants to be in her wedding party. It's her right to do so.\n\nAttending a wedding is not something that's mandatory. Even if you're a close friend, people can choose to attend or not. However, some might argue that attending is a gesture of support regardless of whether you're in the wedding party. But others might say that if you're not part of the wedding party, maybe it's okay to skip, especially if there are financial and time commitments involved.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that she's hurt and doesn't want to be in a one-sided friendship. She plans to cut off contact. So, she's not attending out of hurt feelings and a decision to move on. Is that being in the wrong? Or is she justified in prioritizing her own feelings?\n\nAnother angle: The bride didn't communicate well. She found out via Facebook, which might be a red flag. The bride didn't explain why she didn't inform her first, which could have hurt the author's feelings. But the author's response is to not attend the wedding, which could be seen as a way to protect her own feelings.\n\nIn terms of social norms, attending a friend's wedding is often expected, but not required. If the author feels that the friendship is no longer reciprocal (since they've drifted apart and the friend didn't include her), then maybe it's understandable not to attend.\n\nBut some might argue that attending is a sign of respect, even if you're not in the wedding party. However, if the author is planning not to stay in contact, maybe she's prioritizing her own emotional well-being, which is her right.\n\nSo, putting this all together, is she in the wrong? I think the answer is B, No. She's not in the wrong because attending a wedding isn't mandatory, and she's choosing to protect her feelings given the circumstances. The bride made her choices, and the author is dealing with her hurt by making a decision that's best for her.\n"
