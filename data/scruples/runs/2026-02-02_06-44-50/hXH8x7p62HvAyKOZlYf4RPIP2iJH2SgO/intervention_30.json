I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a long-time friend getting married, and the author isn't part of the wedding party. The author is considering not attending because they're hurt and feel slighted.\n\nFirst, the author mentions being surprised when the friend found out via Facebook. The friend was supposed to tell them first, right? That might be a point of hurt. Then, the author assumed they'd be maid of honor because the friend was their maid of honor in their own wedding. But the friend chose someone else. The author still thought they'd be a bridesmaid, but apparently, even that didn't happen. The author is now thinking of not attending because they're not in the wedding party and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nHmm. So, weddings are big events, and while the author is upset, is it reasonable to not attend? Well, weddings are personal. The author might feel it's a slight not to be included in the wedding party, but the friend might have chosen her closest friends. The author's reasoning is that since they're not in the wedding party, attending isn't worth the effort. But is it the author's place to decide not to attend based on that?\n\nOn one hand, the author is hurt and wants to focus on friends who value them. On the other, maybe the friend didn't think to include them because their relationship has drifted. The author could have talked to the friend about their feelings instead of just deciding not to attend. However, the author isn't being asked to attend; they're choosing not to. But maybe they're punishing the friend for not being part of the wedding party, which is understandable but maybe not necessary.\n\nAlso, the author is planning to cut off contact after. Is that fair? Maybe the author is overreacting. Not attending a wedding because you're not in the wedding party is a big decision. Friends can drift apart, and maybe this is a natural consequence. But is the author in the wrong for not attending? It's a personal choice, but maybe the friend would be hurt if the author doesn't attend. However, the author's feelings are valid too.\n\nI think it's a tough call. The author hasn't broken any rules, but their decision might be based on hurt feelings. The question is whether they're wrong for not attending. If the author is choosing not to attend because they feel unvalued, it's a personal choice, but maybe it's better to attend for the friend's sake, even if hurt. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not attending. Answer A.\n"
