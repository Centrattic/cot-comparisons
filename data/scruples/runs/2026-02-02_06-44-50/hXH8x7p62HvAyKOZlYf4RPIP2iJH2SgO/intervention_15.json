I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The writer is a 15-year friend who got surprised by the friend's engagement on Facebook. They thought they'd be the maid of honor since the friend was their maid of honor two years ago. But then the friend chose another childhood friend as the maid of honor. The writer assumed they'd still be a bridesmaid but found out later that they weren't included in the wedding party at all. Now, the writer is considering not attending the wedding because they're hurt and don't want to attend if they're not part of the wedding party. They also mention they're not interested in a one-sided friendship and don't plan to stay in touch after this.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether it's wrong to not attend the wedding because they weren't asked to be in the wedding party. Let's break it down.\n\nWeddings are personal events, and the bride typically chooses who's in the wedding party based on various factors like closeness, current relationships, budget, etc. The writer acknowledges that the bride should have people she wants, so maybe they understand that. But the hurt comes from not being included, which is a common issue in friendships. \n\nThe writer is considering not attending because they feel it's not worth the effort and they don't want to be in a one-sided friendship. But is it reasonable to not attend a friend's wedding because of not being in the wedding party? Weddings are about celebrating the couple, not about the guests' roles. Not attending could be seen as punishing the friend for their choice, which might be a bit harsh. However, the writer is also not attending to avoid embarrassment and because they're hurt. \n\nOn the other hand, attending the wedding despite not being in the wedding party could be a sign of being a good friend. It shows support regardless of personal hurt. Not attending might make the friend feel further alienated. But the writer is choosing to cut ties, so maybe they feel this is a way to end the friendship on their own terms.\n\nThe key here is whether the writer has a valid reason to not attend. Since weddings are the couple's event, the bride isn't obligated to include everyone in the wedding party. The writer's decision to not attend because they weren't in the wedding party is a personal choice, but it's possible that others might see it as a bit self-centered, given that the wedding is still the bride's big day. However, if the writer feels it's a one-sided friendship and they can't move past this, maybe it's their way of setting a boundary. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the action is a petty punishment or a reasonable boundary. If the writer is cutting off the friendship, maybe they feel justified. But refusing to attend a wedding because you're not part of the wedding party might be seen as holding a grudge. However, if the writer is not attending for their own reasons (not wanting to spend money, not wanting to feel embarrassed), it's their choice. \n\nSo, the question is whether the writer is in the wrong. If the answer is A (Yes), it's because attending the wedding is expected as a close friend regardless of being in the wedding party. If it's B (No), then the writer's choice is understandable given the hurt and the decision to end the friendship. \n\nI think the community might lean towards A because attending a close friend's wedding is typically expected, even if you're not in the wedding party. The writer is making their attendance conditional on being in the wedding party, which could be seen as a petty response. But if they're ending the friendship, maybe they don't feel they have to attend. However, not attending could still be hurtful. \n\nAlternatively, since the writer is already cutting off contact, maybe their decision is a way to close the chapter. But I'm not sure if that's considered in the AITA context. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I'm a bit conflicted. The answer might be A if they think the writer is being petty, or B if they see it as a personal choice. Given the options, I need to decide between A and B.\n"
