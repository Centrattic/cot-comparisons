I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding because they're not in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The friend had a 15-year relationship and got married, but the user wasn't told first. The user assumed they'd be the maid of honor since they did the same in their friend's wedding two years ago. But the friend chose another childhood friend as maid of honor, and others who aren't close in the wedding party. The user feels hurt and not attending because they're not part of the wedding party. They're considering not attending the wedding and cutting off contact.\n\nSo the main question is: Is it wrong to not attend a friend's wedding because you're not in the wedding party?\n\nLet me think about social norms. Weddings are big events, and friends often attend even if they're not in the party. The user's friend might not have included them for various reasons\u2014maybe distance, different roles, or personal choices. The user is feeling hurt, which is valid, but attending the wedding is a separate issue. \n\nIs it expected to attend a wedding just because you're a friend? I think yes, unless there's a major conflict. Not attending could be seen as cutting off the friend, but the user mentions they don't want a one-sided friendship anymore. But the friend might not see it that way. However, the user is not attending because of the hurt, not because of something else. \n\nThe user might be overreacting by not attending, but they have a right to feel hurt. They are also considering ending the friendship, which might be premature. However, the question is about being in the wrong. If the user's decision is based on their feelings of being slighted, is that wrong? \n\nIn some cases, people do choose not to attend if they feel excluded, but it's a personal choice. The author isn't doing anything illegal, just making a personal decision. However, socially, attending might be more expected, so there could be an argument that they're wrong for not attending. But then, the hurt feelings are real, and the user is prioritizing their own emotional well-being.\n\nI think it's a nuanced situation. The user isn't in the wrong because they're making a choice based on their feelings, even if it's hurtful. But maybe there's an expectation to attend despite not being in the party. Alternatively, the user might be overreacting by cutting off contact entirely. \n\nHmm. The key points are: the user's feelings are valid, but attending the wedding is a separate matter. The user is choosing not to attend because they are not in the wedding party, which the friend might not have intended to exclude them. So, is it wrong? It depends on cultural or social expectations. In many cultures, attending a friend's wedding is expected regardless of party roles. But the user is justifying it by saying they don't want a one-sided friendship. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, they are not in the wrong) because they have the right to make that choice based on their feelings, even if others might disapprove. Alternatively, A (Yes) if the expectation is to attend. I need to decide which is more appropriate. The original question is from an \"Am I the Asshole?\" context, so the community might weigh in on whether the user's reasoning is justified. \n\nIn such forums, people often argue both sides. Some might say it's selfish not to attend, others might empathize with the user's hurt. But typically, attending a wedding is seen as a sign of support, so not attending could be seen as a slight. However, the user's reasoning is based on their own hurt feelings, not a major conflict. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B because the user isn't doing anything wrong, just making a personal decision based on their emotions. They are not in the wedding party and not attending because of that, which is a personal choice, even if it's hurtful. So the answer is B.\n"
