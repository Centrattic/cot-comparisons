I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't included in the wedding party. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author is a 15-year friend who was surprised by the friend getting engaged on Facebook. They thought they'd be the maid of honor since their friend was in that role at their wedding. The friend ended up choosing someone else, and the author feels hurt. Now, the author is considering skipping the wedding because they're not in the wedding party.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the friend didn't inform them first, they were expecting to be in the wedding party, and they're choosing not to attend. The question is whether this is wrong.\n\nWeddings are significant events, and attending is often considered a social expectation unless there's a good reason not to. But in this case, the author feels slighted. Should they still go? Well, the author's feelings are valid\u2014they felt ignored when finding out on social media and then not being chosen for the wedding party. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of being a friend. Even if you're not in the wedding party, attending is a way to support the friend. However, the author feels the friendship is one-sided now and plans to cut contact. If that's the case, maybe they're not in the wrong for wanting to move on. \n\nBut skipping a wedding can be seen as a major snub. However, the author isn't cutting ties entirely; they're just not attending due to hurt feelings. The friend might not have communicated well, but the author's decision to not go might be a way to protect their own feelings.\n\nIn some cultures, attending a friend's wedding is expected regardless of your role. But if the friendship has drifted, maybe the author isn't responsible for the friend's decisions. They have a right to prioritize their own well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should attend to maintain the friendship, but if they're already planning to let it go, then maybe not attending is a way to end it gracefully. \n\nI think the key here is whether attending is a personal choice based on their current relationship status. If the author feels the friendship isn't reciprocal, they aren't obligated to attend. So maybe the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
