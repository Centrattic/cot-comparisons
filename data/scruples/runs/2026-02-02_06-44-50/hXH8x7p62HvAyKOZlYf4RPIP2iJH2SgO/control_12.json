I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author has been friends with someone for over 15 years. When her friend got engaged, the author found out via Facebook, which surprised her because she expected to be told first. She sent a message and they talked about wedding plans, and the author assumed she'd be the maid of honor since her friend was her maid of honor two years ago.\n\nBut then the friend chose another childhood best friend as the maid of honor. The author was hurt but understood they'd drifted apart. Still, she thought she'd be a bridesmaid. However, the friend included other people in the wedding party who aren't very close. The author feels hurt and is considering not attending the wedding because she's not in the wedding party, even though it's not a huge financial burden. She's planning to cut off contact after this. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not attending.\n\nSo, first, is it the author's responsibility to attend? Weddings are big events, but they're also personal. The friend didn't include her in the wedding party, which is a big snub. The author might feel unappreciated. However, attending a friend's wedding is traditionally expected, even if you're not in the party. But maybe the author's hurt feelings are valid because she thought she was close enough to be included. The friend finding out via Facebook is also a point\u2014maybe the friend didn't prioritize the author's feelings. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that she doesn't want to attend if she's not in the party because it's a one-sided friendship. But weddings are usually for important people, and not attending might be seen as cutting off the friend. However, the author's feelings of being snubbed and drifting apart might justify her decision. \n\nI need to consider cultural norms. In many places, attending a friend's wedding is expected even if you're not in the party, unless there are extenuating circumstances. The author is making a choice based on her feelings. But maybe she's overreacting because the friend chose someone else. On the other hand, the friend didn't tell her first and didn't include her, which is hurtful. The author's decision not to attend might be hurtful to the friend, but she's also protecting her own emotions. \n\nIs she in the wrong? If the friend is the one who didn't include her, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The friend's actions might be the issue. The author is choosing to prioritize her own feelings, which is understandable. So maybe the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
