I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't chosen as a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, the friend was surprised she wasn't the maid of honor, even though her friend was the maid of honor at her wedding two years ago. They've been friends for 15 years but have drifted apart. The author found out about the wedding through Facebook and later discovered her friend chose someone else as maid of honor. Now she's not in the wedding party at all. She's considering not attending because she's hurt and doesn't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since she's not in the wedding party, it's not worth the effort and money to attend. She also doesn't plan to stay in contact after the wedding. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider social norms and expectations. Traditionally, attending a friend's wedding is seen as important, especially for close friends, even if you're not part of the wedding party. The fact that they've known each other for 15 years might imply a level of closeness that expects attendance regardless of being in the party. However, the author feels slighted because she wasn't invited to the wedding party, which is a significant role. \n\nFriendship expectations can vary. Some might say that being in the wedding party is an honor, and not being chosen doesn't negate the importance of attending. Others might empathize with the author's hurt feelings and her decision to prioritize her own emotional well-being. However, not attending could be seen as cutting off contact or not supporting a long-time friend, which could be viewed as inconsiderate.\n\nThe author's decision to not attend might be seen as a reaction to feeling excluded, but the wedding is a happy event for the friend. Not attending because of personal hurt feelings could be perceived as selfish, especially if the friend didn't know the author was upset. The author's plan to not stay in contact after also suggests that the friendship is already strained, but the act of attending the wedding could be a way to maintain a positive send-off.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong if her decision to not attend is based more on spite than a legitimate reason. However, if she genuinely feels the friendship is one-sided and the cost is a factor, some might side with her. But traditionally, attending weddings is expected, so not attending might be seen as a breach of social norms.\n"
