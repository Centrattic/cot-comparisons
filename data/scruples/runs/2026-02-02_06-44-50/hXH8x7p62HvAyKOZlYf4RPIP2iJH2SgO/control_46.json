I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't chosen as a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The writer is a 15-year friend of the bride. They were surprised when they found out about the wedding on Facebook, expecting to be told first. They assumed they would be the maid of honor since the friend was their maid of honor in their own wedding. But the bride chose another childhood best friend as maid of honor, and the writer isn't in the wedding party. Now, the writer is considering not attending, as they feel hurt and don't want to go as a guest. They also mention they don't want a one-sided friendship and plan to cut ties after this.\n\nThe key factors here are the writer's feelings versus the expectations of attending a friend's wedding. In many cultures, attending a close friend's wedding is considered important, especially after 15 years of friendship. However, the writer is justified in feeling hurt and not wanting to attend if they feel unappreciated. The bride didn't communicate well, finding out on social media is a red flag, and the writer's feelings are valid. The decision to not attend is a personal choice, but they might be expected to go despite the hurt. However, since the friendship is already drifting, the writer might be right to prioritize their own feelings. So, am I in the wrong (AITA)? The answer depends on cultural norms and personal values. But since the writer is making a choice based on their feelings and the friendship's state, they might not be in the wrong.\n"
