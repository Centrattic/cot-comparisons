We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law after an incident six years ago. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple built a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, questioned the doneness of her meat, then later complained about the food being terrible and said she had to grill it herself. The husband was upset, tried to get an apology, but she didn't. The author then stopped cooking for the MIL for years.\n\nNow, the author is being asked if they're in the wrong for holding onto this grudge. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. The key points here are the MIL's actions and the author's response. The MIL's behavior sounds pretty harsh. She criticized the food in front of others, didn't apologize, and the husband was hurt. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which has lasted six years. \n\nThe user is wondering if holding a grudge for such a long time is unreasonable. The author mentions that no one else had issues with the food, which makes the MIL's complaint stand out. Also, the author has a good relationship with the MIL otherwise. \n\nI need to consider if the author's reaction is justified. The MIL's actions were hurtful, and the author's decision to stop cooking as a form of self-preservation or standing up for their standards might be seen as reasonable. However, holding onto this for six years could be seen as not moving on, especially if it's affecting the relationship. \n\nBut the author is also standing by their decision because they were wronged. The MIL didn't apologize, so the author might feel justified in maintaining distance. Also, the husband wants to move on, but the author is resisting, possibly because they still feel the sting of the criticism. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is being stubborn and that the MIL's actions, while hurtful, shouldn't overshadow their relationship. The author's not cooking isn't hurting anyone else, but maybe it's causing strain in the marriage. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's actions are a reasonable response to being treated poorly without apology, then maybe not in the wrong. But if holding a grudge for six years is excessive, then maybe they are. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's response is proportionate. Since the MIL was unapologetic, the author's decision to set boundaries might be valid. Also, the author isn't cutting off the MIL entirely but choosing not to cook, which is a personal choice. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I'm a bit torn because the time span is long. However, the original incident was pretty hurtful, so maybe it's justified.\n"
