We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a person holding a grudge against their mother-in-law (MIL) for an incident that happened years ago. The key points are:\n\nFirst, the MIL didn't eat the meat at a cookout, asked her husband if it was cooked enough, and then re-cooked it. The author's husband was upset when the MIL later criticized the food, leading the author to vow never to cook for them again. Now, the husband wants to move on, and the author is considering whether they should cook for them again, like at Easter.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving and continuing this vow. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The MIL's actions: she didn't eat the meat, maybe because she didn't like how it was cooked. She did ask her husband about it, and he said it was okay. But then she decided to cook it more herself. That might have been a bit rude or passive-aggressive, but maybe not a huge deal. However, the real issue is that the MIL later went to the husband and criticized the food, which caused him emotional distress. The author then decides not to cook for them as a result.\n\nThe author's perspective: They feel justified because the MIL's criticism was unwarranted, especially since no one else had issues. The vow has lasted 6 years. The husband wants to move past it. The author is conflicted and wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nNow, evaluating from an ethical standpoint. Holding a grudge for 6 years seems excessive. The author is punishing the MIL for a past action by not cooking for them, which might not be fair. The MIL's actions, while possibly hurtful (especially the criticism), might not justify such a long-held resentment. Also, the author mentions that their relationship with the MIL is otherwise good, so maybe the author is overreacting. On the other hand, the MIL's behavior was indeed hurtful towards the husband, and the author's reaction is a way to set boundaries.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If forgiveness is expected, then maybe. However, forgiveness is a personal choice. The author isn't hurting anyone else by not cooking; the MIL might not even notice. The key is whether the author's action is unjustified. If the author's decision is based on justified hurt and setting boundaries, then maybe not in the wrong. But if holding a grudge for so long is seen as excessive, then maybe A.\n\nBut in the context of the community's typical responses to these \"Am I the Asshole?\" posts, often people are encouraged to forgive and move on, especially if there's no ongoing harm. The author isn't causing harm here; they're just not cooking. However, the husband's feelings are involved, and the author is avoiding a potential conflict. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong because they have a valid reason to be hurt and it's their choice to set boundaries. But some might argue that holding a grudge for 6 years is too long. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards B because the author's actions are a personal boundary and not causing harm.\n"
