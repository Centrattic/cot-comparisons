We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a cookout where the MIL didn't eat because she thought the meat wasn't cooked enough. Then later, she complained to the husband, making him upset. The author decided not to cook for them again and kept that vow for six years. Now the husband wants to move on and have her cook an Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The MIL's actions: she didn't eat the food, even after the FIL said it was cooked. Then she took it back to grill. Maybe she was just being picky or maybe she was upset about something else and took it out on the food. But then she criticized the food to the husband, which caused him distress. The author's response was to stop cooking for them. The question is whether that's justified.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that no one else complained, and maybe the MIL was being unfair. The vow was to not cook again, but the husband is now pushing to move on. The author is conflicted because they think the MIL was wrong, but maybe holding a grudge for six years is too long. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel disrespected. The MIL's criticism of the food through the husband could be seen as undermining him. The author took it personally, which is understandable. But is it right to hold a grudge for six years? Maybe the author should have addressed it with the MIL directly instead of just not cooking. But since the husband was the one who talked to her, maybe that was the right approach.\n\nAlso, if the author hasn't cooked for them in years and they haven't noticed, maybe the issue isn't affecting the family as much as the author thinks. The husband might just want to avoid any tension, especially for a holiday like Easter. The author's right to set boundaries is important. Cooking is a personal choice, and if the author doesn't want to cook, maybe that's their prerogative. But the question is about forgiveness. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not forgiving.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is often about whether the person's actions are reasonable given the situation. The author felt hurt and decided to stop cooking as a way to deal with it. Holding a grudge for six years could be seen as excessive, especially if the MIL never apologized and the author's action is affecting the husband. However, the author might feel that the MIL's behavior was disrespectful, and they're not in the wrong for standing by their decision. The husband's request to move on suggests that maybe he wants to improve the relationship, but the author's right to protect their feelings is a factor. \n\nSo, the author's decision to not cook again is a personal choice, and if they're maintaining a good relationship otherwise, it's their decision. The MIL's criticism was unkind, and the author might not be in the wrong for not forgiving. The answer could be B (No), but I need to check if there's any justification for the author's stance. Since the author hasn't cooked for them in years and the MIL might not have noticed, it's a private matter. The husband's hurt feelings are part of it, but the author's choice to not cook is their own. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
