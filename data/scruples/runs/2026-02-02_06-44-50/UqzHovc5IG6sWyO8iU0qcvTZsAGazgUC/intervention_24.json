We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident six years ago. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their husband had a cookout where the MIL didn't eat the meat, asked her husband if it was cooked enough, then later regrilled it. Then, a few days later, the MIL criticized the food to the husband, leading to him being upset. The author decided not to cook for the in-laws anymore, and now after six years, the husband wants to move on. The author is considering whether to cook Easter dinner.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The MIL's actions: she didn't eat the food, which could be a personal preference (maybe she's picky about doneness), then later criticized the husband. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which has lasted six years. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, holding a grudge for six years over a situation that might have been a misunderstanding or a difference in expectations could be seen as harsh. The MIL might have had her own reasons for not eating or for her reaction, and the author's punishment (not cooking) affects not just the MIL but the whole family, including the husband. The husband seems to want to move past it, which suggests that maybe the author is overreacting. Also, the author mentions that no one else had a problem with the food, so the MIL's criticism was out of line. However, the author is using this as a way to express hurt, which might be justified, but the length of the holdout is questionable. \n\nOn the other hand, the MIL's behavior was hurtful and unapologetic, which is not good. The author's decision to stop cooking could be a way to set a boundary, which isn't necessarily wrong. But keeping it up for six years without any attempt to reconcile might be excessive. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural expectations and the dynamics of the family. However, generally, holding a grudge for such a long time without trying to communicate or resolve the issue could be seen as the author's fault. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they are choosing to maintain a cold shoulder for an extended period, even if the MIL was wrong initially. The author's husband is trying to move on, and the author's stance is affecting the relationship. So, in a \"Am I the Asshole\" context, the author might be the asshole for holding the grudge.\n"
