We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, leading to the author's vow to never cook for them again. The husband now wants to move past it, but the author is hesitant.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The author's MIL found the meat not cooked enough, which led to her grilling it again. But then, a few days later, she criticized the food at the cookout, which upset the husband. The author then decided to stop cooking for them, which they've kept up for six years. Now the husband wants to move on, and the author is considering whether to comply, especially for Easter dinner.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that they think the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think. The possible answers are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nLet me consider the moral aspects here. The author's MIL's actions were inappropriate\u2014criticizing the food after the event and then confronting the husband. The author's reaction was to stop cooking for them, which has lasted years. Now the husband is advocating for forgiveness and moving past it. The author is conflicted because they feel justified but are being asked to let it go.\n\nFrom a perspective of forgiveness and maintaining family relationships, holding a grudge for six years over an event that might have been a minor misunderstanding could be seen as excessive. The author's decision to stop cooking might be more about punishing the MIL than addressing the actual issue. The MIL's behavior was rude, but the author's punishment has lasted far longer than necessary. Also, the husband is caught in the middle, wanting to mend the relationship. The author might be in the wrong for not letting go and for using cooking as a form of retribution. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue that the MIL's actions were hurtful and that they deserve to set boundaries. However, after six years, it's reasonable to reassess and consider reconciliation. The fact that the author hasn't cooked for them in years and the family might not even notice suggests that the punishment isn't affecting the MIL but is instead affecting the author's own relationship with their husband. \n\nSo, weighing the arguments, the author's long-held grudge and refusal to move past it, despite the husband's desire for reconciliation, might make them the one at fault here. The answer would be A.\n"
