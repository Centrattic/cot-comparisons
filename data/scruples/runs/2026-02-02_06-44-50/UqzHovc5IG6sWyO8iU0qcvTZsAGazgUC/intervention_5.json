We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a family cookout where the MIL didn't like the food and later complained to the husband. The author decided not to cook for the in-laws anymore as a result, and now the husband wants them to move on and cook Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The MIL found the meat undercooked, asked her husband, then cooked it herself. Then a few days later, she went to the husband's work and criticized the food, even after the author had already decided not to cook for them. The husband was upset and tried to get an apology but didn't get one. The author hasn't cooked for them in six years, and the husband is pushing to move on now.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since no one else had a problem with the food, the MIL's complaint was especially harsh and unnecessary. They feel justified in holding a grudge because the MIL didn't apologize and kept being critical. The question is whether holding this grudge for six years is wrong.\n\nOn one hand, holding a grudge for such a long time might be seen as excessive, especially if the MIL's actions were a one-time issue. The author's vow not to cook for them could be seen as a personal choice, but the husband is now asking them to move past it. The author also mentions that the in-laws might not even notice the change, so there's no current harm. However, the author's decision might be causing tension in the marriage if the husband is upset about it.\n\nOn the other hand, the MIL's behavior was arguably inconsiderate. She not only criticized the food in front of others but also went to the husband's work to complain. The husband was hurt, and the author's response was to stop cooking for them. If the author is protecting their own feelings and boundaries, maybe it's understandable. But keeping a six-year grudge could be seen as holding onto resentment unnecessarily, especially if the relationship with the in-laws is otherwise good.\n\nI think the key factors here are the length of the grudge, the impact on the marriage, and whether the author's actions are proportionate. The author's choice to stop cooking is a personal boundary, but refusing to cook for a family event like Easter might affect the husband's relationship with his parents. Since the author is okay with the husband cooking but he can't, maybe the husband feels the need for the author to compromise. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit gray. The MIL's behavior was poor, but holding onto it for years could be seen as the author not letting go. However, the author isn't in the wrong necessarily because they are setting boundaries. But maybe the longer time frame makes it harder to justify, so the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A). However, since they have a good relationship otherwise, maybe not. It's a bit tricky. I might go with A because holding a grudge that long could be seen as unkind, even if the initial issue was the MIL's fault.\n"
