We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law. The situation involves a past incident where the MIL criticized the food at a cookout, leading the author to stop cooking for them. The husband now wants to move on, and the author is considering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The MIL found the meat undercooked, asked her husband, grilled it herself, and later criticized the food, making the husband upset. The author vowed not to cook for them again, which they've kept for six years. The husband is pushing to move past it, and they're wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issues here are forgiveness, holding a grudge, and the impact on the relationship. The author is using the MIL's criticism as a reason to avoid cooking, but the question is whether that's justified. \n\nOn one hand, the MIL's behavior was inconsiderate, especially taking the husband aside to criticize the food and not apologizing. That could be hurtful. The husband was upset, which shows the emotional impact. However, the author has held this grudge for six years. That's a long time. The husband is now trying to move on, which is understandable. Relationships require compromise and forgiveness. If the author is holding onto this out of spite or as a form of punishment, that might not be healthy.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that no one else had a problem with the food, which might indicate the MIL was overly critical. But the author's decision to stop cooking could be seen as a passive-aggressive response. While the MIL's actions were wrong, the author's prolonged refusal to cook might be an overreaction. The author says they don't think the MIL has noticed, implying that the resentment is one-sided. Continuing this grudge could affect the family dynamics, especially since the husband is trying to reconcile.\n\nIn AITA situations, the key is balance. The MIL was wrong to criticize without apology, but the author's long-term refusal to cook might be unnecessary. The husband's well-being and the family's harmony are also factors. The author might need to reassess if holding onto this grudge is helping or just causing more issues. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for not letting go after so long.\n"
