We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) over an incident from six years ago.\n\nSo the situation is that the author and their husband built a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked the FIL if it was cooked enough, he said yes, then she took it back to grill more. Later, the in-laws came to the husband's work, and the MIL criticized the food, leading the husband to get upset. The author decided not to cook for them anymore, and now the husband wants to move on, suggesting cooking Easter dinner again. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong for holding onto this grudge.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The MIL didn't eat the food and later criticized it, even after the husband addressed it. The author stopped cooking for them as a result. Now, the husband is pushing for reconciliation, and the author is conflicted.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is at fault. From the story, the author's action was to stop cooking as a form of punishment or to express hurt. The MIL's behavior was inappropriate and hurtful, especially coming after the event and in a private setting where she took the opportunity to criticize. The author's response seems to be a personal reaction to being blamed unjustly. \n\nThe author mentions that no one else had a problem with the food, so it wasn't a general issue. The MIL's actions were specific and led to the husband being upset. The author's vow to never cook again might be extreme, but it's a personal choice. The husband's perspective is that it's time to move on, but the author is considering that the in-laws might not even notice the change. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the MIL was clearly in the wrong by criticizing the food and making their son feel bad. The author's response is a way to protect themselves and their family. However, holding a grudge for six years could be seen as the author's issue. But given the context, the author isn't necessarily at fault for being hurt and choosing to set boundaries. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving. \n\nSince the author's action is about their own feelings and setting boundaries, and the MIL didn't apologize, it's a complex situation. The author isn't obligated to cook for them if they feel it's a matter of pride or hurt. The husband's desire to move on is valid, but the author's choice isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nThe answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're justified in their feelings, especially since the MIL didn't apologize and the criticism was unkind. The author isn't obligated to cook for them again if they feel it's not worth the emotional toll. However, the author might consider if holding this grudge is affecting their relationship with the husband. But based solely on the given info, their choice isn't wrong.\n"
