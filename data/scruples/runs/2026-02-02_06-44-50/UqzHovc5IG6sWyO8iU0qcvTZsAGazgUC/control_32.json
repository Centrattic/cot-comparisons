We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law after an incident six years ago.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their husband built a patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked her husband if it was cooked, then later grilling it herself. Then, the MIL criticized the food and told her son it was awful, which upset him. The author decided not to cook for them anymore and has kept that vow for six years. The husband wants to move on, and the author is considering whether to make Easter dinner.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I should consider the key points. The MIL's actions: she didn't eat the food, which might have been due to personal preference (like preferring well-done meat). She then criticized the food, which hurt her son's feelings. The author's response was to stop cooking for them as a result. \n\nIs the author justified? Well, the MIL's behavior was unkind and hurtful, especially public criticism. The author's punishment is cutting off cooking, which affects the MIL and FIL's experience but not their relationship overall. The author mentions that the rest of the relationship is good. \n\nHowever, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as extreme. The author's husband is trying to move on, and the author is being asked to cook again. The question is whether the author's stance is reasonable. Since the MIL didn't apologize and the author felt wronged, it's a personal choice. But the author is affecting their in-laws' experience without their in-laws' awareness. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the general approach is to consider if the author's actions are proportionate. The author's punishment (not cooking) is a personal choice, and if they don't want to cook, that's their right. But if the husband is pressuring them, maybe the author should consider reconciliation. However, the MIL hasn't apologized, so the author might feel justified. \n\nSo, based on this, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author has a valid reason and the MIL's actions were at fault. The author is choosing to set boundaries, which is their right. The answer is B.\n"
