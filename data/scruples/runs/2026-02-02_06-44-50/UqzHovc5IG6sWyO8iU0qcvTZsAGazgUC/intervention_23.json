We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a past incident where the MIL criticized the food at a cookout, leading the author to vow never to cook for them again. Now, the husband is pushing for reconciliation, and the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's MIL didn't eat the food, then later criticized it when someone else (FIL) said it was cooked enough. She ended up re-grilling it and later criticized the food to the husband, which upset him. The author decided not to cook for them anymore, and it's been six years. The husband wants to move on, but the author is hesitant.\n\nSo, the main question is about forgiveness and whether holding a grudge for six years is justified. The author argues that no one else had issues with the food except the MIL, and maybe the in-laws haven't even noticed the change. The author also mentions that other than this, the relationship is good.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, holding a grudge for such a long time could be seen as unforgiving, especially if the MIL's actions were a one-time event. However, the MIL's behavior might have been hurtful and disrespectful, which could justify the author's stance. The husband's perspective is that it's time to let go, which suggests that he might be prioritizing family harmony.\n\nBut the author's vow not to cook for them again is a personal choice. They are not cooking, but the husband can. The author might feel justified in their actions. However, if this is causing ongoing tension in the marriage, it could be seen as the author being in the wrong for not letting go, especially if the MIL's actions were a past incident with no further issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the MIL's behavior was inconsiderate. She publicly re-grilled the food and then criticized the host, which is a breach of etiquette. The author's refusal to cook could be a form of self-respect, maintaining boundaries. If the MIL hasn't apologized, it's possible the author is protecting their own feelings.\n\nSo, the balance here is between forgiveness and respecting personal boundaries. If the author feels that their boundaries are important and the MIL hasn't shown any remorse, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, holding onto a grudge for six years without reconciliation could be seen as overly harsh, especially if it's affecting the marriage. The husband's role here is also important; he might be mediating between his wife's feelings and his parents' actions.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, forgiveness is often encouraged, but it's also important to consider the validity of the original grievance. The author isn't causing harm by not cooking, but they might be avoiding a potential reconciliation. The answer might depend on whether the author's choice is about holding a grudge or setting healthy boundaries.\n"
