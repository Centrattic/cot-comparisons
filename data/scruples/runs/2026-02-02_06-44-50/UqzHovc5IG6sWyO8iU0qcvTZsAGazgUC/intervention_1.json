We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident six years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL didn't eat the food, grilling it herself later, and then criticizing it to the husband. The author decided not to cook for them anymore and is now being asked by the husband to move on.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The patio cookout was a family event where the author and their husband prepared the food. The MIL didn't eat it, questioned the doneness, and then later grilled the meat herself, implying it wasn't done properly. Then, a few days later, she criticized the food to the husband, making him upset. The author stopped cooking for them as a result.\n\nNow, the question is whether holding a grudge for six years is justified. The key points here are the severity of the incident and the author's reaction. The MIL's actions were unkind and possibly embarrassing, but they happened in the past. The author hasn't cooked for them since, but the husband is now asking to cook Easter dinner. The author is considering if they should move on, even though the MIL might not have noticed the change.\n\nFactors to consider: The author's decision is based on hurt feelings from a past event. However, it's been six years, and they otherwise have a good relationship. The author's husband is trying to reconcile, and the author is willing to let him cook. The author's stance might be seen as holding onto a grudge for too long, especially if the MIL hasn't followed up or apologized. On the other hand, the MIL's initial behavior was passive-aggressive, taking it upon herself to regrill the food and then criticizing the effort. The author's vow to stop cooking could be a coping mechanism but might affect the relationship with the in-laws.\n\nIn such situations, forgiveness and moving on are often considered mature responses. The author's reaction might be reasonable to protect their own feelings, but holding it for six years could be seen as excessive. The MIL's actions were unkind, but the author's punishment of not cooking for them has lasted much longer than the incident. Since the author says the in-laws haven't noticed the change, it's possible the author is more affected than the in-laws are.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for feeling hurt initially, but holding onto the grudge for six years without reconciliation might make them the antagonist here. The husband is trying to make peace, and the author's refusal to cook for Easter could be seen as unnecessary. The answer would depend on whether the author's actions are proportionate to the original offense. Since the MIL's mistake was a one-time event and the author is still punishing them, it's likely the author is in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
