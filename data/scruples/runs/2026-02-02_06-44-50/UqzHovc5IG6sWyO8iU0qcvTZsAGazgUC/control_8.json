We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a conflict between the author (the daughter-in-law) and her mother-in-law (MIL). The key points here are the incident at the cookout and the subsequent refusal to cook for the MIL for six years.\n\nFirst, the cookout incident: the MIL didn't eat the meat, had it re-cooked, and later criticized the food, leading to the husband being upset. The author decided not to cook for them anymore. Now the husband wants to move on, but the author is holding onto this grudge.\n\nI need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The main factors here are the initial conflict and the length of the grudge. The MIL's behavior was unkind and publicly critical, which can be hurtful. The author's response was to stop cooking, which is a personal choice. However, holding a grudge for six years might be excessive. \n\nBut the husband is pushing to move on, and the author is considering it. The question is whether the author's stance is justified. The MIL's actions were disrespectful, but the author's punishment is not reciprocating a social gesture (cooking). If the author is willing to have a good relationship otherwise, maybe it's time to let go. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't causing harm; the MIL might not even notice. But relationships require forgiveness and moving past issues. The author might be right in not wanting to let it go if the MIL hasn't apologized. But holding onto it for six years could be seen as the author's fault for not letting go. \n\nSo the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because holding a grudge for such a long time, especially when the other party hasn't apologized, might be unreasonable. But some might argue that the MIL's behavior was worse. The key is the duration and the impact on the relationship. Since the author has a good relationship otherwise, maybe it's time to forgive. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
