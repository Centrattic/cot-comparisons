We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's mother-in-law (MIL) criticized the food at a cookout, even though no one else had a problem with it. The MIL ended up re-cooking the meat herself. Then, she later told the author's husband the food was terrible, which upset him. The author decided not to cook for the in-laws anymore, keeping this vow for six years. Now, the husband wants to move on, and the author is conflicted about cooking Easter dinner.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take. Let's consider the key points.\n\n1. **MIL's Actions**: The MIL was critical and passive-aggressive. She didn't just mention the meat was undercooked; she later criticized the entire meal, leading to her son's emotional distress. That's pretty harsh, especially since others didn't have issues. It seems like she overreacted and took it personally, which isn't fair to the author or the husband.\n\n2. **Author's Response**: The author stopped cooking for the in-laws as a result. This has been a six-year grudge. The author's reasoning is that the MIL's criticism was unkind and unnecessary. From the author's perspective, it was a betrayal and disrespect, so holding onto that anger makes sense. However, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive, especially if the relationship with the MIL is otherwise good.\n\n3. **Husband's Perspective**: The husband is urging to move on, and he's the one who tried to address the issue with his mom. The author is being asked to make a gesture (cooking Easter dinner) for the sake of family harmony. The author's not cooking might be isolating the in-laws, but the author argues that the in-laws haven't noticed.\n\n4. **Moral of the Story**: Is it wrong to hold onto a grudge over this? It depends on context. If the MIL has shown no remorse and the author still feels hurt, maybe it's justified. But maintaining a six-year grudge without any effort to reconcile might be seen as the author's issue, not the MIL's. However, the initial criticism was clearly the MIL's fault, so the author's response is a reaction to that.\n\n5. **Communication and Forgiveness**: The author hasn't communicated with the MIL about this; they've just avoided cooking. Forgiveness is a personal choice, and if the author feels they can't forgive, that's their right. However, the husband's relationship with his parents is also a factor here. The author is being asked to prioritize family unity, which is valid, but only if the author is willing.\n\n6. **Practical Considerations**: The author says they have a good relationship otherwise. If the author chooses to cook for Easter, it might be a step towards letting go, but if they can't, it's not necessarily in the wrong. The in-laws not noticing the change might mean the author's actions aren't causing harm, but the author is still holding resentment.\n\nIn summary, the MIL was clearly at fault with her harsh criticism. The author's reaction is a response to that. While holding a grudge for six years is long, it's a personal decision. The author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to forgive, especially if the MIL hasn't apologized. The key is whether the author is harming the family dynamic by not cooking. If the in-laws aren't harmed and the author's relationship with them is good otherwise, then the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
