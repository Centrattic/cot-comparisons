We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a past incident where the MIL criticized the food at a cookout and later confronted the husband about it. The author has since vowed not to cook for them anymore, and the husband wants to move on.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The MIL's actions: she didn't eat the meat, asked her husband if it was cooked, then took it back to grill. Then she later told the husband the food was terrible, leading to him being upset. The author stopped cooking for them as a result. The question is whether holding this grudge for six years is justified.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is at fault (answer A) or not (answer B). The answer should be based on whether the author's actions (refusing to cook) are reasonable given the MIL's behavior.\n\nFactors to consider: The MIL's criticism was harsh and public, leading to emotional harm. The author's vow is a personal boundary, which might be justified. However, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive. The husband wants reconciliation, and the author is being asked to forgive. Also, the author mentions that the MIL might not have noticed the change, implying the grudge isn't causing current issues. However, maintaining family harmony is often valued.\n\nBut the MIL's actions were inconsiderate and hurtful. The author's response is a form of self-respect and standing up for their efforts. In some perspectives, the author is protecting their feelings. However, others might argue that holding onto the issue for so long isn't healthy. The story seems to lean towards the author not being in the wrong because the MIL's actions were the initial problem. The author's choice to set boundaries is valid. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
