We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident involving a cookout.\n\nFirst, the context: The couple built a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked the FIL if it was cooked enough, he said it was, she put it down, then took it back to grill more. A few days later, the MIL criticized the food to the husband, leading him to be upset and the wife to stop cooking for them. Now the husband wants to move on, but the wife is still holding a grudge after six years.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the wife is wrong for not forgiving her MIL for that comment. Let's break it down. The wife is upset because the criticism was unkind and came after the event. The husband is trying to move past it, but she's holding onto it. \n\nI need to consider cultural norms and typical family dynamics. In many cases, holding a grudge for such a long time is seen as negative, especially if the other person hasn't apologized. However, the wife's actions (not cooking anymore) are a personal choice. The MIL's behavior was inconsiderate, but maybe the wife's response is excessive? \n\nAlso, the wife mentions that no one else had a problem with the food, so the MIL's criticism was out of line. The husband was hurt, but the wife took it further by vowing not to cook again. Is that justified? Maybe she's protecting her feelings, but after six years, it's possible that the issue has been resolved in other aspects. The wife still has a good relationship otherwise, so maybe the grudge isn't necessary. \n\nHowever, the MIL didn't apologize, so the wife might feel wronged. The key here is whether the wife is in the wrong for not forgiving. If the MIL was ungrateful and the wife is choosing to not cook as a form of self-respect, maybe she's not the asshole. But holding a grudge for six years could be seen as stubborn. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the husband is right to want to move on. The wife's decision to not cook is her prerogative, but the question is about being in the wrong. The MIL's actions were rude, so the wife isn't necessarily wrong for being upset. If the wife is choosing not to cook to avoid the situation, that's her choice. \n\nBut does it matter if the MIL hasn't noticed? The wife isn't making amends, but if it's a personal vow to not cook for them, perhaps that's her right. The husband is trying to reconcile, but the wife might be justified in her stance. \n\nHmm. The answer would likely be B (No), because the wife is reacting to a specific hurt and has a right to set boundaries. The MIL's behavior was unkind, so the wife isn't in the wrong for not forgiving her, especially if she's maintaining her own well-being. The husband's desire to move on is good, but the wife isn't obligated to cook if she's still upset.\n"
