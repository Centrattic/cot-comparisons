We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, leading to the author vowing not to cook for them again for six years. The husband now wants to move on, and the author is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked her husband about it, then later criticized the author's cooking. The author hasn't cooked for them since, even though their relationship is otherwise good. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is checking for opinions.\n\nFactors to consider: The MIL's actions were hurtful and inappropriate. Public criticism can damage relationships. The author's vow is a long time (6 years). The husband is caught in the middle. The author's reasoning is that no one else had an issue, so the criticism was unwarranted.\n\nIs the author justified? Well, holding a grudge for six years might be excessive, even if the MIL was wrong. The author's decision to cut off cooking could be seen as a passive-aggressive response. However, the MIL's behavior was clearly inappropriate. The author might feel that their effort was unappreciated and criticized unfairly.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. The question is about forgiveness. The author hasn't forgiven the MIL, and the husband is encouraging forgiveness. The community might weigh in on whether holding the grudge is justified. Some might say the MIL's behavior was bad, so the author isn't wrong. Others might argue that not forgiving for six years is too long and that the author should let go for the sake of family relations.\n\nI need to decide if the author's actions make them the asshole. The author's stance is that the MIL's criticism was unnecessary and hurtful, so maybe they're justified. However, the length of time and the refusal to move on could be seen as stubbornness. Also, the author is cutting off a part of the relationship (cooking) without resolving the issue, which might not be healthy. \n\nConsidering that the MIL didn't apologize and the author's feelings are valid, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the author is still holding a grudge without any resolution, maybe they are. It's a bit of a toss-up. However, since the husband is trying to move forward and the author's action is affecting family dynamics, the author might be in the wrong by not cooperating. Alternatively, if the author finds it necessary for their own peace of mind, maybe they aren't. \n\nIn AITA posts, the community often looks at whether the person is being unreasonable despite the other side's faults. Here, the author isn't wrong for being hurt, but holding the grudge for so long without resolution could make them the asshole. The answer might lean towards A, but there's nuance. However, given the options, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. The correct answer based on the analysis would be A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nWait, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but the assistant should decide. Considering that the author is making a choice based on a past event that's not affecting the current relationship, maybe the author is not in the wrong. The MIL's actions were worse, and the author's choice to avoid cooking is their way of coping. So, the answer could be B (No).\n"
