We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, even though others didn't have a problem with it. The author vowed not to cook for them again and is now being asked by her husband to reconcile, specifically for Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The MIL's behavior: she didn't eat the food, asked if it was cooked enough, then later criticized it harshly, even implying she had to do the grilling herself. This hurt the husband, and the wife decided to stop cooking for them as a result. The husband now wants her to move on after six years.\n\nThe main question is whether holding a grudge for this is justified. The wife argues that no one else had a problem, and the MIL's criticism was out of line. The husband's feelings were hurt, which is a valid point. The wife's response\u2014refusing to cook for them\u2014could be seen as a reasonable boundary, especially if the MIL's behavior was disrespectful. However, holding onto this for six years might be seen as holding a grudge, even if the MIL hasn't apologized.\n\nOn the other hand, the MIL's actions were clearly hurtful and unnecessary. The wife is protecting her husband's feelings and setting a boundary. The husband wants to move past it, but the wife's stance is based on the MIL's continued lack of apology. The question is whether the wife is in the wrong for not forgiving someone who hasn't apologized. \n\nIn many cases, forgiveness is personal, but if the other party hasn't shown remorse, it's harder to expect forgiveness. The wife might not be in the wrong for maintaining her boundary. However, the duration (six years) could be a factor. The husband's desire to move on might be reasonable, but the wife's feelings are valid too. The answer depends on whether the wife's actions are seen as justified given the lack of apology and the nature of the MIL's behavior. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, especially since the MIL hasn't apologized and the initial behavior was disrespectful. The wife is setting a boundary, which is acceptable. The answer would likely be B (No).\n"
