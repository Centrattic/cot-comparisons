We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a family cookout that went sideways with the MIL. The main issue is that the MIL didn't eat the food, asked if it was cooked enough, then later complained about it, and the author decided not to cook for them again. Now the husband wants to move on, and the author is wondering if they're in the wrong for holding onto this resentment for six years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. They made a promise to themselves not to cook for their in-laws after an incident that made their husband upset. The MIL's actions were pretty harsh, especially since she publicly complained and didn't apologize. The author feels justified in their decision because no one else had a problem with the food, and the main issue was the MIL's response. \n\nOn the other hand, holding a grudge for six years seems extreme. It's possible that the author is letting one incident define their relationship, even if the MIL might have apologized or the situation was a misunderstanding. The husband is trying to move forward, which suggests he might want to heal the relationship. The author's refusal to cook could be seen as holding onto past hurt, even if the in-laws haven't noticed. \n\nBut then again, the MIL's behavior was inconsiderate and hurtful, especially since it caused their husband emotional distress. The author's vow not to cook again could be a form of self-preservation to avoid future conflicts. However, not cooking for them might not be the healthiest way to handle it. Maybe the issue is more about the author's choice to let this one event affect their actions for so long, rather than the initial conflict itself. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's actions (not cooking for six years) are a reasonable response. While the MIL was at fault in her initial criticism, the author's prolonged refusal could be seen as unforgiving. The question is whether holding a grudge over this is justified. Since the author mentions that the relationship is otherwise good and the in-laws might not even notice, it's possible that the author is the one holding onto the issue. So maybe the answer is that the author is in the wrong for not letting it go. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the MIL's actions were the problem, and the author's decision is a valid response to protect their boundaries. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's actions are seen as justified given the MIL's behavior. If the MIL was clearly inconsiderate and unapologetic, then the author might not be in the wrong. However, the length of time (six years) and not moving on could be seen as the author's fault. The husband's desire to move forward is important too. The author might be holding onto a grudge that the husband is trying to release. So maybe the answer is that the author is in the wrong for not letting go, even if the initial incident was the MIL's fault. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
