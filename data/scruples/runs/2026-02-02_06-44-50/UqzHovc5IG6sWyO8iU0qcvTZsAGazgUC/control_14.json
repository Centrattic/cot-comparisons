We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The incident happened years ago when they had a cookout for the patio opening. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked her husband if it was cooked enough, then later took it back to grill more. Then, a few days later, the MIL went to the husband's work and criticized the food, saying it was terrible and that she had to grill it herself. The husband was upset, tried to talk to her, but she didn't apologize. The author decided not to cook for them anymore, and it's been 6 years. Now the husband wants to move on, and they're considering whether to cook Easter dinner. The author is unsure if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the actions of each party. The MIL's behavior seems harsh. She not only criticized the food but also confronted the husband at work, which is a bit of an ambush situation. The husband was hurt and tried to address it, but the MIL didn't back down. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which they've maintained for six years.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding a grudge. Let's think about the MIL's actions. She was rude and publicly criticized the food, which was a family event. The author's decision to stop cooking is a personal choice. Since the MIL didn't apologize, maybe the author feels justified in their stance. However, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive, especially if the rest of the relationship is good. The author mentions they have a good relationship otherwise, so maybe the issue is just about cooking.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is asking them to move on, which is a common thing in relationships. The author might be using cooking as a silent protest, which could be a form of passive-aggressive behavior. But if the MIL hasn't noticed, maybe it's not hurting anyone. However, the author's decision to not cook could be a way of asserting control or expressing hurt, which might be justified given the MIL's behavior.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The key points are: the MIL's unapologetic behavior, the author's response, and the time that's passed. If the author's action (not cooking) is their way of dealing with the hurt, and if it's not affecting the overall relationship, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, holding a grudge for so long might be seen as problematic, especially if the husband is asking to move forward. The author might be right in not wanting to cook for someone who disrespected them, but the length of the grudge could be an issue.\n\nAnother angle: Did the author overreact? The cookout was a one-time event, and the MIL's comments were harsh. The author's vow to never cook again is a significant reaction. But given that the MIL's actions were hurtful and unapologetic, the author might feel justified. The answer might depend on cultural norms around forgiveness and holding grudges. In some contexts, holding onto this for six years is too long, but if the other party hasn't changed, it might be reasonable.\n\nSo, weighing it all, the author might not be in the wrong. The MIL's actions were inconsiderate and hurtful, and the author is protecting their boundaries. The husband's desire to move on is valid, but the author's choice to not cook is their right. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
