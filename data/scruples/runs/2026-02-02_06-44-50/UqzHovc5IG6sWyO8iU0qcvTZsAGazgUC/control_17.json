We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident years ago. The situation was a cookout where the MIL criticized the food and took it upon herself to re-cook it. Then later, when the husband talked to her, she didn't apologize and kept complaining.\n\nSo, the author stopped cooking for the MIL and FIL after that. The husband now wants to move on, and the author is considering whether they should cook an Easter dinner. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding this grudge.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of each party. The MIL's behavior seems inconsiderate and rude. She criticized the food in front of others, even though everyone else was fine with it. Then she took the issue to her son (the husband) and didn't apologize when confronted. That's pretty harsh. The husband was hurt, which makes sense because his mother was being critical and possibly embarrassing him.\n\nThe author's response was to stop cooking for them. That's a personal choice, but holding it for six years might be seen as a long time. However, it's understandable if the author felt disrespected. The key points here are whether the MIL's actions were wrong and if the author's reaction is proportionate.\n\nThe author's husband is caught in the middle, wanting to reconcile. The author's stance could affect the family dynamics. But the author isn't the one who was directly disrespectful; the MIL was. The author's vow to not cook for them is a personal boundary. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Given that the MIL started the conflict with unkind behavior, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting that boundary. The author might be justified in not wanting to let go if they still feel hurt. Unless the author's actions are causing unnecessary harm without the other party showing remorse, which seems to be the case here since the MIL didn't apologize. So, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't wrong.\n"
