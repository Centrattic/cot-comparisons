We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation is about a cookout where the MIL criticized the food and then later complained to the husband, leading the author to stop cooking for them. Now, the husband wants to move on, and the author is considering whether they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and their spouse built a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the meat, had the FIL check it, then grilled it herself. Later, the MIL criticized the food at work, making the husband upset. The author then vowed not to cook for them again, which they've kept for six years. The husband is pushing to move past it, and they're conflicted about an Easter dinner.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's refusal to cook for the MIL for six years is justified. To determine if they're in the wrong, I need to assess the context. The MIL's actions were hurtful\u2014publicly criticizing the food and making the husband feel bad. The author's reaction was to stop cooking, which is a personal choice. The husband is now asking to move on, but the author feels justified in their stance.\n\nPossible angles: Is holding a grudge for six years too long? Did the MIL apologize or take responsibility? The MIL didn't apologize, so the author might feel justified. However, not cooking for six years could be seen as extreme, especially if it's affecting the relationship. But the author says the MIL might not even notice, and the rest of the relationship is good. \n\nAlso, cultural factors might play a role. In some cultures, family dynamics and forgiveness are prioritized, but the author might feel that their boundaries are valid. The husband's reaction to the MIL's comments was hurt, so the author's support for him could be a reason for their stance.\n\nOn the other hand, holding onto a grudge for so long might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the MIL has changed or if the husband is seeking reconciliation. The author might be missing an opportunity to mend fences, but if the MIL didn't apologize, the author's position is about self-respect and not feeling belittled.\n\nThe key factors here are the MIL's lack of apology, the author's right to set boundaries, and the impact on the family. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for standing by their decision, especially since the MIL didn't own up to her behavior. The husband's desire to move on is valid, but the author has the right to prioritize their own feelings. The question is whether the author is being reasonable. Since the MIL didn't apologize, the author's stance is about protecting their own feelings, which is understandable. However, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as extreme. But given that the author hasn't been cooking for them anyway and the MIL might not even notice, maybe it's not wrong for the author to choose not to cook, especially if it's a personal choice that doesn't harm others. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they had a valid reason to stop cooking after the MIL's hurtful behavior and lack of apology. Their choice to set boundaries is their right, and if others haven't noticed, it's their prerogative to make that decision. The husband's push to move on is valid, but the author isn't obligated to comply if they feel it's not necessary for their peace of mind.\n"
