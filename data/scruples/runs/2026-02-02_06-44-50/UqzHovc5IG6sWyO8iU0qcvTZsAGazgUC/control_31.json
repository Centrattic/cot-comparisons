We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) for an incident that happened several years ago. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points of the story. The author and their husband built a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked the FIL if it was cooked enough, and then later grilled it herself. The in-laws then visited the husband's work, and the MIL criticized the food, leading the husband to feel hurt. The author stopped cooking for the in-laws and has kept that vow for about six years. Now the husband wants to move on, and the author is considering if they're in the wrong for not forgiving the MIL.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author is in the wrong by holding this grudge. Let's consider the perspectives. The author feels wronged because the MIL publicly criticized the food and did it in a hurtful way, leading the husband to walk away. The author stopped cooking for them as a result. The husband, on the other hand, wants to move past this and is asking the author to cook Easter dinner.\n\nFrom the author's point of view, the MIL's actions were inconsiderate and disrespectful. They might feel justified in not wanting to cook for someone who insulted their cooking. Also, the fact that no one else had issues with the food except the MIL could make the author feel that the criticism was targeted. The vow to not cook for them might be a way to assert their choice and protect their feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, holding a grudge for six years could be seen as excessive. The author might be letting a past event affect their relationship now. The husband is urging to move on, which suggests that there's a desire to maintain family harmony. The author might be in the right if the MIL never apologized, but does that mean the author is in the wrong for not forgiving? It depends on whether the author's reaction is proportionate.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the in-laws might not even notice they haven't cooked in years, so maybe the resentment is one-sided. The author's actions (not cooking) don't necessarily harm the in-laws, but the husband's feelings are caught in the middle. The husband might be caught between his wife's feelings and his parents' potential confusion or hurt.\n\nIn terms of typical \"AITA\" scenarios, often the one holding a long grudge is seen as the one at fault unless there's a valid reason. Here, the MIL's behavior was hurtful, but the author's response is to cut off cooking for them, which is a personal choice. However, the length of the grudge (six years) might be seen as excessive unless there's ongoing behavior from the MIL. Since the MIL hasn't apologized or changed, the author might have a reason to hold on to their feelings. \n\nBut then again, relationships often require forgiveness and moving forward. The author might be right to prioritize their feelings and choose not to cook, especially if it's something that still stings. The husband's push to move on is valid too, as maintaining family ties is important. \n\nI think the answer here hinges on whether the author's reaction is reasonable given the circumstances. Since the MIL was unapologetic and the author's action is a personal choice (not cooking) rather than cutting off contact, the author might not be in the wrong. However, holding a grudge for so long could be seen as an issue. But since the in-laws are unaware, maybe the author is not harming them directly. The key is whether the author's actions are justified based on the MIL's behavior. So, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong (B), because they are standing by their decision based on a hurtful experience, and the MIL's actions were disrespectful.\n"
