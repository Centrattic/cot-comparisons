We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the woman's mother-in-law (MIL) being critical of the food at a cookout they hosted. The MIL didn't eat the meat, had her husband check it, then later grilled it herself. Then, a few days later, the MIL criticized the food and blamed the husband's cooking, leading to him being upset. The woman decided not to cook for them anymore, and now her husband wants her to cook Easter dinner.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong for holding a grudge for six years. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The MIL's actions: she didn't eat the food, had it re-cooked, then later criticized the husband's cooking. That seems harsh, especially after taking the initiative to cook it herself. It's possible the MIL felt the food wasn't up to her standards, but the way she handled it\u2014criticizing the husband's cooking publicly or in a way that made him walk away\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nThe woman's response was to stop cooking for them. She's been doing this for six years now. Her husband wants to move on, and she's considering Easter dinner. The key points here are the validity of her grievance and whether holding onto it for so long is justified. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person's actions were reasonable. If the MIL's behavior was unkind and the woman's response was a way to set a boundary, that might be seen as justified. On the other hand, holding a grudge for six years could be seen as excessive, especially if the MIL hasn't apologized and the woman is choosing to let it affect her relationship. \n\nBut in this case, the woman isn't cutting off the MIL entirely, just not cooking for them. She mentions that the MIL might not even notice. Also, the MIL's actions were not just about the food but also about undermining the husband's efforts, which could have hurt his feelings. The woman is supporting her husband emotionally by not cooking, which might be a way to show solidarity. \n\nThe husband's request is to move on, but maybe he's not fully understanding why it's a big deal. The woman might feel that the MIL's actions were a personal slight, not just a comment on the food. If the MIL never apologized, it's hard to say the woman is wrong for still being upset. \n\nIn AITA, if the person's actions are a reasonable response to a wrong, they might not be in the wrong. However, if the response is overly harsh or has been held for too long without any resolution, maybe they are. Here, the woman's response is to stop cooking, which is a boundary. Since the MIL didn't apologize, and the husband's reaction was to walk away, maybe the woman's stance is justified. The fact that she hasn't cooked for them for six years without any apparent reconciliation from the MIL's side suggests that the MIL might not have seen her actions as wrong. \n\nTherefore, the author might not be in the wrong. The answer would be B (No). The woman's decision to not cook is a boundary in response to her MIL's unkind behavior, and it's reasonable if the MIL hasn't apologized and the issue remains unresolved. The husband's push to move on might be valid, but the woman's feelings and the initial transgression could justify her stance.\n"
