We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation revolves around the author not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) for a past incident involving a cookout.\n\nFirst, the author and their husband built a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food at first, then later took it to grill more. The next day, the MIL criticized the food and complained to the husband, leading to him being upset. The author then decided not to cook for them anymore, which has lasted about six years. The husband now wants to move on and have the author cook Easter dinner, but she's resistant.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong for holding this grudge. Let's consider the perspectives. The author's stance is that the MIL's actions were out of line\u2014publicly criticizing the food and making the husband feel bad. The author's punishment is not cooking for them, which has been in place for years. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband is trying to move past the issue, suggesting maturity and forgiveness. The author argues that no one else had a problem with the food, only the MIL. The author's actions have affected their relationship with the in-laws, though it's mentioned they otherwise have a good relationship.\n\nPossible angles: Is holding a grudge for six years justified? The initial incident might have been a misunderstanding. The MIL could have just wanted the meat well-cooked, which she did by grilling it more. However, her subsequent criticism and the way she handled it with the husband was hurtful. The husband did try to address it, but the MIL didn't apologize. The author's decision to stop cooking is a personal choice, but it's a long time. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's reaction is proportionate. The author's action is a form of punishment, but it's a personal boundary. Since the MIL didn't apologize, the author might feel justified. However, the husband is asking for reconciliation, which might be about maintaining family relations. The author's stance could be seen as holding a grudge over a past issue that wasn't even directly their fault (the MIL's behavior), so maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, moving on is part of a healthy relationship, so the author could be considered in the wrong for not letting go. \n\nBut the user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, so maybe the answer is A. But I need to weigh it. The author's decision might be a way to protect themselves from the MIL's criticism, but it's been six years. The fact that the author hasn't cooked for them and the husband is pushing to move on suggests that maybe it's time to let go. However, the author isn't harming anyone else, and the MIL might not even notice. So is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the author's action is a personal choice and not affecting others, maybe they're not in the wrong. The husband is the one wanting to move on, but the author has a right to set boundaries. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But the user thinks A. Hmm. Need to decide.\n"
