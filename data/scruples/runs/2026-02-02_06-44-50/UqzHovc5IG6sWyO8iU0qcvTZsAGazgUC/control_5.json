We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a past incident where the MIL criticized the food at a cookout and later confronted the husband, leading the author to stop cooking for them. Now, the husband wants to move on, and the author is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The cookout happened, the MIL didn't eat the meat initially and then grilled it herself. Then she criticized the food to the husband, which upset him. The author vowed not to cook for them again, and this has lasted six years. The husband is now urging her to cook for them again, like for Easter. The author is unsure if they are in the wrong for holding onto this grudge.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether holding a grudge over an event that's six years old is justified. The author's reasoning is that the MIL's actions were unkind and the husband was hurt, so she's not willing to forgive. But the husband wants to let it go. The author also mentions that the MIL might not even notice the absence of their cooking anymore, and their relationship is otherwise good.\n\nI need to consider different perspectives. From the author's side, the MIL's behavior was inconsiderate and possibly insulting. The fact that the MIL didn't apologize and instead doubled down on her criticism could justify the author's decision to stop cooking for them. The vow was made because of the hurt caused to the husband and the author's own feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, holding onto this for six years might be seen as holding a grudge, which is generally discouraged. The husband is trying to move past it, and the author is being asked to consider forgiveness. The MIL might have apologized or the situation might have been misunderstood, but there's no indication of that in the post. Also, the author's refusal to cook could affect the husband's relationship with his parents, especially if they are close.\n\nAnother angle is whether the punishment (not cooking for six years) fits the \"crime,\" so to speak. The MIL's actions might have been a one-time issue, but the author's response is long-term. However, if the author feels that the MIL's actions were a betrayal of trust or disrespect, then their reaction could be justified.\n\nAlso, the husband's role is important. He was upset by his mother's words and tried to address it, but she didn't apologize. The author's decision to stop cooking might be a way to protect the husband from further hurt, or it might be the author's own way of dealing with the situation.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, forgiveness is often valued, especially in family relationships. But forgiveness is a personal choice and depends on the context. The author might feel that without an apology, it's hard to forgive. The fact that six years have passed might be a test of whether the hurt still lingers unnecessarily.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The author is being too harsh. The MIL might have had a valid concern about the meat being undercooked. Maybe the author overreacted by not cooking for so long. However, the MIL's public criticism and taking the issue to the husband's work could be seen as going too far, making the author's response more understandable.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the balance between holding onto justified anger and moving on for the sake of family harmony. Since the MIL didn't apologize and the author's actions are a personal choice to protect their feelings and their husband's, the author might not be in the wrong. However, if the situation has long been resolved and the author is being stubborn, then maybe they are. But given the details, it seems the author's stance is understandable, so the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
