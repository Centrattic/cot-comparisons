We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a conflict between the author and their mother-in-law (MIL) over a past cookout incident. The key points are:\n\n1. The author and their husband hosted a cookout for their in-laws and others. The MIL didn't eat the meat initially, then re-cooked it, and later criticized the food, even though the husband's father said it was cooked. The husband was upset, and the author vowed not to cook for the in-laws again, a vow they've kept for 6 years.\n\n2. The husband now wants to move on, suggesting cooking Easter dinner, but the author is resistant. The author's reasoning is that the MIL's behavior was inexcusable, especially since no one else had a problem, and they feel justified in their stance. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's refusal to cook for the in-laws is justified. The MIL's actions were critical and hurtful, and the author's husband was also hurt. The author's vow was a response to being disrespected. However, holding a grudge for 6 years seems like a long time. The author is now being asked to move on, but they're reluctant. \n\nThe author's argument is that the MIL's behavior was wrong, and they don't mind if it affects their relationship. On the other hand, holding onto this for years might be seen as excessive, especially if the MIL never apologized. The husband is trying to mend things, but the author is firm. \n\nIs the author in the wrong here? Well, the initial incident was the MIL's fault, but the author's decision to cut off cooking as a form of punishment might be seen as disproportionate. While the MIL's criticism was harsh, the author's response is a form of retaliation that's affecting their relationship with their in-laws and spouse. However, it's also about respecting one's boundaries and feelings. If the author feels that cooking for them is a way to honor their own boundaries, maybe it's not their fault. But holding onto it for so long could be seen as stubborn or inconsiderate of the husband's wishes. \n\nI think there's a balance here. The author isn't entirely wrong because they have the right to set boundaries based on past hurt. However, the length of the grudge might make it seem like they're the one being unreasonable now. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values regarding forgiveness and moving on. But in a general sense, maybe the author is in the wrong for holding a grudge for so long without any resolution from the other side. So the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
