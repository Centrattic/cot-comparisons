We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the story (the author) is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food and took her meat back to the grill. Later, the MIL complained about the food to her son (the husband), leading to him being upset. The author decided not to cook for the MIL and FIL anymore, keeping this vow for six years. Now, the husband wants to move on and cook Easter dinner, but the author is resistant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The MIL's actions were harsh and public criticism, which could be seen as rude or disrespectful. She didn't apologize and continued to be negative, which might have contributed to the author's decision. The author hasn't cooked for them in six years, which is a long time. The question is whether holding such a grudge is justified.\n\nOn one hand, the author's feelings are valid. The MIL's behavior was unkind, and the author felt justified in protecting their feelings by not cooking. The husband's reaction shows he was hurt too. The author mentions they have a good relationship otherwise, so maybe this is a minor issue in the grand scheme. However, holding a grudge for six years could be seen as excessive. Relationships require forgiveness and moving on for the sake of peace and family bonds.\n\nThe husband's desire to move forward is important. If the author keeps holding onto this, it could cause ongoing tension. The author's reasoning is that the MIL was the only one who had an issue, and others didn't mind. That suggests the MIL's reaction was out of line. But not cooking for six years might be overreacting. The author might be right in feeling wronged, but the length of the grudge could be a problem.\n\nAlso, the author claims they don't think the MIL noticed, so it's not hurting anyone. But if the husband wants to reconcile, maybe the author should consider that. In terms of right and wrong, the MIL was in the wrong first, but the author's response might be too harsh. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because holding the grudge for so long isn't healthy, even if the initial incident was wrong. But I need to make sure. Alternatively, B could be the case if the author's actions are seen as justified because the MIL was at fault. The community often values forgiveness in these situations, so maybe the author is in the wrong for not letting go.\n"
