We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident six years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food and then later complained to the husband, leading the author to vow never to cook for them again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The MIL asked if her meat was cooked enough, then refused to eat it and re-cooked it. Then, a few days later, she and the FIL came to the husband's work, and the MIL criticized the food, which upset the husband. The author stopped cooking for them after that. Now, the husband wants to move on, and the author is considering whether to cook for Easter.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nLet me break it down. The author made a personal vow based on a past event that was hurtful. The key points here are the MIL's actions, the husband's reaction, and the author's decision to cut off cooking. The husband has moved on and wants to reconcile, but the author is holding onto the past. \n\nFrom a conflict resolution perspective, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as disproportionate, especially if the MIL's actions were a one-time incident and she didn't apologize. However, the author's feelings are valid if the MIL's criticism was hurtful and public. The author's decision to stop cooking could be a form of self-respect or boundary-setting, especially if they felt wronged.\n\nBut the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If the author's actions are solely based on a past hurt and not on any ongoing issues, then maybe they are being stubborn. However, the author mentions that the MIL didn't apologize and that the husband was hurt too. The author isn't in a conflict with the MIL anymore, just choosing not to cook. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author is letting a past incident affect their present relationship without any resolution, that could be seen as their fault. The husband wants to move forward, which is a valid point. The author might be holding onto anger unnecessarily. \n\nBut the author also points out that no one else had issues with the food, which might have added to the sting of the MIL's criticism. The author's vow is a personal choice, and unless they're actively harming the MIL or the husband, it's their decision. However, if the husband is trying to mend the relationship and the author is refusing, that could be seen as being in the wrong in terms of marital respect and moving past the incident.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions are a personal decision, but if the husband is asking for reconciliation and the author is unwilling, maybe the author is in the wrong for not letting go. But it's a bit gray. The author's feelings are valid, but holding a grudge for six years might be excessive. So, leaning towards A, the author is in the wrong for not moving on despite the husband's wishes and the passage of time.\n"
