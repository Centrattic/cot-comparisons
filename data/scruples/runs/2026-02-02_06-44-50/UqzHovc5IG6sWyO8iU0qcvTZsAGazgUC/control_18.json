We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) for a past incident where the MIL criticized the food at a cookout, leading the author to stop cooking for them for several years.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: the MIL was the only one who didn't eat the food, asked if it was cooked enough, then later grumbled to the husband about the quality of the food. The husband was hurt, and the author decided not to cook for them again. Now, the husband wants to move past it, and the author is considering if they're at fault.\n\nI should consider the fairness of the author's reaction. The MIL's behavior was rude, but was the author's punishment (not cooking for six years) excessive? The author mentions that no one else had a problem with the food, so the MIL's criticism was unwarranted. However, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as harsh, especially if the MIL never apologized and the author's husband is trying to mend the relationship.\n\nAlso, the author's husband is caught in the middle. He wants to move on, but the author is still holding the grudge. The author's reasoning is that their husband should cook, but he can't. The author might feel justified, but maybe they should consider the impact on their marriage and possible reconciliation.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The MIL's actions were unkind, but the author's response could be seen as extreme. The fact that the author hasn't cooked for them for years might be unnecessary if the MIL hasn't made amends. However, the author's feelings of hurt and the vow to not cook again could be a personal choice. But holding onto it for so long might not be healthy. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person's actions are proportionate. The author's punishment (not cooking) is a personal choice, but not necessarily in the wrong. The MIL's behavior was the initial problem. So the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. However, maybe the author should try to let go for the sake of the relationship. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about what's best. The author's action is a self-imposed consequence, so they might not be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
