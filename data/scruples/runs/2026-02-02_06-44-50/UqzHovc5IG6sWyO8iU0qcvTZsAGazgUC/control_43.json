We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food and ended up cooking it herself. Then, years later, the author still hasn't cooked for them again. The husband wants them to move on and cook Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's MIL was ungrateful at the cookout, criticized the food, and made their husband feel bad. The author decided not to cook for them anymore as a result. Now, after six years, the husband is pushing to move past it. The question is whether holding this grudge is wrong.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, they were hurt by the MIL's actions. The MIL didn't apologize and continued to be critical. The author's vow is a way of protecting themselves from further hurt. But is holding a grudge for six years unreasonable?\n\nOn the other hand, the MIL's behavior was inappropriate\u2014publicly criticizing the food and making the husband feel bad. The author's reaction of not cooking for them could be seen as justified. However, after six years, is it fair to still hold onto the grudge? Maybe the author needs to consider forgiveness for their own peace of mind and their husband's request. But the question is about being in the wrong, not just whether forgiveness is better.\n\nThe author hasn't cooked for them in years, but the MIL might not have noticed. The author's main issue is with the MIL's actions, which were hurtful. The fact that no one else had a problem with the food adds weight to the idea that the MIL was being unreasonable. The author's decision to stop cooking could be seen as a personal boundary, which is okay. However, the husband wants to move past it, which suggests that the author might be causing tension in the marriage by not complying.\n\nBut the author argues that they don't think the MIL has noticed, so maybe it's not affecting their relationship. The author's stance is based on the MIL's unapologetic behavior. So, is the author wrong for holding this grudge? If the MIL was clearly in the wrong, then the author's response might be justified. However, holding onto it for six years might be seen as excessive by some. But in terms of right and wrong, the author isn't necessarily the one at fault here. The MIL's actions were problematic, so the author's response is a defense mechanism. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
