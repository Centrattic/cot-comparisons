We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about not forgiving the mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident involving a cookout.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and her husband built a patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked her FIL if it was cooked, then later grumbled about the food quality, even though others were fine. The husband was upset, and the author stopped cooking for the in-laws. Now, after six years, the husband wants to move on, and the author is considering whether to cook an Easter dinner.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding this grudge. Let me break down the factors. The MIL's actions: she didn't eat the food, took it back to grill, then later publicly criticized the food to her son. The author felt hurt, so she stopped cooking for them. The husband is now asking her to move on.\n\nOn one hand, the MIL's behavior was inconsiderate and disrespectful. She publicly criticized the food after the event, which could have hurt the author's feelings. The author's vow to not cook for them anymore seems like a justified reaction to protect her feelings. Also, the author mentions that no one else had issues with the food, which adds to the MIL's unreasonableness.\n\nOn the other hand, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive. The author is being asked to forgive and move on, especially if the in-laws aren't even noticing the lack of meals. The husband's desire to mend the relationship might be important. But the author's stance is that the MIL didn't apologize and the author doesn't want to cook for someone who criticized her efforts.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms around family and forgiveness. In many cases, holding a grudge for such a long time might be frowned upon, especially if the issue is resolved and there's no ongoing conflict. However, if the MIL's actions were part of a pattern of disrespect, it might be more understandable. Here, it seems like a one-time incident, though it had a lasting impact.\n\nThe author also mentions that the relationship is otherwise good. So maybe the main issue is about this one event. The question is whether the author overreacted by holding the grudge for so long. The answer might depend on whether the author's response is proportionate. The author chose not to cook, which is a personal choice and didn't harm others. The husband wants to move on, but the author's right to set boundaries is also valid.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. However, the MIL's actions were unkind, and the author's response is a way to protect her feelings. If the author is willing to cook without resentment, that's one thing, but she's not obligated to if it causes her pain. Since the in-laws aren't even noticing, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for maintaining her stance. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
