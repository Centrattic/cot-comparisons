We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food and took it upon herself to re-cook it, then later complained about the meal to the husband.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The author is upset because the MIL not only criticized the food in front of others but also approached the husband directly to complain, which caused him emotional distress. The author has taken a vow not to cook for them anymore as a result. Now, the husband wants to move on, and the author is being asked if they're in the wrong for holding onto this grudge for six years.\n\nSo, considering the dynamics of family relationships, forgiveness is often seen as a positive trait. However, the author isn't just holding a grudge; they've taken a concrete action\u2014refusing to cook for the MIL and FIL. The question is whether this is justified. \n\nThe criticism from the MIL might have been unkind and unnecessary, especially since others didn't have issues with the food. The author's reaction is to cut off a part of their relationship (cooking meals) as a form of punishment or to set a boundary. But is that fair? On one hand, the MIL's behavior was inconsiderate and hurtful. On the other, the author is maintaining a long-standing boycott, which could be seen as holding onto resentment.\n\nThe husband's perspective is that it's time to move on. The author's argument is that the MIL didn't apologize and that others didn't have the same issue. However, holding a grudge for six years might be excessive. The author hasn't mentioned any further conflicts, just that they have a good relationship otherwise. So maybe the author is right to protect their boundaries, but maybe they could find a middle ground.\n\nThe question is whether the author is \"in the wrong.\" If being in the wrong means they shouldn't have a grudge, then maybe yes. But if it's about setting boundaries, maybe not. The key is whether the action (not cooking) is a reasonable response to the past incident. Since the MIL's behavior was hurtful and unapologetic, the author's decision to stop cooking might be a form of self-respect rather than being in the wrong. However, the length of time could be a factor. Six years is a long time, and refusing to cook for a family dinner (like Easter) might be seen as unnecessary, especially if the MIL hasn't acknowledged the hurt.\n\nSo, there's a balance between holding onto past hurt and moving forward. The author might not be in the wrong for protecting their feelings, but the husband's push to move on suggests that maintaining family harmony is also important. The answer might depend on cultural expectations around forgiveness and in-laws. In some views, the author is justified; in others, holding onto this for so long is unkind. The user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but others might see it as a boundary. The correct answer here probably leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because they had a valid reason and set a boundary, even if others might criticize the duration.\n"
