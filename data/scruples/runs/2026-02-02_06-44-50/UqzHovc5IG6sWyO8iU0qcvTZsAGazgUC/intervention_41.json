We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) for a past incident involving a cookout. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author and their husband built a patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked her husband if it was cooked, then later grilled it herself. Then a few days later, the MIL criticized the food to the husband, making him upset. The author decided not to cook for them anymore and has kept that vow for six years. Now the husband wants to move on, and the author is considering whether they're in the wrong.\n\nThe author's main argument is that the MIL was the only one who criticized the food, and others didn't mention any issues. They feel justified in holding a grudge. The question is whether the author is at fault for not forgiving and moving on.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the perspectives. The MIL's actions were unkind and harsh, especially taking the time to criticize the food in front of the husband. That's definitely rude and could hurt feelings. The husband was upset, which makes sense. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which they've done for years. But is holding a grudge for six years excessive?\n\nOn one hand, the MIL's behavior was inconsiderate and hurtful. The author has every right to feel upset. On the other hand, holding onto that for such a long time might be seen as not letting go. The key points here are the severity of the MIL's actions versus the author's response.\n\nThe author mentions they have a good relationship otherwise, so this is a minor issue. The husband is trying to move on. The author's vow could be seen as a way to take a stand, but maybe it's unnecessary if the MIL has changed or if the situation was a one-time thing. Also, the author's decision not to cook for them might not even be noticed, so it's not causing active harm.\n\nBut does that mean the author is in the wrong? If the author is choosing to hold a grudge without any resolution from the MIL, maybe they are. However, the MIL didn't apologize. The husband tried to address it, but she doubled down. So the author's stance could be justified. However, holding a grudge for six years might be excessive, even if the MIL was at fault. The author could be seen as being stubborn or not willing to forgive, which is a personal choice but might be considered wrong by some.\n\nIn terms of social norms, forgiveness and moving on are often encouraged, especially for minor issues. Since the author hasn't cooked for them for years and the MIL might not even notice, the author's actions don't seem to be actively punishing or hurting anyone. But the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If the author is intentionally holding a grudge without any change in the MIL's behavior, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if the author's refusal to cook is causing unnecessary tension or is seen as petty, then they might be in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. The key is whether the author's response is proportionate. The MIL's actions were hurtful, but the author's six-year vow might be too long. Since the author is now being asked to move on by the husband, and the MIL hasn't apologized, the author has a valid reason to be upset. However, choosing to let it go could be healthier for the relationship. \n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a reason to be upset, and the MIL didn't apologize. However, the decision to hold a grudge for so long could be seen as wrong. But the answer is A or B. Since the author is choosing not to cook for them, which might be unnecessary if the MIL's actions were a one-time mistake and the author isn't being harmed, it's possible they are in the wrong. Alternatively, if the author's actions are a justified response to the MIL's unkindness, then they aren't. \n\nI'm leaning towards A (the author is in the wrong) because holding a grudge for six years over a single incident, especially when it's affecting the marriage, might be excessive. However, the MIL's behavior was inconsiderate. But the author's vow is a personal choice. The question is if they are \"in the wrong,\" which is subjective. In AITA terms, sometimes the person is considered in the wrong if their reaction is seen as too harsh. Given that the author's action (not cooking) isn't affecting anyone else and the MIL hasn't made amends, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the husband's desire to move on is a factor. \n\nI think the correct answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the MIL was at fault, the author's response is a personal boundary, and there's no indication the author is harming anyone by not cooking. However, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. But in AITA scenarios, sometimes the person is considered in the wrong if their reaction is seen as too harsh. However, the author's stance is reasonable if they feel hurt and the MIL hasn't apologized. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
