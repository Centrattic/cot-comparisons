We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves their mother-in-law (MIL) criticizing the food at a cookout years ago, and the author hasn't cooked for them since. The husband is now asking to move on and wants the author to cook for Easter.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked her husband if it was cooked enough, then took it back to grill more. Then later, the MIL criticized the food and the husband had to take it to her. The author hasn't cooked for them since, which has been six years. The author claims that no one else had issues with the food, just the MIL. The husband wants to move on, but the author is reluctant.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author's action is holding a grudge for six years because of a past event. The question is whether this is justified. On one hand, the MIL's behavior could be seen as inconsiderate and harsh, especially since she criticized the effort and made the husband walk away. On the other hand, holding a grudge for six years over a single incident, especially when the author claims the MIL hasn't noticed the change in behavior, might be seen as extreme. The author isn't cooking for them, which could be a passive-aggressive response. However, the author might feel that it's their way of coping with the hurt caused by the MIL's actions.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, forgiveness and moving on can be a personal choice. The author isn't causing harm anymore by not cooking, but they are also choosing not to reconcile. In terms of being the \"asshole,\" it's about whether the author's actions are unreasonable. The author's husband is trying to move forward, but the author's stance is about holding onto past pain. Since the MIL hasn't apologized, maybe the author's stance is understandable, but holding it for six years might be seen as excessive. However, the author isn't hurting anyone else\u2014just not cooking, which isn't a major issue. The husband is okay with cooking, but he's not a good cook. The author's position is that they haven't noticed, so maybe the author isn't in the wrong because their actions aren't affecting the MIL's feelings. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person's actions are proportionate and if they're being unfair. Here, the author's punishment is not cooking, which is a personal choice. The MIL's original behavior was unkind, but the author's response is a long-term grudge. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because they are standing by their decision without causing harm, and the husband should handle his family dynamics. However, some might argue that holding a grudge for so long is unreasonable, making the author the asshole. \n\nI think the key is that the author isn't harming anyone, and the MIL hasn't acknowledged the mistake. The author's choice to not cook is a personal boundary. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
