We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) for an incident six years ago. \n\nFirst, the MIL didn't like the food at a cookout the couple hosted. She asked her husband about the meat's doneness, then cooked it more herself. Then, later, she criticized the food to the husband, which upset him. The author decided not to cook for the MIL again, and now the husband wants to move on, suggesting cooking Easter dinner.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the MIL's behavior was unacceptable, especially since others didn't have issues. They haven't cooked for the MIL in years, and the relationship is otherwise good. They're wondering if they're in the wrong for holding onto this grudge.\n\nTo analyze: The MIL's actions were ungracious and hurtful, especially in front of others. However, the author's response is to cut off a part of the relationship (not cooking) as a form of punishment. Holding a grudge for six years might be excessive. The husband wants to move on, and the author's stance could affect their marital relationship. \n\nBut the author argues that the MIL's comments were unique and not from others. They might feel justified in their reaction. However, refusing to cook for them for years could be seen as a personal punishment, which might not be fair to the husband or the broader relationship. The author might be holding onto resentment unnecessarily, even if the MIL's actions were wrong. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, forgiveness and moving on are often emphasized for the sake of relationships. So, even if the MIL was in the wrong, the author's refusal to cook after all these years might be seen as the author being in the wrong now. The author's vow is affecting their current relationship with their husband, and perhaps they should consider reconciliation.\n"
