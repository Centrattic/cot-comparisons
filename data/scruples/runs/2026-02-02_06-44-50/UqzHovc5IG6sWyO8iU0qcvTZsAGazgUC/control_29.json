We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, even though others didn't have a problem. The author has since stopped cooking for them, and now the husband wants to move on, suggesting cooking Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The key points are the MIL's actions and the author's response. The MIL publicly criticized the food, even going as far as re-cooking it in front of everyone. Then, she told the husband the food was terrible when he wasn't there, which made him upset. The author stopped cooking for them as a result.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The author's decision to stop cooking is a personal choice. They have a good relationship otherwise, so maybe the issue is minor. The MIL's behavior was unkind and possibly hurtful, especially since it was behind the husband's back. The author's response is a way to protect their feelings and set a boundary. \n\nBut the husband is pushing to move on. The question is if holding a grudge for six years is wrong. The author might be justified if they feel wronged, but maybe the situation isn't a big deal in the grand scheme. However, the MIL's actions were specifically targeting the author's cooking, which is a personal matter. \n\nThe answer likely depends on perspective. If the author isn't causing harm by not cooking and the MIL hasn't apologized, then the author isn't necessarily wrong. The answer might be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries after being treated poorly. The MIL's behavior was the issue, so the author's response is understandable.\n"
