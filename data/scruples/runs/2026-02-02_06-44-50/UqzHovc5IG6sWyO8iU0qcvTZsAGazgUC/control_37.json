We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author and their husband built a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food at first, made the husband's dad check if it was cooked enough, then took it back to grill more. Then, a few days later, the MIL criticized the food again when the in-laws visited the husband's work, making the husband upset. The author decided not to cook for them anymore, which has lasted about six years. Now the husband wants them to move on and even cook Easter dinner, but the author is resistant because the MIL was the only one who criticized the meal, and others didn't have a problem. The author is asking if they're the \"asshole\" for holding onto this grudge.\n\nFirst, I should consider the actions of both parties. The MIL's behavior seems to be inconsiderate and disrespectful. At the cookout, she publicly criticized the food by grilling it herself, which could be seen as undermining the author's efforts. Then, later, she made the same criticism to the husband, causing him emotional distress. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which has been an ongoing decision for years. \n\nNow, the key points here. The author is holding a grudge for six years over an event that happened some time ago. The husband is pushing for forgiveness and moving on. The author is not cooking for them anymore, which might be a personal choice, but the husband is involved as he's the one who had the conversation with his mom. The author's rationale is that the MIL was the only one who criticized the food, while others didn't mind. Also, the author claims that the in-laws might not even notice the change.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the MIL's actions were unkind. She didn't just voice a personal preference during the cookout; she took it upon herself to alter the food, which could be seen as condescending. Then, later, she criticized the food again, which hurt the husband's feelings. The author's decision to stop cooking could be a way to set a boundary, especially if the MIL's behavior was part of a larger pattern of disrespect. However, holding a grudge for six years is a long time. It might be reasonable if there were repeated issues, but the author mentions that otherwise, they have a good relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband is advocating for moving on. Maybe he feels that the situation was a one-time misunderstanding, and the MIL's comment was not meant to be malicious. The author, though, might still feel the sting because it's about their efforts and being disrespected. But in the context of a family relationship, especially with in-laws, holding onto such a grudge for years can strain the relationship. The author is choosing to let the husband take charge of future events, which the husband is not good at, so the author might not want to cook again. \n\nI should also consider cultural or family norms. In some families, cooking is a significant gesture of hospitality, so not cooking for in-laws might be seen as a withdrawal of that gesture. However, if the author feels it's a way to protect their feelings and set a boundary, it's their right to do so. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving. The wrongness would depend on whether the author's actions are justified. Since the MIL's behavior was hurtful and the author is protecting themselves, maybe not in the wrong. But holding a grudge for six years is a long time, and the husband is involved in trying to reconcile. \n\nThe author's response was to stop cooking, which is a personal choice. The MIL's actions were unkind, so the author isn't the one who started the conflict. However, the author's refusal to cook now might be seen as a passive-aggressive response if the in-laws don't realize the reason. But if the author is honest and sets boundaries, maybe it's justified. The key is whether the author's current stance is reasonable. The husband is asking them to move on, so maybe the author should consider that. But the author might feel that the MIL hasn't apologized, so there's no reason to let go. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for protecting themselves after being treated poorly. The MIL's actions were the catalyst. However, the length of the grudge could be seen as excessive if the issue was a one-time event. But the author is not cooking for them again unless they have to, which they don't. Also, the author's husband was hurt, and the author's decision was a reaction to that. \n\nI think the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The MIL's behavior was inappropriate, and the author's response is about self-respect and boundaries. The author is choosing not to engage in a situation they find hurtful, which is valid.\n"
