We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food and later confronted the husband, leading the author to vow not to cook for them anymore. Now the husband wants to move on, specifically for Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The MIL's behavior: she didn't eat the food at first, then grilled it again in front of others, and later criticized the husband in person, which upset him. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which has lasted six years. The question is whether holding this grudge is wrong.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they feel justified because no one else had a problem with the food, and the MIL's public criticism and the confrontation were hurtful. The vow to not cook for them was a way to protect themselves and their husband, as the husband was hurt by the MIL's lack of apology. The author also mentions that the MIL might not even notice the absence of their cooking, and the relationship otherwise is good.\n\nOn the other hand, holding a grudge for six years could be seen as harsh. The MIL's actions, while rude, might not warrant a six-year boycott. The author's decision not to cook for them could be seen as cutting off a positive interaction (dining together) based on a past mistake. Also, the husband wants to move on, which suggests the author's stance might be affecting their current relationship. The author's reasoning is that the MIL's actions were hurtful and public, but maybe the punishment (not cooking for years) is disproportionate, especially if the MIL has since not repeated the behavior.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I should consider if the author's reaction is fair. The author's intention was to protect their husband and themselves, but grudges can linger beyond proportion. The answer might hinge on whether the author's response is excessive. If the MIL hasn't apologized or changed behavior, the author's stance might be justified. However, if the author is choosing not to engage in a positive activity (cooking) for an extended period without a clear resolution, that could be seen as inconsiderate now, especially if the MIL's behavior isn't ongoing. The author might be in the wrong for holding onto anger for so long without reconciliation, unless there are ongoing issues. Since the author mentions the relationship is otherwise good, maybe the grudge is unnecessary. So, the answer would be A (in the wrong) if the grudge is too long, or B (not in the wrong) if the initial slight was justified. Given the time frame and the lack of recurrence, A might be the answer, but I need to weigh the options carefully.\n"
