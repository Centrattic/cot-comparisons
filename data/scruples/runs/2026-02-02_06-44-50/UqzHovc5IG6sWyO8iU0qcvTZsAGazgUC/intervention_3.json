We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after a past incident. Let me break down the situation to understand it better.\n\nFirst, there's a cookout where the author and their husband built a DIY patio. They invited both sets of parents and some others. The food was served, and everyone was eating except the MIL. She asked the FIL if the meat was cooked enough, he said yes, but she didn't eat it, took it back to the grill, and cooked it more. The author thought it wasn't a big deal. Then a few days later, the MIL visited the husband's work and criticized the food, saying she had to grill it herself. The husband got upset and walked away. She didn't apologize, just repeated her criticism. The author then vowed never to cook for them again, which they've kept for about six years. Now the husband wants to move on, and the author is considering whether to cook Easter dinner. They mention that the in-laws haven't noticed the lack of meals and that the relationship is otherwise good.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know if that's the case. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nHmm. Let me consider the key points here. The initial incident: the MIL was picky about the meat's doneness. The author and husband hosted a cookout, which is a social event. The MIL's behavior during the cookout might have been inconsiderate or ungrateful, especially if the author put in effort to cook for them. Then later, the MIL took the opportunity to criticize the food publicly to the husband, which is a different level of issue. The husband was hurt, and the author stopped cooking for them as a result.\n\nNow, the question is whether holding a grudge for six years is justified. The author's reasoning is that the MIL was ungrateful, didn't apologize, and the author is protecting their feelings. On the other hand, the husband wants to move past it. The author's vow is personal, and they haven't been cooking for the in-laws since then. The user is asking if that's fair.\n\nI need to evaluate the fairness of the author's stance. The MIL's actions: during the cookout, she didn't eat and then later criticized the food. The author might feel that their effort was not appreciated. The fact that the MIL didn't apologize could be a reason for the author to hold onto their feelings. However, withholding a service (cooking) for six years because of a past incident could be seen as holding a grudge. The author might be punishing the in-laws for the MIL's actions, even if the in-laws are unaware. The husband's position is to move on, so maybe the author is letting past hurt affect their present relationship.\n\nBut then again, the author is within their rights to not want to cook for someone who criticized their work without apology. However, it's been six years, which is a long time. The question is whether the author is being reasonable in not forgiving. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to balance the facts.\n\nThe MIL took a passive-aggressive approach by not eating first and then later criticizing the effort. The author's reaction is to stop providing a service they once did. The husband is caught in the middle, wanting to reconcile. The key factors here are whether the author's actions are justified and if holding onto this for six years is fair. The author might be right to protect their feelings, but the duration and the fact that the in-laws haven't noticed could suggest that the author is the one holding onto the issue. The MIL didn't directly address the author, but her criticism to the husband might have affected the author's relationship with their spouse. So, maybe the author is not in the wrong because they were hurt by the MIL's actions and the lack of apology. However, the user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, so maybe they think the issue is minor and the author should have moved on. \n\nAlternatively, the author's decision to stop cooking isn't hurting anyone, as the in-laws haven't noticed. The author is content with their choice, and the husband is just wanting to mend things. If the author is okay with it and the in-laws aren't missing out, maybe it's not necessarily wrong. But the husband's desire for closure might be valid too. \n\nI think the main point is about whether the author's reaction is proportionate. The MIL's behavior was hurtful and ungrateful, but the author's response of not cooking for six years could be seen as extreme. However, if the author genuinely felt wronged and the MIL didn't apologize, maybe the author isn't the one in the wrong. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) if the author's choice is about self-respect and the MIL's unapologetic behavior. But if the user thinks the author is overreacting, then A. But since the user says they think the author is in the wrong but want a different perspective, maybe the answer is B. Wait, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author is justified, then B. If not, A. The situation seems like the author is reacting to a personally hurtful situation and protecting their own feelings, which might be okay. The MIL's actions were inconsiderate, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not forgiving. So the answer would be B.\n"
