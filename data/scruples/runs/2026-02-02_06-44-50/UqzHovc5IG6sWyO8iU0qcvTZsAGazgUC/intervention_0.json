We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about not forgiving the mother-in-law (MIL) for a past incident where the MIL criticized the cookout food and then later took a stand about the meat being undercooked, leading the author to vow not to cook for them again.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's MIL made a comment about the food being bad and had to grill it herself. The husband was upset and asked her to apologize, but she didn't. The author then decided to stop cooking for the in-laws, even though they have a generally good relationship now. The husband is pushing for moving on, like cooking Easter dinner.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding onto this grudge. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to see the assistant's take.\n\nI should consider the context. The MIL's actions were hurtful and unapologetic. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which is a personal choice. However, keeping a vow for six years might come across as holding a grudge, especially since the MIL didn't apologize. But also, the author might feel justified because the comment was public and hurtful to their husband. \n\nOn the other hand, not forgiving and holding onto that for years could be seen as unfair, especially if the MIL hasn't acknowledged her actions. The author's rationale is that no one else had a problem with the food, so the MIL's criticism was out of line. The author's vow is a personal boundary, but it's been a long time. The husband is now asking to move on, but the author is hesitant. The author might feel justified in their stance because of the hurt caused, but others might say it's time to let go.\n\nI need to weigh the hurt caused by the MIL versus the author's response. The author hasn't mentioned seeking forgiveness from the MIL, but the MIL didn't apologize. The author's action is a form of self-protection. However, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive. The answer could be either way, but the key is whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving. If the MIL was unapologetic, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not forgiving. But if the author is causing harm to their relationship by not moving on, that's another aspect. \n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but the assistant needs to decide. Considering the situation, the author's response is a reaction to a hurtful event where the other party didn't apologize. The author's choice to set a boundary is understandable. However, maintaining that boundary for six years without resolution might be seen as holding a grudge. But if the author is content with their decision and the relationship remains otherwise good, maybe it's not the author's fault. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the author's action is a personal choice in response to a hurtful event, and the MIL hasn't apologized. The author isn't obligated to forgive if the other party hasn't shown remorse. The vow to not cook is a form of self-respect and boundary setting.\n"
