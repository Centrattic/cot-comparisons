We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong (AITA) for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a cookout a few years ago where the MIL was critical of the food. The author stopped cooking for the in-laws after that and now the husband wants them to cook Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The patio cookout was their own event, and the MIL didn't eat the food, then later criticized it during a work visit. The husband was upset and asked her to apologize, but she didn't. The author hasn't cooked for them since, which is now 6 years. The husband wants them to move on, but the author is hesitant. The author claims their relationship with the MIL is otherwise good, and they don't think the MIL noticed the lack of cooking.\n\nSo the main issue is whether holding a grudge for 6 years is justified. The author's punishment is not cooking again, which seems like a personal choice. The MIL's actions were disrespectful, especially since the cookout was their event and she was critical without prior notice. The husband was hurt by her comments, which adds to the tension. However, the author is now being asked to forgive and move on, possibly for Easter.\n\nI should consider the balance between personal feelings and family dynamics. The author might feel their efforts were undervalued, and the MIL's criticism was public and harsh. On the other hand, holding onto this for so long could strain the relationship further. But the author isn't cutting off the MIL entirely, just choosing not to cook. If the MIL hasn't noticed, maybe the author isn't causing any harm now. The fact that the husband is pushing for reconciliation might be a factor, but the author's agency in their own feelings is important.\n\nAlso, the initial event wasn't a major incident. The MIL just didn't like the food and expressed it poorly. The author's vow not to cook again is a way to protect self-esteem, I suppose. But is it fair for the husband to expect forgiveness after so long? Or is the author within their rights to still be upset?\n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The MIL's behavior was unkind and unnecessary, and the author's response is a personal choice to avoid further hurt. The husband's push for moving on might be valid, but the author isn't obligated to forgive. Since the MIL hasn't apologized and the situation is past, the author's decision to not cook again is understandable. The key is that the author isn't harming anyone now and the relationship is otherwise good. So the author isn't the wrong one here.\n"
