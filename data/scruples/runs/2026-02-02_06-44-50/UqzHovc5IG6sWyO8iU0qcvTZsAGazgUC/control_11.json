We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, leading to tension with the husband, and the author has since stopped cooking for them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The MIL's behavior seems ungrateful and undermining. She didn't eat the food, then later criticized it when the author's husband was present. The husband was hurt, and the author decided to stop cooking for them as a result. Now, the husband wants to move on, and the author is conflicted.\n\nThe question is about whether holding a grudge for six years is justified. On one hand, the MIL's actions were inconsiderate and hurtful, especially coming from a guest who was critical without showing grace. The author's decision to stop cooking could be seen as a reasonable boundary to protect their relationship with their husband and to avoid future hurt.\n\nOn the other hand, holding onto this for years might be seen as harboring resentment. However, the author mentions that the MIL never apologized, which could make forgiveness harder. Also, the author has maintained a good relationship with the in-laws otherwise, which suggests that their stance isn't about cutting off relations entirely but about personal boundaries.\n\nThe AITA (Am I the Asshole) aspect usually looks at whether the person's actions are overly harsh or if they're the one being unreasonable. In this case, the author's response is measured\u2014stopping cooking, not cutting off contact. The MIL's behavior was the initial problem. So the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B, No.\n"
