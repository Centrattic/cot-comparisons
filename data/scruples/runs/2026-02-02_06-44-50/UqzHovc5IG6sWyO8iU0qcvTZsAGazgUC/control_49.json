We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about a mother-in-law (MIL) who criticized the food at a cookout, leading the author to stop cooking for them for years.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author and her husband built a DIY patio and hosted a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food at first, then grilling it more herself. Later, she complained to her son (the author's husband) about the food, which upset him. The author then decided not to cook for them anymore, keeping the promise for six years. Now the husband wants her to cook for Easter, but she's reluctant.\n\nSo, the key points are: MIL's behavior at the cookout, the subsequent criticism, the author's vow not to cook again, and the current conflict. The question is whether the author is wrong to hold onto that vow.\n\nI should consider the perspectives. The author might feel that the MIL's criticism was harsh and unnecessary, especially since others didn't complain. The husband is urging her to move on, which could be about maintaining family relations. MIL, on the other hand, might have had a valid concern about food safety (meat being undercooked) but handled it poorly by criticizing the son instead of addressing it directly during the cookout.\n\nThe author's decision to stop cooking could be seen as holding a grudge. But maybe it's justified if the MIL's actions were disrespectful and caused emotional harm. However, six years seems a long time not to cook for them. The fact that the author has a good relationship otherwise is a point in her favor. The MIL's behavior might have been toxic, especially if she repeated the criticism and didn't apologize.\n\nBut the husband is in the middle, possibly feeling caught between his parents and spouse. The author not cooking for them might not hurt the MIL, but it could affect the husband. If the husband wants to reconcile, the author might need to consider that. However, the author's feelings about the incident are valid, and it's not necessarily wrong to set boundaries after such a hurtful experience.\n\nThe answer depends on whether the vow is a reasonable boundary or an unnecessary grudge. Since the MIL continued to be critical without apology, the author's stance might be justified. So, the answer is probably B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
