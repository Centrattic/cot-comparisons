We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation again carefully. The author is asking if they're at fault for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened years ago.\n\nThe incident involved a cookout where the MIL didn't eat the meat because she thought it wasn't cooked enough. She later complained to her son (the author's husband) about the food, leading to his hurt feelings. The author then vowed not to cook for the in-laws again, and it's been six years. Now the husband wants to move on, and the author is conflicted about cooking Easter dinner this year.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions are justified. The MIL's behavior seems a bit harsh. She criticized the food and took it upon herself to reheat it. But when she later complained to the husband, that's where things escalated. The husband was upset, but the author decided to hold a grudge by not cooking for them. \n\nThe key points here: The author's decision was based on the MIL's criticism. But is holding a grudge for six years excessive? The author argues that others didn't have an issue with the food, so the MIL's complaint was unwarranted. The husband is now asking to move forward, and the author is considering whether to comply.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about whether the author's continued refusal is justified. The MIL's actions were rude and ungrateful, but does the author's response cross into being unreasonable? The author hasn't cut off the MIL entirely, just stopped cooking. However, after six years, maybe it's time to let go. Also, the author mentions the husband is a non-cook, so this is a point of contention. \n\nThe author's stance is that the MIL's criticism was the last straw. The husband's hurt feelings were valid, but the author's reaction is about their own boundaries. The question is whether holding onto this for six years is fair. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they are standing up for themselves and their boundaries. The MIL's behavior was inconsiderate and hurtful, and the author has the right to decide how to respond. However, some might argue that holding onto the grudge for so long is excessive, but given the context, the author's reaction seems reasonable. So I would lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
