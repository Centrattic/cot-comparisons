We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman who hasn't cooked for her in-laws for six years after an incident where her mother-in-law criticized the food at a cookout.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the sequence of events. The family had a cookout where the MIL didn't eat the meat, asked her husband if it was cooked enough, then later grilled it herself. Then, the MIL later criticized the food, leading the husband to be upset. The author vowed not to cook for them again. Now, the husband wants her to move on and cook Easter dinner, but she's holding onto the grudge.\n\nThe author's perspective is that the MIL was harsh and unfair, especially since no one else had a problem with the food. The husband is asking her to forgive and move on, but she's resistant. The question is whether holding this grudge is justified.\n\nI need to consider the fairness of her reaction. The MIL's actions were inconsiderate and hurtful, especially the part where she criticized the food in front of her husband. The author's vow to stop cooking for them was a response to protect her husband and herself from further hurt. However, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as extreme. \n\nOn the other hand, the MIL's behavior was unkind, and the author isn't the one who made the hurtful comments. The husband's reaction is to want reconciliation, but the author has a right to set boundaries. If the author is willing to maintain a good relationship otherwise, just not cook, maybe she's not entirely in the wrong. However, the husband is caught between two people, so the author's stance might be causing ongoing tension.\n\nIn AITA posts, the community often looks at proportionality. The author's reaction was a vow to stop cooking, which is a boundary. But after six years, is it reasonable to still hold that? If the MIL hasn't apologized or shown any indication of regret, maybe the author isn't wrong. But maybe the husband is trying to mend the relationship, and the author's refusal is hindering that. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It depends on whether her continued refusal is justified. If the MIL hasn't apologized, then it's not entirely her fault. However, the husband's desire to move on should also be considered. The author might be right to protect herself but perhaps could find a middle ground. The answer might be that she's not in the wrong (B), but it's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points. However, since the question is a yes/no, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the initial wrong was from the MIL, and the author is setting a boundary.\n"
