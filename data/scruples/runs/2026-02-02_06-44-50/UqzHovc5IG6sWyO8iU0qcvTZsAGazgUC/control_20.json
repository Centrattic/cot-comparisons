We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about not forgiving the mother-in-law (MIL) for a past incident. The user is the wife who, along with her husband, built a patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food initially, then later criticized it and even grilled the meat herself. The husband was upset when the MIL told him the food was terrible. The author decided not to cook for the MIL and FIL anymore, and now her husband wants her to move on and cook for them again, like for Easter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is holding a grudge because of the MIL's behavior. The question is whether she's wrong for not forgiving after six years. \n\nLet me break it down. The MIL's actions: she didn't eat the food at first, then criticized it, and took it upon herself to re-cook it. Then later, when the in-laws visited the husband's work, she told him the food was awful. The husband was hurt and told her he was, but she didn't apologize. The author is upset because no one else had a problem with the food, making the MIL's criticism stand out.\n\nNow, the author vowed not to cook for them again, which has lasted six years. The husband now wants her to move on. The author is asking if she's in the wrong for holding onto this grudge.\n\nI need to consider the reasons for her holding the grudge. The MIL's behavior was clearly negative and hurtful. The husband was upset, and the MIL didn't apologize. The author's decision to not cook for them could be seen as a way to set a boundary after a hurtful experience. However, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive, especially if the relationship is otherwise good. \n\nBut on the other hand, the MIL's actions were unkind and possibly undermining the author's efforts. The author might feel that the criticism was unfair, especially since others didn't have issues. The fact that the MIL didn't apologize adds to the resentment. If the author is making a point by not cooking, it could be a way to show that the MIL's actions had consequences. However, if the author is now being asked to cook again, maybe the husband is suggesting reconciliation. \n\nThe author also mentions that the MIL and FIL might not even notice she hasn't cooked for them, so maybe the grudge is more about the author's feelings than the MIL's awareness. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, holding a grudge for six years might not be healthy, but it's a personal choice. The MIL's behavior was hurtful, so the author's reaction might be understandable. However, refusing to cook for six years because of a one-time incident (even if it was hurtful) could be seen as extreme. The key points are whether the author's response is proportionate and if it's healthy to hold onto this for so long. \n\nIn some perspectives, forgiveness is encouraged to let go of past hurts, but it's a personal decision. The author might feel justified because the MIL didn't apologize and the criticism was unmerited. On the other hand, maybe moving on is better for the marriage and family relationships. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the MIL was at fault, and the author's response is a personal boundary to protect herself from being hurt again. However, some might argue that holding onto it for six years is unreasonable. But given the context, the author's stance could be seen as justified, especially if the MIL hasn't shown remorse. So, likely answer B.\n"
