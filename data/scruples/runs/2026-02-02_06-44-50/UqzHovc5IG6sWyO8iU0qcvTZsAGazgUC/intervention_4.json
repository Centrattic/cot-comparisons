We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident six years ago.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple had a cookout where the MIL didn't eat the food, took it back to the grill, and later criticized the food, which led to the husband being upset. The author decided not to cook for the MIL and FIL anymore, and now the husband wants to move on, but the author is still holding a grudge.\n\nI need to consider the key points here. The initial incident: the MIL was dissatisfied with the food, which could be a valid concern if the meat was undercooked. However, she didn't address it calmly; instead, she grilled it herself in front of others and later criticized the food to her son, making him upset. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which has lasted six years. The author's husband is now pushing to move past this, and the author is conflicted.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong for holding onto this grudge. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know the community's perspective.\n\nPossible angles: The author's reaction is a personal choice. If the MIL's actions were hurtful and the author felt it was a betrayal, maybe holding a grudge isn't wrong. However, holding onto something for six years might be seen as excessive, especially if it affects family relationships. The author is not cooking for them, which could be a form of punishment or passive-aggressive behavior. The husband is trying to mediate, but the author is resistant. Also, the author mentions that the MIL might not even notice the absence of meals, so the impact on the MIL isn't clear. The author might see it as a personal boundary, but others might think letting go after six years is healthier.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often values forgiveness and moving on, especially if the initial issue was resolved. The author's husband tried to address it with the MIL, and she didn't apologize, which adds to the hurt. However, not cooking for six years might be seen as holding a grudge, especially if the MIL hasn't made any effort to reconcile. The author might be justified in their feelings, but the length of time could be a problem.\n\nI should also consider cultural norms. In some cultures, holding onto such matters is more accepted, while in others, it's frowned upon. The author's decision to not cook again could be a way to protect their own feelings, but it's impacting the family dynamic. The key here is whether the author's actions are reasonable. If the MIL's behavior was indeed hurtful and there's no closure, the author's stance might be understandable. However, the husband's perspective is also valid in wanting to move forward. \n\nThe answer would depend on whether the author's actions are proportionate. Since the author isn't cooking for their in-laws and it's been six years, some might say that's too long, while others might support the author's right to set boundaries. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the community might be split. However, AITA often leans towards forgiving and moving on, so maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong). But I need to be careful. The MIL's actions were disrespectful, and the author's response is a personal choice. If the author feels they can't forgive, perhaps that's their right. The answer is a bit ambiguous, but given the time that's passed and the husband's desire to move on, the community might side with the author being in the wrong. Alternatively, if the MIL never apologized and the husband was hurt, the author's stance could be seen as justified. Hmm. I think the answer is A, but I'm not 100% sure. The key is whether holding a grudge for six years is unreasonable. In AITA, holding onto old grudges is often seen as the person being in the wrong. So I'll go with A.\n"
