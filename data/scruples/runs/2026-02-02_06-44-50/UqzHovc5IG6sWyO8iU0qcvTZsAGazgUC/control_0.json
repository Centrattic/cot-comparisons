We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law after this cookout incident. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their husband made a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, said it wasn't cooked enough, and then later criticized the food to the husband, making him upset. The author decided not to cook for them again as a result. Now, after 6 years, the husband wants to move on, but the author is still holding the grudge.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the facts. The MIL didn't eat the food, which could be a personal preference (like maybe she's picky about how her meat is cooked). But then she went to the husband at work to complain about the food quality, implying the author's cooking was bad, which hurt the husband. The author felt this was a personal attack, so they stopped cooking for the MIL. \n\nNow, the author is being asked if they're in the wrong for holding this grudge. On one hand, the MIL's behavior was hurtful and maybe unnecessary. She took the issue to the husband instead of addressing it directly with the author. That could be seen as undermining the author. The author's reaction was to stop cooking for them, which is a personal choice. The author mentions that other guests didn't have issues with the food, so the MIL's complaint might have been isolated. \n\nOn the other hand, holding a grudge for 6 years might be seen as excessive. The husband is asking to move on, so there's a push for reconciliation. The author argues that the MIL might not even notice the absence of their cooking and that the relationship is otherwise good. So maybe the author isn't being unreasonable. \n\nBut is it fair to say the author is in the wrong? The author's actions (not cooking) were a response to a perceived slight. If the MIL was inconsiderate, then the author's decision might be justified. However, not forgiving could be seen as holding onto past hurt. The key points are whether the MIL's actions were unjustified and if the author's response was proportionate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the MIL's actions were hurtful, and they have a right to set boundaries. The author isn't cutting off the MIL entirely but is choosing not to cook for them, which might be a reasonable boundary. The husband's desire to move on might conflict with the author's need to maintain that boundary. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They were hurt by the MIL's actions and chose to set a boundary, which is a personal choice. The fact that others didn't have issues supports the idea that the MIL's criticism was unwarranted. The author isn't ignoring the MIL entirely, just choosing not to cook for them, which is a reasonable response.\n"
