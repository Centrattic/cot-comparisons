We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving her mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a past incident where the MIL criticized the food at a cookout, leading the author to stop cooking for them. Now, after several years, the husband wants to move on, and the author is considering whether to cook Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The MIL took issue with the meat's doneness, then later criticized the food and took it to the husband, who was upset. The author stopped cooking for them as a result. The question is whether holding a grudge for six years is justified.\n\nI should consider the context. The MIL's actions were pretty harsh. She didn't just express a preference; she made a big deal out of it, even after the event. Her comment to the husband was hurtful, leading him to walk away. The author's reaction was to stop cooking, which is a significant action. Now the husband is asking to move on, but the author is reluctant.\n\nThe author argues that no one else had a problem with the meat, which suggests the MIL's criticism might have been excessive. The author's vow to never cook again is a personal choice, but after six years, is that still reasonable? The user thinks the author is in the wrong, so I need to see if that's valid.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, holding a grudge for years over an event that others might see as minor could be seen as excessive. However, the MIL's behavior was disrespectful, both to the author and her husband. The author's actions are a form of self-respect and setting boundaries. The husband is asking the author to forgive, but forgiveness might be hard if the MIL hasn't apologized. \n\nThe author's stance could be seen as justified if the MIL's actions were hurtful and unapologetic. On the other hand, holding onto this for so long might be affecting the relationship and the husband's wishes. The author might be in the right to protect her own feelings, but not forgiving could also be seen as stubborn. \n\nI think the key points are the MIL's unkind actions and the author's right to set boundaries. The fact that the MIL never apologized might make the author's stance more defensible. However, the length of time could be a factor. The answer likely depends on whether holding a grudge is considered reasonable given the circumstances. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is protecting herself from someone who was disrespectful and hasn't shown remorse.\n"
