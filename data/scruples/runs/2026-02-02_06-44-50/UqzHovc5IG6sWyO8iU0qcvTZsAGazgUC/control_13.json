We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a family conflict involving the mother-in-law (MIL) and the author's response to an incident from years ago.\n\nFirst, the incident in question was a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, even though she initially didn't eat it, then took it back to grill more. Then, a few days later, she told the husband the food was terrible and she had to grill it herself. The husband was upset, and the author decided not to cook for the MIL and FIL anymore. Now, the husband wants to move on, and the author is considering whether to cook an Easter dinner or not.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the MIL overstep? Was her criticism justified? The author is holding a grudge for not cooking for them. Is that right or wrong?\n\nFrom the description, the MIL's actions seem harsh. She criticized the food publicly (through her son) and didn't apologize. The author's response was to stop cooking for them. The husband is now pressuring the author to move on and cook again.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the MIL's behavior was probably inappropriate. She made a judgment about the food and didn't apologize, which upset her son. The author's decision not to cook for them might be seen as a justified response to protect the husband's feelings and set boundaries. However, holding a grudge for six years could be seen as overly harsh. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving and cooking again.\n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up for their standards and not letting the MIL's criticism affect their relationship. On the other hand, holding a grudge so long might affect family dynamics and the husband's relationship with his parents. The author's reasoning is that the MIL was uniquely critical, others didn't have issues, and the MIL didn't apologize. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the MIL was at fault. The author is setting a boundary. However, sometimes holding onto past grievances can be seen as unkind. But given the MIL's lack of apology and the husband's hurt feelings, maybe the author's stance is justified.\n\nSo the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the initial conflict was the MIL's fault, and the author is protecting their husband's feelings and setting appropriate boundaries.\n"
