We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman who hasn't forgiven her mother-in-law (MIL) for a past incident involving a cookout. The main points are:\n\n1. The MIL didn't eat the meat at the cookout and later grilling it herself, then criticized the food.\n2. The husband was upset when the MIL criticized the food, and the wife vowed not to cook for them again.\n3. It's been 6 years, and the husband wants to move on, but the wife is refusing.\n\nThe question is whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong for holding onto this grudge.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the actions of each party. The MIL's behavior seems rude and ungrateful. She didn't eat the food, then later took it upon herself to re-cook it and then criticized the hosts. That's inconsiderate, especially since others were enjoying the meal. The husband was clearly hurt by her comments, and the wife's reaction was to stop cooking for them, which has lasted years.\n\nThe wife's stance is that she's not the one to apologize because no one else had issues with the food. The MIL's actions were a personal slight, and the wife is holding a grudge. The husband is trying to move past it, but the wife is still holding onto it.\n\nNow, considering the concept of forgiveness and holding grudges. In many cases, holding a grudge for 6 years over an incident like this might be seen as excessive, especially if the other party hasn't apologized. However, the MIL didn't apologize, so the wife might feel justified. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nThe key points are: Was the wife's reaction reasonable? Is holding a grudge for 6 years warranted here? The wife's actions (not cooking for them) are a form of punishment, which could be seen as her holding a grudge. The husband is trying to mend the relationship, but the wife is still hurt. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person is being unreasonable or if the other party is at fault. The MIL's behavior was inconsiderate, but the wife's response of refusing to cook for 6 years might be seen as disproportionate. The wife is in the right to feel hurt, but holding onto it for so long without any resolution could make her the \"asshole\" in the situation. Especially since the husband is trying to move forward and the wife is not letting go. \n\nHowever, the wife isn't being asked to forgive the MIL, just to cook for her. The author is asking if she's in the wrong for not forgiving. The answer might hinge on whether her actions (not cooking) are a reasonable response. Since the MIL didn't apologize and the wife's actions are a personal choice, some might see it as her right to protect her feelings. But others might say that after 6 years, it's time to let go for the sake of the relationship. \n\nIn AITA, the community often sides with the person who is trying to maintain relationships unless the other party is clearly in the wrong. Here, the MIL was inconsiderate and unapologetic, so the wife isn't wrong for being upset. However, the length of time and the refusal to cook could be seen as holding a grudge. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the MIL's actions were worse, and the wife is justified in her feelings. But others might argue that holding onto it for 6 years is the problem. \n\nI need to decide based on typical AITA responses. Usually, if someone is holding a grudge without resolution, they might be considered the AITA. However, if the other party was clearly wrong and didn't apologize, the person holding the grudge might be seen as justified. The wife isn't being mean to the MIL, just not cooking for them. The husband is trying to move on, but the wife is within her rights to have boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong). The wife isn't in the wrong for holding onto the grudge since the MIL's actions were inconsiderate and she didn't apologize. The wife is setting a boundary, which is her right.\n"
