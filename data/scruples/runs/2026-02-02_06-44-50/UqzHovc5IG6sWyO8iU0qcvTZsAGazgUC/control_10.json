We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident several years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, leading to a rift.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and their husband built a patio and hosted a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the meat, had it grilled longer, and later complained about the food to the husband, causing him distress. The author decided not to cook for the MIL again, and six years later, the husband wants to move on, but the author is reluctant.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nI should consider the context. The MIL's actions were unkind and public criticism through the husband, which could be seen as undermining the author. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which is a personal choice. The husband is now asking to move past it, but the author's stance is based on a specific hurtful event. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about personal boundaries and forgiveness. The author isn't harming anyone by not cooking; it's their choice. The MIL's behavior was inappropriate, so the author might not be in the wrong for holding onto the decision. However, holding a grudge for six years could be seen as overly long, but the author justifies it based on the public criticism and lack of apology. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the MIL's actions were hurtful and unapologetic. The author's response is a boundary, which is valid. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
