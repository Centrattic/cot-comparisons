We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law. The situation involves a past cookout where the MIL was critical of the food, leading to a rift. The author hasn't cooked for them since, and the husband wants to move on.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The MIL didn't eat the meat initially, then took it back to cook it. Then she criticized the food at her son's workplace, which upset the husband. The author decided not to cook for them again as a result. Now, the husband wants to reconcile, but the author is holding onto the grudge.\n\nSo, the main question is whether holding a grudge for six years is justified. The author's reasoning is that the MIL's criticism was harsh and public, and that others didn't have issues with the food. The husband is asking them to move on, but the author is reluctant.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit subjective. The author's actions are a personal choice, but relationships often require forgiveness and moving past conflicts. The MIL's behavior was unkind, but the author's response is a long-held resentment. The author might feel justified, but holding onto it for six years could be seen as unnecessary. Also, the husband is trying to mend the relationship, and the author's refusal might affect that.\n\nHowever, the author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical. It's more about emotional maturity and whether the grudge is harming others. Since the MIL might not have noticed, maybe the author's vow isn't affecting others except the husband. The key is whether refusing to cook is a reasonable response. It's a personal boundary, but the length of time might make it seem excessive. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the author is within their right to set boundaries based on past hurt. However, it's a gray area. The author isn't wrong for not forgiving, but perhaps could consider reconciliation for the husband's sake. But the question is if they're in the wrong, and the answer is no.\n"
