We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened years ago.\n\nThe situation: The author and their husband built a patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, took it back to grill more, and later criticized the food, even telling the husband it was terrible. The husband was hurt, and the author decided not to cook for the MIL anymore. Now, the husband wants to move on, and the author is conflicted about cooking for them again, like for Easter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of each party. The MIL's behavior was unkind and possibly hurtful. She publicly criticized the food and then reamed the husband for it. That's not just about the food; it's an attack on his efforts. The husband was upset and had to walk away, which shows the emotional impact.\n\nThe author's reaction was to stop cooking for the MIL, which has been ongoing for six years. The author's reasoning is that no one else complained, and the MIL was the only one who did. The author is now being asked if they're in the wrong for holding a grudge this long.\n\nOn one hand, holding a grudge for six years seems excessive, especially if the relationship is otherwise good. The author might be avoiding conflict or holding onto resentment, which can be unhealthy. The husband wants to move past it, which is a reasonable request if there's no ongoing issue.\n\nHowever, the MIL's actions were indeed hurtful and perhaps unapologetic. If the MIL never apologized and continues to be critical, the author might feel justified in their stance. The key here is whether the author's refusal to cook is a reasonable response to an unapologized slight or if it's an unnecessary hold on the past that's affecting the current relationship.\n\nThe author has a good relationship with the MIL otherwise, so the author's decision not to cook might be impacting the family dynamic. The husband is caught in the middle, trying to mend the relationship. The question is whether the author's actions are justified or if they should let go.\n\nIn terms of social norms, forgiveness and moving on from past issues is often encouraged, especially if it's causing strain in the present. The author's vow has lasted six years, which is a long time. The fact that the author can't even remember the exact timeline suggests that it's been a while, and holding onto it might not be serving their current relationships.\n\nSo, while the MIL's actions were wrong, the author's response of not cooking for six years might be seen as holding a grudge. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) aspect is about whether the author is being unreasonable in their stance. Since the author is now being asked to consider moving on and the relationship is otherwise good, the author might be in the wrong for not letting go. However, if the MIL hasn't shown any remorse, the author's feelings are valid, but the prolonged refusal to cook could be the issue here.\n\nConsidering all that, the author might be in the wrong in the eyes of the AITA community because holding a grudge for six years is seen as excessive, especially if there's no ongoing issue. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
