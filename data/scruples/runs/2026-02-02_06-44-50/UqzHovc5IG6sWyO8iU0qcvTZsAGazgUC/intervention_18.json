We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident several years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, leading the author to stop cooking for them.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's MIL didn't like the meat's doneness, even though others ate it. She then complained to her son (the author's husband) at his workplace, causing him distress. The author decided not to cook for them anymore, and now the husband wants to move past it, asking if the author is in the wrong (AITA) for holding onto this.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that no one else had a problem with the food, so the MIL's criticism felt especially harsh. The husband is pushing for forgiveness, maybe for family harmony. The author is conflicted because they still have a good relationship with the MIL, just not around cooking.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics: the MIL's actions were inconsiderate and possibly undermining. Taking someone aside to criticize the host's cooking in front of others (even if it was just the husband) could be seen as rude. The fact that she didn't apologize and repeated her criticism adds to the offense. The author's vow to stop cooking is a way to set a boundary, which is understandable if they felt disrespected.\n\nHowever, holding a grudge for six years might be excessive. The author's husband is suggesting moving on, which could be for the sake of family relationships, especially for events like Easter. But the author might feel justified in their stance if the MIL's behavior was particularly hurtful. It's a balance between personal boundaries and family expectations.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally or morally, it's subjective. The author isn't wrong for being upset, but holding onto it for so long could affect family dynamics. The husband's perspective is that it's time to let go, while the author's is about respecting their own feelings. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, common advice is to consider empathy and communication. The author might need to reflect on whether their actions (not cooking) are causing more harm than good. But if the MIL's behavior was indeed hurtful, the author's stance isn't entirely unreasonable. The answer likely depends on cultural expectations around family and forgiveness. However, the author is holding a grudge, which typically is seen as being in the wrong if it's causing unnecessary strain. But if the MIL is still being unapologetic, the author's boundaries are valid.\n\nGiven that the author is the one maintaining the grudge and the MIL hasn't apologized, maybe the author is not in the wrong. But if the author's refusal to cook is causing ongoing conflict, perhaps they should reconsider. However, the author mentions that the MIL might not even notice, so the impact might be minimal. \n\nOverall, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the author is setting boundaries after being disrespected, and if the MIL hasn't changed, the author has a right to protect their feelings. But the six-year hold could be a point against. However, in AITA contexts, people often aren't in the wrong if they're standing up for themselves after a clear transgression.\n"
