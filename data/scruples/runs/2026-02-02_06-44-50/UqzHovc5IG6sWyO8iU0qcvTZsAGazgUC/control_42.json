We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA story is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, even though she was the one who asked if the meat was cooked enough and then cooked it herself. The author vowed not to cook for them again and has kept that vow for six years. Now the husband wants to move on, and the author is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The MIL's behavior was rude and ungrateful. She criticized the food after taking it upon herself to re-cook it. The husband was upset and tried to address it, but the MIL didn't apologize. The author's decision to stop cooking is a personal choice in response to being disrespected. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The author isn't causing harm by not cooking; the MILs might not even notice. The author's feelings are valid because they were wronged. The vow to not cook is a boundary, which is okay. The husband is encouraging forgiveness, but the author's right to hold a grudge isn't wrong. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could consider moving on for the husband's sake, but the question is about being in the wrong. The answer likely depends on whether holding a grudge is justified. Since the MIL was at fault, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
