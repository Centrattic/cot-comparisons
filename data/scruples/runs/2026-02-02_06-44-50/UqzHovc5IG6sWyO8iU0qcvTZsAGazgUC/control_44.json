We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a past incident where the MIL criticized the food at a cookout, which led the author to stop cooking for them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and husband made a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food initially, grilled it more, and then later complained about the quality, even though others didn't have issues. The husband was upset and the author vowed never to cook for them again. They haven't cooked for the MIL for six years, and now the husband wants to move on. The author is considering whether they're in the wrong by holding onto this grudge.\n\nSo, the main question is about forgiveness and whether the author's reaction is justified. The user wants a judgment based on the given information. Let's consider the actions of both parties. The MIL's behavior was inconsiderate and hurtful. She criticized the food in front of others, then later berated the husband. The author's vow to stop cooking was a personal decision as a result. \n\nNow, holding a grudge for six years is a long time. The author mentions that the MIL hasn't apologized and that the author still feels the sting of the situation. However, the husband is advocating for moving on. The author's current stance is that they don't owe the MIL anything, especially since the relationship is otherwise good. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their feelings. The MIL's actions were inappropriate, and the author has a right to set boundaries. The fact that the author hasn't cooked for them in years and the MIL might not have noticed suggests that the author isn't actively causing harm by not cooking. The husband's desire to move forward is valid, but the author isn't obligated to forgive if the MIL hasn't apologized. \n\nAlso, the author's vow was a personal choice, and it's their decision to maintain that boundary. Since the MIL's behavior was a specific incident and the relationship is otherwise good, the author's actions are understandable. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
