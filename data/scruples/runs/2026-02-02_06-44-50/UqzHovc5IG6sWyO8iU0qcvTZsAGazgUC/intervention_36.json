We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) for a comment made about the food at a cookout six years ago.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author and their husband built a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food initially, asked her husband if it was cooked enough, and when he said yes, she put it down. Later, she went back to grill it more. Then, a few days later, she criticized the food at my husband's work, making him upset. The husband tried to address it, but the MIL didn't apologize. The author then decided not to cook for the in-laws anymore, and now the husband wants them to cook Easter dinner. The author is conflicted about holding onto this vow for so long.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider the arguments here. The author's decision to stop cooking for the MIL because of her criticism. The key points are: the MIL's actions (asking about the meat, grilling it herself, and later criticizing it), the husband's reaction, and the author's six-year vow. \n\nOn one hand, the author might feel justified if the MIL was being ungrateful or disrespectful. The fact that the FIL confirmed the meat was cooked but she still didn't eat it, then took over the grilling, could be seen as overstepping. The MIL's subsequent criticism to the husband, without apologizing, might have caused real hurt. The author's vow to not cook for them could be a way to set a boundary to avoid similar situations.\n\nOn the other hand, holding a grudge for six years seems excessive. The original incident was a one-time event, and the author hasn't cooked for them in years. The husband is now urging to move on, which implies that maybe the past issue isn't as significant now. Also, others at the cookout didn't mention the meat being undercooked, so the MIL's reaction might have been harsh. However, the author's response of cutting off a monthly activity (dinner) for a past slight could be seen as disproportionate. \n\nIt's possible the author is using this as a way to express broader dissatisfaction, but the story doesn't indicate that. The author mentions having a good relationship otherwise. The question is about forgiveness and moving on. The husband's perspective might be that the issue was resolved when he addressed it with the MIL, but she didn't apologize. The author's punishment is ongoing and possibly self-imposed. \n\nIn many AITA discussions, the main issue is the length of time held against someone. Even if the MIL was rude, six years is a long time. The author might be the one holding onto the grudge, which could be seen as their fault. Also, the author's husband is now the one being affected by their decision, as he wants to reconnect. The author's stance might be causing more harm than the original incident. \n\nBut maybe the author is justified if they feel the MIL's actions were disrespectful, especially after the husband tried to handle it. The author could be standing up for themselves by not cooking for someone who's been critical. However, the act of not cooking for six years is extreme. \n\nI need to weigh the original wrongdoing against the punishment. The MIL's action was a few years ago, and the author has been avoiding cooking for them since. The husband is now pushing to move on. The author's position could be considered holding a grudge, which is often seen as unfair in AITA scenarios. Unless there's more to the story, the answer might be A for the author being in the wrong. But if the author felt the MIL was being unnecessarily harsh and the husband is now pressuring them to reset boundaries, maybe B. But the user thinks A, and the analysis leans towards the author's prolonged refusal being the issue. So likely, Answer A.\n"
