We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a mother-in-law (MIL) who criticized the food at a cookout the author and her husband hosted. The author stopped cooking for the MIL for years after that, and now her husband wants her to move on and cook for them again, like an Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The MIL initially didn't eat the food, asked if it was cooked enough, then later grilled it herself and then criticized the food. The author took this personally and stopped cooking for them. Now, after six years, the husband wants to move on, but the author is still holding a grudge.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know if that's the case. So, the main question is whether holding a grudge for six years over this incident is justified. \n\nLet me consider both sides. The MIL's actions could be seen as inconsiderate. She made a comment that upset her son, which is part of the reason the author is upset. The author's response was to stop cooking for them. But is that an overreaction? Cooking is a personal thing, and if the author is hurt by the criticism, maybe it's okay to set a boundary. However, holding a grudge for six years might be excessive, especially if there's no further issues and the relationship otherwise is good. The author is not cooking for them, but maybe the husband is trying to mend things. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the MIL didn't apologize, so the author's stance is that the MIL was wrong and she's not forgiving her. But is it necessary to keep the grudge? Maybe the author is being too rigid. The husband is trying to move past it, which is a valid point. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to be upset. The criticism was personal and affected her relationship with her husband. If the MIL is still not acknowledging her mistake, the author might feel justified in not cooking. But maybe the author could find a middle ground, like cooking a simple meal without taking it too personally, or not cooking but still maintaining a good relationship. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's action (not cooking) is a proportionate response compared to the incident. Since the MIL's actions were hurtful but perhaps not malicious, and the author is holding onto it for so long, maybe the author is in the wrong for not letting go. The husband's position is that it's time to move on, which suggests that the family dynamic is being affected. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because holding a grudge for such a long time without any apparent resolution from the MIL's side might be too harsh, and it's affecting the family. However, if the author genuinely feels hurt and needs to set boundaries, maybe not. But since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and given the context, I think the answer is A.\n"
