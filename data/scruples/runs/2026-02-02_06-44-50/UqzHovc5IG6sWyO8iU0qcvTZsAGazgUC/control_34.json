We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened years ago. So, the situation is about a cookout where the MIL was critical of the food, even though others didn't have a problem. The author decided not to cook for the MIL and FIL anymore, and now the husband wants to move on, so the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The MIL was unhappy with the meat's doneness, asked her husband, then ended up grilling it herself. Then a few days later, she criticized the food to the husband, making him upset. The author stopped cooking for them, and it's been six years. The husband wants to move on, but the author is resistant. The question is whether holding this grudge for so long is wrong.\n\nSo, from a fairness perspective, the MIL's actions were unkind and probably hurtful. She publicly criticized the food and made the husband feel bad, even after he tried to address it. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which is a personal choice. But holding onto this for six years might be seen as holding a grudge. However, the author's reasoning is that the MIL was the only one who had an issue, and others didn't. The author's husband is trying to move forward, so maybe the author is being too rigid here.\n\nBut is it the author's responsibility to forgive? Well, the author isn't the one who was directly criticized. The husband was the one who was hurt, and he's trying to reconcile. The author's vow was to not cook for the MIL, which could be a form of punishment. However, if the author feels that the MIL's actions were unacceptable and there's been no apology, it's understandable to hold onto that. But after six years, maybe it's time to let go for the sake of family relations, especially if the MIL hasn't noticed the change and the author's relationship with them is otherwise good.\n\nThe key factors here are the duration of the grudge, the impact on family dynamics, and whether the author's actions are justified. The author's stance could be seen as reasonable if they believe the MIL's behavior was inexcusable and there's been no reconciliation. But holding it for so long might not be healthy. The husband's perspective is that it's time to move on, which suggests that he values the relationship with his parents and wants to mend things. The author might be missing an opportunity for healing if they continue to hold onto the past.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't technically in the wrong because it's their personal choice how to handle the situation. However, from a relational standpoint, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as unkind or unnecessary. The answer depends on whether the author is choosing to maintain their boundaries or letting go for the family's sake. Since the author hasn't caused any harm beyond their own decision not to cook, they aren't in the wrong per se, but they might be advised to consider moving past it.\n"
