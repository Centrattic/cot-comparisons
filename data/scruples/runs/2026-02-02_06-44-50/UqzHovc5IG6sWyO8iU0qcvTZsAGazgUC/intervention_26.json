We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL (mother-in-law) didn't eat the food, grilled it herself later, and then criticized the author's cooking. The author hasn't cooked for them in six years. Now the husband wants to move on, and the author is considering whether to cook Easter dinner. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author and her husband put effort into building a patio and hosting a cookout. The MIL found the meat undercooked, but only she didn't eat it. The FIL said it was cooked, but she still didn't eat and then re-cooked it. Then, the MIL criticized the food at work, which upset the husband. The author vowed not to cook again, and even after six years, she's holding onto that. The husband now wants to move on, but the author is hesitant.\n\nThe main question is whether holding a grudge for six years is justified. The user suggests the author is in the wrong. I should consider if the MIL's actions were inconsiderate. Bringing up the issue at work, especially in a private conversation, might be seen as harsh or undermining. The author's reaction is to stop cooking, but maybe that's excessive. However, the MIL's criticism wasn't just about the cooking; it was about having to do it herself, which might imply a lack of appreciation for the author and husband's effort. \n\nBut here's the thing: it's been six years. The author hasn't let it go, which could be seen as a long-held grudge. The husband is trying to move on, so maybe they need to address this. The author's vow to not cook for them could be hurtful, even if the MIL hasn't noticed. The author might be holding onto resentment over something that was a misunderstanding. The cookout was a shared effort between the husband and the author, so the MIL's criticism affected the husband more. But the author is using cooking as a form of punishment. \n\nOn the other hand, the MIL's actions were inconsiderate. She didn't just say the meat was undercooked in front of everyone but instead took it upon herself to re-cook it, which could be seen as dismissive. Then, criticizing the food in a way that embarrassed the husband. The author's decision to stop cooking might be a way of protecting her husband and standing up for herself. But six years is a long time. The husband is now asking to move forward, so maybe it's time to reconcile. \n\nThe dilemma is whether the author is being reasonable or if her response is disproportionate. The MIL might not have apologized, but the author could have addressed it more constructively. Holding a grudge for so long might be the author's fault. However, considering the emotional impact and the fact that the husband was directly affected, maybe the author's stance isn't entirely wrong. \n\nBut the key point is that the author is using a vow to not cook as a way to punish the MIL without addressing the issue. The husband is trying to move on, so the author's refusal might be affecting their relationship. The author should consider if letting go is healthier, even if the MIL hasn't apologized. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, it's often seen as healthier to forgive and move on, especially when the issue is old. The author might be in the wrong for not letting go of the grudge. The answer would be A.\n"
