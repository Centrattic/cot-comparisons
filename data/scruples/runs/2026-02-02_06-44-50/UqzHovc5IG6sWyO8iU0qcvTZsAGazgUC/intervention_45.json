We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a MIL (mother-in-law) being critical about a cookout. The author and their husband built a patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the meat at first, then cooked it herself later. Then a few days later, she came to the husband's work to tell him the food was terrible and that she had to grill it herself. The husband was upset and told her, but she didn't apologize. The author then decided not to cook for them anymore, and it's been six years. Now the husband wants to move on, and the author is considering if they should cook Easter dinner.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The MIL's actions seem pretty harsh. She criticized the food publicly or at least in front of the husband, which could have been embarrassing. The author is holding a grudge because of this, not cooking for them for years. The question is whether holding this grudge is justified.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that no one else had a problem with the meat, only the MIL. They feel hurt by the criticism and the MIL's refusal to apologize. But keeping it up for six years might be excessive. Is the author overreacting? On the other hand, the MIL's behavior was disrespectful. Maybe the author is justified in their feelings.\n\nBut the author is cutting off a relationship aspect (not cooking) because of a past incident. The MIL might not even realize the impact. The husband is trying to move on, so the author's refusal could be causing tension. The key points are the initial hurt and whether holding onto it is reasonable. Maybe the author isn't wrong because they were wronged, but maybe not holding it for six years is unreasonable. Alternatively, the author's stance is a personal choice, but maybe they are in the wrong for letting it fester. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's response is proportionate. Not cooking as a form of punishment without reconciliation attempts might be seen as harsh. But if the MIL was in the wrong initially, the author isn't necessarily wrong for being upset. The question is if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving. If the MIL was at fault, the author isn't wrong for holding onto it. But maybe the author should consider moving on for their own well-being and the husband's. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about what's healthier. \n\nSo maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the MIL's actions were the initial problem, and the author is reacting to that. The author isn't in the wrong for not forgiving when there's no apology or change in the MIL's behavior.\n"
