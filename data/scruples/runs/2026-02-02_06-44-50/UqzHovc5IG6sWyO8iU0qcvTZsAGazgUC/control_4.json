We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this (the author) is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, leading to a rift that's lasted six years.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and their husband built a patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the meat, took it back to grill, and later criticized the food. The FIL said it was cooked enough. Then, the MIL went to the husband's work and complained, making him upset. The author stopped cooking for them as a result. Now, the husband wants to move on, especially for Easter dinner.\n\nThe author is considering whether they're at fault (AITA) for not forgiving. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nSo, what factors are relevant here? Let's break it down. The MIL's actions: she didn't eat the meat, then later criticized the food and took it upon herself to grill it. The FIL agreed the meat was cooked, but the MIL still didn't eat. Then she went to the husband's work to complain, which is a bit harsh. The husband felt hurt, and the author stopped cooking for them. The husband now wants to move past it.\n\nIs the author justified in holding a grudge? Well, the MIL's behavior seems rude and ungrateful. The author might feel disrespected. But holding a grudge for six years is a long time. The husband is urging to move on. The author says the MIL might not even notice the change. The relationship is otherwise good.\n\nBut the question is about the author's actions. They stopped cooking for the MIL after a hurtful incident. Is it the author's fault for not forgiving? Or is the MIL at fault for the initial criticism?\n\nThe author's vow is a personal choice. They might feel justified in protecting their feelings. However, holding it for six years could be seen as excessive. But if the MIL hasn't apologized, maybe the author isn't wrong. The key is whether the author overreacted. The MIL's actions were unkind, so the author's resentment is understandable. The husband's perspective is to move on, but the author is allowed to set boundaries. If the author is choosing not to cook for them as a personal boundary, that's their choice. The fact that the MIL might not even notice shows that the author isn't acting out of spite but maybe as a personal boundary. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
