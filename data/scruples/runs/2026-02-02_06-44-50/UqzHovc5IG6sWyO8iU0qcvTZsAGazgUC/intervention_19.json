We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a cookout where the MIL found the meat undercooked, had it re-cooked, and later criticized the food, which led the author to stop cooking for them. Now, after six years, the husband wants to move on, and they're wondering if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The initial event: the author and husband made a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat initially, asked the FIL if the meat was cooked, he said yes, then she went back to grill it. The author doesn't see a problem with that. Then, the in-laws visited the husband's work, and the MIL criticized the food, making the husband upset. The author decided to stop cooking for them as a result. Now, the husband is asking to move on, and the author is considering whether to cook Easter dinner.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. They might believe that holding a grudge for six years over a past incident is unreasonable. But I should consider both sides. The author might feel that the MIL's public criticism at the cookout and then later to their husband (without apology) was hurtful and disrespectful, leading to their decision. The MIL's actions could be seen as being ungrateful or undermining the effort the couple put into the cookout. However, the author's response\u2014refusing to cook for them for years\u2014could be perceived as a harsh and long-held grudge, even if it's a personal choice.\n\nThe husband mediating the situation by calling his mom to express his hurt might indicate that he's trying to resolve the issue. The author's reasoning is that others didn't complain, so the MIL's criticism was especially hard. But others didn't act on it, while the MIL did. The author's vow to stop cooking could be about personal boundaries, which is valid, but the question is whether it's fair to hold this for six years and if the husband's request to move on is reasonable.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author's decision to set a boundary by not cooking is their right, but the length of time and the fact that the husband wants to reconcile might suggest that the author is holding onto an old conflict unnecessarily. The MIL's behavior was unkind and inconsiderate, but the author's response might be seen as disproportionate if the husband has already addressed it with his mom and there's been no further issues. The author might be in the right to protect their feelings, but the six-year holdout could be impacting the family relationship now. The husband's perspective is that he wants to move forward, so it's a balance between personal feelings and family harmony.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's refusal to cook is justified as a boundary or if it's an excessive punishment. If the author feels that cooking again might not be worth their emotional well-being, then it's not in the wrong. However, if the husband is still trying to maintain a good relationship with his parents and the author's action is making that difficult, then maybe they are in the wrong. But the author's stance that the MIL is the only one who complained and her specific behavior is the issue adds nuance. The author might not be in the wrong for prioritizing their emotional response, but the situation is a bit gray. The user's own thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that.\n"
