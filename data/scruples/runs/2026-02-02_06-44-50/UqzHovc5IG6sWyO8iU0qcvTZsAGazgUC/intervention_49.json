We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, leading the author to vow not to cook for them again. Now, the husband wants to move on, and the author is considering whether to give in for Easter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The MIL didn't eat the food, grilled it herself, and later criticized the meal. The husband was upset, and the author stopped cooking for them. The author's argument is that no one else had a problem with the food, so the MIL's criticism was harsh. They've maintained this vow for years, and their husband is pushing to move on. The author is unsure if they're wrong for holding onto this.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The main factors here are the initial event, the author's reaction, and the duration of the grudge. The MIL's behavior was inappropriate\u2014publicly criticizing the food and making her son feel bad. The author's vow to stop cooking was a personal decision, possibly to protect their own feelings and set boundaries. However, holding onto this for six years might be seen as excessive, especially if it's affecting the marriage. The husband's desire to move on suggests that he might see the value in repairing the relationship with his parents, or at least not letting the past issue continue to affect their interactions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel justified in their stance. The MIL's actions were disrespectful, and the author's decision to stop cooking could be a form of self-respect. If the MIL hasn't apologized or made amends, the author's continued resentment could be seen as a boundary being maintained. However, holding a grudge for so long without attempting reconciliation might be seen as the author's issue now, especially if the MIL isn't aware of the vow and the author's actions are causing marital strain.\n\nThe question also mentions that the author and MIL have a good relationship otherwise. So maybe the author is prioritizing their own feelings over the husband's wishes. The husband's role is important here\u2014should the author comply with his request, or is it okay to maintain their stance?\n\nIn terms of morality, forgiveness is often valued, but it's personal. However, the author's vow is affecting the husband's relationship with his parents. If the author's stance is causing more harm than good, perhaps they are in the wrong. But if the author feels that their dignity was harmed, they might not be wrong in their decision.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's actions are justified. The initial incident was a hurtful situation, and the author's reaction was to set a boundary. However, not forgiving for six years might be seen as excessive. The author could choose to cook for them without letting the past affect their current actions, which might be healthier. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for holding onto the grudge for so long, especially if it's affecting their relationship with their spouse. Alternatively, if the author believes that the MIL's actions were inexcusable and there's no apology, then the author's stance is justified.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong. Considering typical viewpoints on forgiveness and moving on, the answer might lean towards A (Yes). But the author's reasoning for not cooking is valid, so maybe B (No) as well. It's a bit of a toss-up. I need to decide based on the main factors: the initial event's severity, the length of the grudge, and the impact on the marriage.\n"
