We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) for an incident that happened years ago. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation to make sure I understand it. The author and their husband built a patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the meat, said it wasn't cooked enough, then later criticized the food when visiting the husband at work. The husband was upset, and the author decided not to cook for them anymore. Now, after 6 years, the husband wants to move on, and the author is considering whether to cook Easter dinner for them.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nSo, what do I need to consider here? Let's break it down.\n\n1. **The MIL's actions**: The MIL didn't like the meat, asked her husband if it was cooked, then decided to re-cook it herself. Then, later, she criticized the food and took it to the husband at work. This seems harsh, especially in front of others. It could be seen as disrespectful, especially since the author was the one who cooked the meal. The husband was clearly hurt by this.\n\n2. **The author's response**: The author vowed not to cook for the MIL and FIL anymore, which they've done for 6 years. The husband now wants to move on, but the author is resistant. The author feels justified because no one else had issues with the food, and the MIL's criticism was specific. The author also mentions that the husband can cook for them, but he's not a good cook except for grilling.\n\n3. **Current relationship**: The author states that the relationship with the in-laws is good otherwise. The author might not think the in-laws even noticed the lack of cooking, so there's no ongoing hurt.\n\n4. **Holding a grudge**: The key issue here is whether holding a grudge for 6 years is justified. The author's reasoning is that the MIL's actions were hurtful, and they don't want to cook for them anymore. But is this a fair or reasonable response?\n\n5. **Forgiveness and moving on**: The husband is advocating for moving on. The author is being asked if they're in the wrong for not doing so. The question is about forgiveness and whether holding onto this past event is fair.\n\nNow, thinking about this from a moral standpoint. The MIL's behavior was clearly inappropriate. She publicly criticized the food, which was the author's cooking, and then later confronted the husband at work. This could be seen as a breach of respect, and it's understandable that the author would feel hurt and want to set boundaries.\n\nHowever, holding a grudge for 6 years solely because of this incident could be seen as prolonging the hurt. The author is choosing not to cook for them, which is a form of punishment or holding onto past anger. The husband wants to move forward, which suggests that he might be trying to maintain a good relationship with his parents, and the author's actions could be affecting that. \n\nBut the author also has the right to set boundaries if they feel their efforts (like cooking) are not valued. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving. It depends on whether the author's decision is a reasonable response to the MIL's actions. The author's action (not cooking) is a form of self-respect; they're not making the effort if the in-laws don't appreciate it. On the other hand, it's been 6 years, and the author is being asked if it's time to let go. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author is not necessarily in the wrong. If the in-laws truly regret their actions, maybe they should apologize first. But since they haven't, and the author feels justified in their stance, it's a choice to protect their own feelings. However, forgiveness is often seen as a positive trait, so maybe the author is being unreasonable. \n\nBut the user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong. The user might think that holding a grudge for so long is not justified. However, the author's decision is to not cook, not to cut off the relationship entirely. The author has maintained a good relationship otherwise, so it's more of a personal boundary than a complete rejection. \n\nIn summary, the author's actions are a response to a hurtful event. If the MIL hasn't apologized, the author has the right to feel hurt and set boundaries. However, the length of time (6 years) might be excessive. But since the author isn't harming the relationship beyond not cooking, it's a matter of personal choice. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the answer is A (yes), then the reasoning would be that forgiveness is important and holding onto past issues is not. If B (no), then it's about respecting the author's right to set boundaries and not being obligated to forgive if the other party hasn't apologized. \n\nGiven that the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the analysis. I think the answer is B (no), because the author is within their right to protect their feelings and set boundaries, especially if the other party hasn't apologized. However, the author could choose to forgive, but that's a personal choice. Not forgiving doesn't make them wrong in this context.\n"
