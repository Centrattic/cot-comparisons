We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a past incident where the MIL criticized the cookout food and made the husband upset.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The couple had a cookout, the MIL didn't eat the meat, then later took it back to grill. Then the MIL visited the husband at work and criticized the food, leading to the husband being upset. The author decided not to cook for them anymore, which has lasted for 6 years. Now the husband wants to move on, but the author is reluctant, especially since they have a good relationship otherwise.\n\nThe author argues that the MIL's criticism was harsh and that she didn't apologize. The husband is asking the author to cook Easter dinner, but the author is holding a grudge. The key points here are forgiveness, the severity of the incident, and the impact on the family relationship.\n\nOn one hand, holding a grudge for six years seems a long time. The author's decision to stop cooking might be a way to protect themselves from hurt, but it's affecting the family dynamic. The husband is trying to move on, which is important for the marriage. Also, the MIL might not even realize the ongoing issue, so cutting off cooking could be unnecessary if the relationship is otherwise good.\n\nOn the other hand, the MIL's behavior was inconsiderate and hurtful. She publicly criticized the food and didn't apologize, which is valid to be upset about. The author's vow to not cook was a personal boundary, which is their right. However, the question is whether this is the wrong stance after six years.\n\nI think the author might be in the right to set boundaries, but maybe holding onto it for so long is the issue. The husband's request to move on could be about maintaining family harmony. The author's argument is that the MIL's actions were worse than others, and they haven't noticed the change. If the author is content with the current relationship and the MIL isn't aware, maybe it's not their problem. However, staying in a grudge could be seen as stubborn. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because holding a grudge for so long is not healthy, even if the initial action was hurtful. The author should consider forgiveness and the husband's perspective.\n"
