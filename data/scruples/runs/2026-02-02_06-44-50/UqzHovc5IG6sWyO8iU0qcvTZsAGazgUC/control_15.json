We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) for a past incident involving a cookout.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points of the story. The author and their husband built a DIY patio and hosted a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked her husband if it was cooked enough, then later grilled it herself. Then, a few days later, the MIL criticized the food to the husband, making him upset. The author decided not to cook for them again, and it's been six years. Now the husband wants to move on, and the author is conflicted about cooking for Easter.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author is wrong for holding a grudge for six years over this incident. Let's consider the perspectives here.\n\nFrom the author's side, they feel hurt because the MIL publicly criticized the food, which the author had prepared. The fact that no one else had issues with the food except the MIL might compound the feeling of being unfairly targeted. The author's decision to stop cooking for them as a form of protest could be seen as a personal boundary to avoid further hurt.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is urging reconciliation, suggesting that holding onto the grudge might be affecting their relationship. The MIL's actions\u2014criticizing the food and making the husband feel bad\u2014were indeed inconsiderate and could be seen as rude. However, the author's response of a six-year boycott might be excessive, even if it's a personal choice.\n\nNow, considering social norms and typical AITA standards. In these forums, people often judge based on fairness, the proportionality of the response, and whether the situation has been resolved. The MIL's behavior was unkind, especially taking the issue to the husband in a way that hurt him. The author's response of not cooking for them is a personal choice, but holding it for six years might be seen as holding a grudge. However, if the author is maintaining a good relationship otherwise, it's possible they're not the asshole.\n\nBut the key points here are: The MIL's actions were hurtful and unapologetic. The author's response is to stop cooking for them as a form of silent protest, which might be a way to set boundaries. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving. In AITA contexts, people are often expected to move on from past grievances unless there's ongoing harm. Since the author hasn't cooked for them in years, but the MIL hasn't apologized, and there's no indication of current harm, the author's stance could be justified. However, some might argue that holding a grudge for so long is unnecessary, even if the initial wrongdoing was valid.\n\nAnother angle: the husband is caught in the middle. The author's vow might be affecting their relationship dynamics. The husband might feel that moving on is necessary for family harmony. But the author is standing by their decision, which is their right. The fact that the author is considering cooking for Easter shows some willingness to compromise, but they're still hesitant.\n\nIn terms of AITA verdicts, sometimes the person who is technically right in a situation can still be considered the \"asshole\" if their actions are disproportionate or if they aren't moving past the issue. However, if the other party (MIL) hasn't shown any remorse, the author's stance might be seen as reasonable. The answer would depend on whether the author's actions are seen as holding a justified grudge or being overly harsh.\n\nIn this case, the author isn't causing harm to others; they're just choosing not to cook. Their husband is okay with cooking, so it's not a forced issue. The MIL's behavior was inconsiderate, and the author's response is a personal boundary. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
