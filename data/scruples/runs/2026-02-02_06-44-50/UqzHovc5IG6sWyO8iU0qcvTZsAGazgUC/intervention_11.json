We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after this incident. The situation is that the MIL criticized the cookout food, even though she was the one who asked if the meat was cooked enough and then re-grilled it. The author decided not to cook for them again and is now being asked by their husband to move on and perhaps cook for Easter.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The MIL's behavior was unkind and perhaps hypocritical. She took the opportunity to complain behind the author's back, which is rude. The husband was upset, and the author's reaction was to stop cooking, which they've maintained for six years. The husband now wants to move past it, but the author is hesitant.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding onto this grudge. On one hand, the MIL's actions were clearly inappropriate. She criticized the food when she had the chance to check it herself and even re-cooked it. So the author's hurt is understandable. On the other hand, holding a grudge for six years seems extreme. The author hasn't mentioned any further issues, and their relationship is otherwise good. The husband is now asking to move on, which might be about maintaining family harmony.\n\nBut the author's reasoning for not cooking is based on the MIL's hypocrisy and the hurt caused. The author might feel that cooking would be a form of apology or submission. However, the husband is willing to cook instead. The author is also considering that maybe the MIL hasn't noticed the change, so it's not causing current issues. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, forgiveness isn't always a moral obligation, but holding a grudge can be seen as clinging to past hurt unnecessarily, especially if it's affecting the current relationship. The author might be justified in their feelings, but the length of the grudge could be seen as inconsiderate. However, since the author's actions aren't actively harming the relationship and the MIL hasn't apologized, maybe it's not entirely wrong. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. Society often values forgiveness and moving on, even if the other party isn't perfect. So maybe the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because holding such a grudge for so long without a new incident might be seen as unfair. However, the initial wrong by the MIL was real. It's a bit tricky. The husband is part of the equation too\u2014his reaction to walk away and then talk to his mother shows he was hurt. The author's refusal to cook could be seen as a way to protect their feelings, which is reasonable, but maybe the time frame is too long. \n\nI think the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because while the MIL's actions were bad, holding a grudge for six years without any further issues might be excessive, especially when the husband is trying to mend the situation. The author could still set boundaries without completely cutting off their relationship, perhaps by agreeing to cook in their own way or finding another solution. So the author's refusal to budge might be unnecessary now.\n"
