We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) for a comment made years ago about a cookout. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the sequence of events. The MIL didn't eat the meat, asked her husband if it was cooked enough, then later took it to reheat. Then, a few days later, the MIL criticized the food at the cookout and even told her son (the author's husband) that he had to grill it himself, which upset him. The author decided not to cook for them again, and now after six years, the husband is pressuring them to move on and cook Easter dinner.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding a grudge. The author's reasoning is that no one else complained about the meat, only the MIL. They also mention that they have a good relationship otherwise, and the MIL might not even notice the lack of cooking from them.\n\nSo, the key points here are about forgiveness, holding grudges, and whether the author's reaction is justified. The author's husband is advocating for moving on, which is a common theme in family relationships. The author's vow to never cook for them again stems from a specific incident where the MIL was critical, but the author might be generalizing that to all future interactions.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, and I need to consider if that's accurate. On one hand, holding a grudge for six years over an incident that might have been a minor misunderstanding (maybe the MIL was just being particular) could be seen as excessive. The author's decision not to cook could be hurtful if the MIL expects it, even if they haven't noticed yet. On the other hand, the MIL's behavior was disrespectful, and the author might feel justified in their stance, especially since the MIL never apologized.\n\nBut in family dynamics, moving forward is often necessary. The husband's emotional reaction suggests that the MIL's words were harmful, but the author's response (not cooking) is a personal choice that affects their relationship with the in-laws. If the author is maintaining the grudge without any reconciliation, that could be seen as the author's fault. However, if the MIL never showed remorse, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. But holding it for six years without trying to address it could be seen as not in the right.\n\nI think the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because holding onto something this long, especially when the husband is advocating for moving on, might be seen as stubborn. The author's choice to not cook could be a way of expressing hurt, but it's also affecting their relationship. The MIL's actions were wrong, but the author's prolonged response might not be fair.\n"
