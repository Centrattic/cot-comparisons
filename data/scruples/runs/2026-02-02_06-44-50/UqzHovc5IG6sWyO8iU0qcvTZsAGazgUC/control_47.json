We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves their mother-in-law (MIL) criticizing the food at a cookout, leading the author to vow not to cook for them anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author and their husband had a cookout where the MIL didn't like the meat's doneness. She grilled it more herself. Then, a few days later, the MIL complained to the husband about the food's quality and that she had to do the grilling. The husband was upset and asked her to stop, but she didn't apologize. The author then decided not to cook for the in-laws again. Now, the husband wants to move on and have the author cook for Easter, but they're conflicted.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for holding a grudge for six years over this incident. Let's consider the viewpoints. The MIL was critical and didn't apologize, which is hurtful. The husband was caught in the middle and felt it was time to move on. The author's stance is that no one else had a problem with the food, so the MIL's complaint was unfounded. They also mention that their relationship with the in-laws is otherwise good, and maybe the MIL hasn't even noticed they're not cooking anymore.\n\nOn one hand, holding a grudge for six years seems extreme. Maybe the author is using this as an excuse to avoid interactions or has other underlying issues. On the other hand, the MIL's actions were unkind and disrespectful, leading to valid hurt feelings. The author's right to set boundaries is important here. If the author is willing to compromise, like the husband cooking or doing something else, that's a middle ground. But if the author is solely refusing to cook because of the MIL's past behavior, it's a personal choice. The key is whether the author is being unreasonable. The husband's perspective is that it's time to move on, but the author's feelings are also valid. In AITA scenarios, it's often about empathy and fairness. The MIL was in the wrong initially, so the author's reaction might be justified. However, holding a grudge for so long without any resolution might make the author seem stubborn. But since the author hasn't actively harmed the relationships and the MIL might not even notice, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answering B (No) would be appropriate because the author's actions stem from a past valid hurt and they're maintaining a boundary without causing further issues.\n"
