We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident at a cookout. The MIL didn't like the food and later criticized it, which upset the husband. The author vowed not to cook for them again, and now their husband wants them to move on and cook Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The MIL didn't eat the meat, asked her husband if it was cooked enough, then took it back to grill. Then later criticized the food, making the husband upset. The author hasn't cooked for them in six years. The husband is pushing to move on. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author's decision to stop cooking is a personal choice. The MIL's actions were unkind, but the author is holding a grudge for six years. The question is whether the author's refusal to cook is justified.\n\nOn one hand, the MIL's behavior was rude and unappreciative. It's understandable that the author feels hurt and wants to set boundaries. On the other hand, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive, especially if it's affecting the relationship with the husband. The author's husband is trying to move past it, so the author's continued refusal might be straining their marriage.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the MIL might not even notice the absence of their cooking, which adds a layer of futility. The author is choosing to let go of the negative experience on their own terms. However, refusing to cook could be seen as punishing the MIL and the husband unnecessarily. The key here is whether the author taking a stand is justified or if it's causing unnecessary harm.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But the author is choosing to maintain a boundary based on a past hurt. The question is whether that boundary is reasonable. Some might argue that not cooking is a valid way to protect their feelings, while others might think it's holding a grudge. Since the author and MIL have a good relationship otherwise, maybe moving past this one incident would be better. But if the author truly believes they need space from cooking for the MIL, that's their choice. The answer might depend on cultural expectations or family dynamics. However, in general, holding a grudge for this long could be seen as the author's fault, so maybe answer A. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again. The MIL was rude, the author's reaction is a personal choice. The author isn't being cruel, just not cooking. The husband is affected, but maybe that's part of the dynamic. I think the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to set boundaries. So answer B.\n"
