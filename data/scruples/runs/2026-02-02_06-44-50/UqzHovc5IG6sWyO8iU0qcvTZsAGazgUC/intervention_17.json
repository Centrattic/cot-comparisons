We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, leading to a strained relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The MIL didn't eat the meat, cooked it herself, and later criticized the food to the husband. The author vowed not to cook for them again and kept that vow for six years. The husband wants to move on, suggests Easter dinner, but the author is hesitant.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. So, I need to assess if holding a grudge for six years is justified. The author's reasoning is that the MIL's actions were harsh, especially since no one else had issues. The husband tried to mediate, but the MIL didn't apologize.\n\nIs the author being unreasonable? Well, the MIL's behavior was disrespectful. Publicly criticizing the food and taking the husband aside to complain could have been hurtful. The author's vow to stop cooking is a personal decision. But after six years, is it reasonable to still hold onto that? Maybe the author is holding onto past hurt, which could affect the marriage.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is trying to move forward. The author might be avoiding a potential confrontation. If the MIL hasn't noticed the change, maybe the author isn't being unfair to them. But perhaps the author is not considering the husband's feelings, as he wants to reconcile. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the MIL was definitely at fault for the initial criticism. The author's reaction is a personal choice. While holding a grudge isn't healthy, the author might feel justified. However, the husband's desire to move on might be valid. The author might be in the wrong for not making an effort to mend the relationship, even if the MIL was at fault. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because maintaining a six-year grudge might be excessive, even if the initial incident was wrong. But I need to check if the author's stance is unreasonable. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, which aligns with that.\n"
