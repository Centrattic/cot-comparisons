We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their husband built a patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the meat, asked the FIL if it was cooked, then later took it to grill more. The next day, the MIL criticized the food when visiting the husband's workplace, leading to the husband being upset. The author then decided not to cook for them anymore. Now, six years later, the husband wants to move on, and the author is considering whether to cook Easter dinner.\n\nSo, the key points here are the MIL's behavior: first, she didn't eat the food, then criticized it harshly, and the author's response was to stop cooking for them. The author is now being asked if they're in the wrong for holding a grudge this long.\n\nI need to consider what the wrong is. The author's action is not cooking for the MIL. The question is whether this is justified or if they're being unreasonable. Let's break down the MIL's actions. She didn't just politely mention the meat was undercooked; she publicly criticized the food and had to re-cook it, then later berated her son about it. That's pretty harsh. The husband was hurt, and the author didn't cook for them again as a result. \n\nNow, is holding a grudge for six years too long? Well, the author mentions that they still have a good relationship otherwise. The MIL's comment was hurtful and unapologetic, which might justify the author's anger. The author isn't cutting off the MIL entirely, just choosing not to cook for them, which is a personal boundary. The husband is now suggesting moving on, but the author is conflicted.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't doing anything illegal. Emotionally, it's a gray area. The MIL's behavior was inconsiderate and hurtful, so the author's reaction might be understandable. However, holding onto it for six years could be seen as a long time. But again, if the MIL hasn't apologized and the comment was particularly harsh, the author might feel justified.\n\nThe question is whether the author is \"in the wrong.\" If the author is being petty, maybe A. But if the MIL's actions were really that bad and the author is setting a boundary, then B. The key is whether the author's response is proportionate. The author isn't cutting off the MIL, just not cooking. Considering the MIL's actions were unkind and she didn't apologize, the author's stance might be reasonable. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
