We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's mother-in-law (MIL) criticized the food at a cookout they hosted. The MIL didn't eat the meat because she thought it wasn't cooked enough. The author's husband was told by the MIL that the food was terrible and she had to grill it herself. The husband was upset, and the author has since vowed not to cook for the in-laws again. Now, after six years, the husband wants to move on, and the author is conflicted about whether to cook for them again, like at Easter.\n\nSo, the key points here are the MIL's actions and the author's response. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding a grudge and not cooking for them anymore.\n\nFirst, the MIL's behavior seems harsh. She publicly criticized the food and made her son feel bad. That's unkind, especially since the author and husband had put effort into hosting a cookout. The MIL's actions could be seen as undermining the hosts and not showing gratitude. The husband was hurt, which is understandable.\n\nThe author's vow to never cook for them again is a personal choice. They argue that no one else had a problem with the food, just the MIL. So, from the author's perspective, the criticism was unjustified. Holding onto that for six years might seem extreme, but it's their way of coping or setting a boundary. They mention that the in-laws might not even notice the change, and their relationship otherwise is good. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, holding a grudge for six years could be seen as excessive. It might affect family dynamics if the author refuses to cook, especially if the husband is trying to mend things. However, the author isn't the one who made the hurtful comments; the MIL did. The author is responding to a past hurt, so maybe it's a form of self-respect or boundary. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. If the author's actions are causing harm or disrespect towards the in-laws, maybe. But the author isn't actively harming them; they're just not cooking. The MIL's actions were the initial wrong, so the author's response might be justified as self-protection. \n\nAlso, the husband is trying to move on, which is reasonable. The author might be choosing their battles. Since the MIL's behavior was unkind and the author's decision is a personal boundary, it's not necessarily wrong. The key is whether the author's actions are unfair compared to the MIL's original transgression. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author is responding to a past hurt and setting a boundary. The MIL was the one who caused the issue initially. The author isn't being unreasonable by not cooking, especially if the in-laws haven't noticed the absence. The husband might need to adjust his expectations, but the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
