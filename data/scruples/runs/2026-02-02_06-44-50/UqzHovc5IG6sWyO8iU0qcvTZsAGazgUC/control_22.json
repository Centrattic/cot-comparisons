We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) for an incident at a cookout several years ago. The user is asking whether they are the asshole for holding onto this grudge for six years.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the story. The author and their husband built a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked her husband if it was cooked enough, then later cooked it herself. Then, a few days later, the MIL criticized the food and told the husband she had to grill it herself, which upset him. The author decided not to cook for the MIL and FIL anymore, and now the husband wants them to move on, especially for an Easter dinner.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is wrong for not forgiving the MIL after all this time. The author's reasoning is that the MIL was the only one who criticized the food, and it's been years since the incident. The husband is pushing to move on, but the author is holding a grudge.\n\nLooking at the situation, the MIL's actions seem to have been pretty hurtful. Not only did she not eat the food initially, but then she publicly (or in a way that made the husband feel bad) criticized the cooking skills and took over grilling. The husband was hurt, which makes sense. The author's decision to stop cooking for them could be seen as a way to protect their feelings and set a boundary, especially since the MIL didn't apologize.\n\nHowever, holding onto a grudge for six years is a long time. Even if the original incident was valid, it's important to consider if the author is still justified in holding onto that anger. The author mentions that they have a good relationship with the MIL otherwise, except for this. The husband is trying to move forward, which is understandable as relationships can suffer from unresolved issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is not the one who brought up the problem initially; the MIL did. The author's response was to stop cooking, which could be seen as a reasonable boundary if the MIL's behavior was disrespectful. The author also points out that no one else had an issue with the food, so the criticism was unwarranted.\n\nBut keeping a grudge for six years might be excessive. It's possible that the author is still hurt and hasn't resolved the issue. Maybe forgiveness is needed here, not just for the husband's sake but also for their own peace of mind. However, if the MIL never apologized and the author felt it was a personal attack, then the author has a right to feel hurt. It's also possible that the author's decision to not cook is a way to avoid future potential conflicts.\n\nThe decision to cook for Easter could be a way to mend fences, but the author might not feel ready. However, the author could consider other ways to reconcile without cooking. But since the husband is involved, the author might need to find a middle ground.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, the community often looks at whether the action was reasonable and if the person's behavior is still justified. The author's initial reaction might have been justified, but holding a grudge for six years without any resolution from the MIL's side might make the author the asshole. Alternatively, if the MIL's actions were truly hurtful and there's been no change, the author's stance could be seen as valid.\n\nI think the key here is that the author is still holding onto the past without any indication that the MIL has changed or apologized. So the author's continued refusal might be seen as the problem now. Therefore, the answer might be A, that the author is in the wrong for holding onto this grudge for so long. But I'm a bit conflicted because the original incident was the MIL's fault. However, the length of time and the author's refusal to let go could be the issue now.\n"
