We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA - Am I the Asshole) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) for an incident that happened years ago during a cookout.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the story. The author and their husband built a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, asked her husband if it was cooked enough, and then later took it back to the grill. Then, a few days later, the MIL told the husband that the food was terrible and that she had to grill it herself, which upset him. The author decided not to cook for the in-laws anymore as a result. Now, the husband wants to move on and have the author cook for them at Easter, but the author is holding a grudge.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know if that's the case. The answer should be either A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No).\n\nSo, considering the facts: The MIL's actions were unkind and hurtful, but they happened six years ago. The author hasn't cooked for them since, which might be a long time. The husband is now asking to move on. The author's reasoning is that no one else had an issue with the food, just the MIL. The author also mentions that the in-laws might not even notice the change.\n\nFrom a traditional AITA perspective, people often expect some forgiveness and moving on, especially when the hurtful act was in the past and the person hasn't apologized. Holding a grudge for six years could be seen as excessive, especially if it's affecting family relations. However, the author's decision not to cook could also be a form of self-respect and setting boundaries, especially if the MIL's behavior was particularly hurtful and there was no apology. \n\nThe key factors here are the duration of the grudge, the impact on the family, and whether the author's actions are justified. The author hasn't completely cut off the in-laws, just stopped cooking, and maintains a good relationship otherwise. The husband is asking to move forward, which might indicate that the author's stance is causing some tension now.\n\nIn many AITA scenarios, holding onto past grievances without resolution can be seen as the person being in the wrong, especially if it's affecting current relationships. However, if the initial hurt was significant and there's no closure, some might argue the author is justified. But given that the incident is six years old and the author is still holding onto it, it's likely that the answer is A (they are in the wrong). The author could choose to move on and set a positive example, especially if the in-laws haven't even noticed the change, which suggests the issue might be more in the author's mind than affecting the in-laws.\n"
