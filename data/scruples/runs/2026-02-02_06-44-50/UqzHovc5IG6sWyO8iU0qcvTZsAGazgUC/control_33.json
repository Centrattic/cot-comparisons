We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again and break it down.\n\nThe author (AITA) is asking if they're the asshole for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The key event was a cookout years ago where the MIL criticized the food, even though she was the one who asked if the meat was cooked enough, then took it to the grill herself. The MIL later complained to the husband, which upset him. The author decided not to cook for them anymore, and now the husband wants them to move on, especially for Easter dinner.\n\nFirst, let's consider the initial incident. The MIL said her meat wasn't cooked enough, then took it to the grill. The author's husband was hurt when the MIL later criticized the food, expecting an apology but instead getting a repeat of the complaint. The author's vow to stop cooking for them was a reaction to this.\n\nNow, the author is holding a grudge for six years. Is that unreasonable? Well, the MIL's behavior seems inconsiderate. She didn't just say the meat wasn't cooked; she took it upon herself to re-cook it publicly while others were eating. Then, she complained to the son, which caused him emotional distress. The author's decision to stop cooking could be seen as a way to set a boundary, especially if they felt disrespected.\n\nBut the husband wants to move on. The author is conflicted. They mention that maybe the MIL didn't even notice they stopped cooking, so there's no harm done. However, the author is being asked if they're in the wrong for holding onto this resentment. \n\nOn one hand, holding a grudge for six years might seem excessive. The author might be letting a past incident affect their current relationships unnecessarily. On the other hand, the MIL's actions were disrespectful, and the author might feel justified in protecting their feelings and setting boundaries. Also, the author is not the one who initiated the conflict; the MIL did. The husband's reaction was to walk away and then confront her, but she didn't apologize. The author's vow to stop cooking is a personal choice, and if it's not affecting the relationship otherwise, maybe it's not the author's fault.\n\nHowever, the longer someone holds a grudge, the more it can be seen as a personal issue. If the author is still carrying this after six years, maybe they should consider if they're allowing past hurt to control their present. The question is whether not cooking for the MIL's family is a reasonable response. Since the author doesn't think the MIL has noticed, maybe it's not hurting anyone, but the husband wants to move forward. The author might be in the right if they feel they need boundaries, but maybe the husband is right in wanting to let go of the past.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether not cooking is a justified boundary. If the MIL's actions were truly hurtful and the author set a boundary to protect themselves, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if the author is being overly harsh and it's causing unnecessary tension with their spouse, maybe they are. The key here is that the MIL's behavior was inappropriate, so the author's reaction might be justified. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
