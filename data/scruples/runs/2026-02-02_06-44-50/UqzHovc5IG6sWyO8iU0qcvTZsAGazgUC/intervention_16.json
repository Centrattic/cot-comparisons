We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened several years ago. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their husband hosted a cookout where the MIL found the meat undercooked. She didn't eat it, took it back to grill, and later criticized the food to the husband, causing him distress. The author decided not to cook for the MIL's family again, and it's been 6 years. Now the husband wants them to move on, especially for Easter dinner.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reaction and the duration of the grudge. The incident happened years ago, and while the author hasn't cooked for them in all that time, they mention the in-laws might not even notice. The husband is pushing to move on, and the author is conflicted.\n\nI need to consider if holding a grudge for six years over a single event is justified. The initial criticism was hurtful, but the author's response is a complete cutoff of cooking for the family. The MIL's behavior was inconsiderate, but the author's long-term refusal to cook could be seen as excessive, especially since they have a good relationship otherwise. The husband's feelings were hurt, and the author's vow might not be the healthiest approach to resolve the issue. The author might be holding onto past anger, which isn't helping the relationship. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not letting go and moving past the incident. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
