We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) for a past incident where she criticized the cookout food and made the husband feel bad. The author stopped cooking for them after that and is now being asked to cook Easter dinner, but they're unsure if they should.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The MIL was the only one who didn't eat the meat, asked her husband if it was cooked enough, then went back to grill it herself. Then she later criticized the food, making the husband walk away. The author hasn't cooked for them in 6 years, even though before it was monthly. The husband wants to move on, and the author is conflicted.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key points are about forgiveness and holding a grudge. The author's action was to stop cooking, which affects their relationship. The MIL's actions were hurtful, but the author's response is a long-held vow. The question is whether holding this grudge is justified or if the author should let go.\n\nFrom the story, the author seems to be holding onto the MIL's criticism and the way she made the husband feel. However, the MIL might have had her own reasons\u2014maybe she was particular about food, or maybe her FIL's comment made her feel embarrassed. The author's decision to not cook for them could be seen as a way to protect themselves or their husband's feelings, but it's been six years. That's a long time. The husband is now asking to move on, and the author is considering whether they should comply.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the author is the one who is withholding something (cooking) from the MIL, which might affect family dynamics. The MIL's actions were hurtful, but the author's response is an ongoing issue. The story mentions that other than this, the relationships are good. The author might be right to feel hurt, but holding the grudge for so long could be seen as their fault for not resolving it. Also, the husband is caught in the middle, trying to mend the relationship. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, so I should consider if there's a valid reason for the author's stance. The author's decision to stop cooking might be a form of passive-aggressive retaliation, which can be unhealthy in a family. The MIL's behavior was unkind, but maybe the author should address the issue directly instead of avoiding it. The author's reasoning is that no one else criticized the food except the MIL, which adds to their frustration. \n\nHowever, the question is about forgiveness. The author hasn't forgiven the MIL, and the husband is pushing for reconciliation. The author is not necessarily \"in the wrong\" if they feel hurt, but the length of time and the silence might be affecting their relationship with the husband. The author could be seen as holding a grudge, but the MIL also hasn't apologized. \n\nI think the answer depends on perspective. If the author's stance is causing unnecessary conflict, then maybe they are in the wrong. But if they're protecting their own feelings and their husband's, perhaps not. The user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, so I need to see if that's a valid take. Since the author hasn't engaged with the MIL about it and just stopped cooking, this might be seen as not taking steps to resolve the issue, which could make the author responsible for the ongoing tension. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No, not in the wrong). \n\nBut the user is asking for my opinion. Considering the AITA context, where holding a grudge without communication is often frowned upon, maybe the author is in the wrong. The user's initial thought is A, so aligning with that, but I need to check if the MIL's actions were clearly the main fault. Since the MIL didn't apologize and the author's response is a personal choice, but the husband is trying to move past it, the author's refusal to cook could be seen as being in the wrong by not letting go. The key is whether forgiveness is necessary for family harmony. So, I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
