We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user, who is a wife, is asking if she's in the wrong (AITA) for not forgiving her mother-in-law (MIL). The key event was a cookout where the MIL didn't eat the meat, had her husband (FIL) check it, then later grilled it herself. Then the MIL complained to the husband about the food at the cookout and said it was terrible, even after the husband was upset and asked her to apologize. The wife then decided never to cook for the MIL again. Now, after six years, the husband wants to move on and cook an Easter dinner, but the wife is resistant. She doesn't think the MIL noticed the lack of cooking and they otherwise have a good relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the actions of all parties involved. The MIL's behavior seems to be a bit harsh. She didn't eat the food, asked for it to be cooked more, then later complained to her son about the food quality and blamed the wife for not cooking well. The husband was hurt by the MIL's comments and tried to address it, but the MIL didn't apologize. The wife took the side of her husband, which is understandable, and made a vow not to cook for them again. Now, the question is whether holding this grudge for six years is justified.\n\nFrom the wife's perspective, she feels wronged because the MIL publicly criticized the food (even though others didn't have issues) and then the MIL didn't apologize. The husband is asking her to move on, but she's holding a grudge. The user is asking if she's in the wrong for not forgiving the MIL.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about whether the wife's reaction is proportionate. The MIL's actions were indeed hurtful and ungrateful, especially since the cookout was a social event where the host's food is expected to be good. The MIL's complaint to the son and refusal to apologize could be seen as crossing a line. The wife's vow not to cook for them again is a personal choice, but holding it for six years might be seen as excessive, especially if there's no ongoing conflict and the MIL hasn't acknowledged the mistake.\n\nHowever, the wife is not in the wrong for protecting her husband's feelings and standing up for herself. The MIL's behavior was inconsiderate, so the wife's reaction is a way of setting a boundary. The fact that others didn't have issues with the food and only the MIL did could indicate that the MIL has a problem, not the cooking. The wife's decision to stop cooking for them could be a justified boundary to avoid further conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is asking to move on, which might be for the sake of family relationships. The wife's refusal to cook might be affecting the family dynamics, even if the MIL hasn't noticed. The question is whether the wife is being unreasonable by not letting go of the past. If the MIL hasn't made amends in six years, the wife's stance isn't necessarily wrong. The key factors are the initial hurt, the lack of apology, and the wife's right to set boundaries. Since the MIL hasn't shown remorse, the wife isn't wrong for not forgiving her. The answer would be B (No).\n"
