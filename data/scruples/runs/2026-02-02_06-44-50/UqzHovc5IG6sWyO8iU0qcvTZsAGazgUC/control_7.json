We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) for a past incident involving a cookout.\n\nSo, the key points here: The MIL didn't like the food at a cookout, criticized it to the husband, and the author vowed not to cook for them again. Now, the husband is pushing to move on and cook for them again, maybe for Easter. The author is considering whether they're in the wrong for holding this grudge for years.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of the author. The MIL's behavior was hurtful. She criticized the food in front of others and then told the husband how bad it was when he wasn't there. The husband was upset, and the author decided not to cook for them to avoid the hurtful situation. \n\nThe question is whether holding this grudge for six years makes the author at fault. The author's reasoning is that the MIL's actions were worse than if someone else had just mentioned their meat was undercooked. Since no one else complained, the author feels justified in their stance. The husband wants to move on, but the author is resistant. \n\nI should consider the context. The author's decision is a personal response to a hurtful event. They haven't cut off the MIL entirely, just stopped cooking for them. The MIL might not even notice the change. The author's relationship with the MIL is otherwise good, so it's not a full-blown feud.\n\nOn one hand, holding a grudge for years could be seen as stubborn or unforgiving. On the other hand, the MIL's actions were hurtful and unapologetic. The author is protecting themselves from potential hurt by avoiding a situation where they might be criticized again. \n\nAlso, the husband's role here is important. He might feel that moving on is necessary for family harmony, but the author is standing their ground. The key is whether the author's actions are justified given the circumstances. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks for fairness. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their feelings and avoiding a situation that caused past pain. The MIL's behavior was the initial problem, so the author's response is a form of self-respect. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. \n\nBut I need to make sure. The author's vow isn't affecting others except maybe the husband. The husband is okay cooking if needed. The author is within their rights to decide how they handle their relationships. So the answer is B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
