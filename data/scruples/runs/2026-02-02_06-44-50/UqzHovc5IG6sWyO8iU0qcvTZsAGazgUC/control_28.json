We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a conflict between the author and her mother-in-law (MIL) over a cookout that happened several years ago. The main points are:\n\n1. The author and her husband hosted a cookout at their new DIY patio. They invited the in-laws and others. The MIL didn't eat the food initially, then grilling it again. Later, she criticized the food at her husband's workplace, making him upset. He tried to talk to her, but she didn't apologize. The author then vowed not to cook for the MIL and FIL anymore, and has kept that promise for about six years now. Now the husband wants to move past this and have her cook Easter dinner, but she's resisting.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong for holding onto this grudge for so long. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the MIL's actions: She didn't eat the food, asked her husband if it was cooked enough (he said yes), then took it back to grill. Then later, she criticized the food in front of the author's husband, implying the food was bad and that she had to do it herself. This led the husband to feel hurt, and the author decided not to cook for them again.\n\nThe author's reasoning: The main reason for not cooking is the MIL's public criticism and the fact that no one else had a problem with the food. She feels justified in her vow. However, she's been holding this for six years, and the husband wants to move on. The author also mentions that the MIL might not even notice the absence of her cooking now.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, holding a grudge for six years seems excessive, especially if the MIL hasn't apologized. But was the author's initial reaction reasonable? The MIL's behavior was inconsiderate. She criticized the effort without direct feedback, which can be hurtful. However, the author's punishment (not cooking for them for years) is a long time. The husband is caught in the middle, trying to reconcile.\n\nOn one hand, it's understandable that the author felt hurt by the MIL's actions and wanted to protect her self-esteem by not cooking for them anymore. On the other hand, holding onto that anger for years without resolution might be harmful to the family dynamics. The author is not in a position of needing to forgive, but maybe the length of time is the issue here. The question is whether the author is justified in her stance.\n\nThe concept of forgiveness is complex. If the MIL never apologized, the author might not feel obligated to forgive. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If she's choosing to hold onto the grievance, maybe it's not her fault, but is she wrong in her choice to not forgive? In many cases, holding onto grudges can be seen as harmful to oneself and relationships, even if the initial wrongdoing was valid.\n\nIn the context of the story, the author's main issue is the public criticism and lack of apology. The husband is trying to move on, but the author is standing her ground. Since the MIL hasn't apologized and the author feels justified in her stance, maybe she isn't in the wrong. However, the question is whether she is in the wrong for not forgiving. If forgiveness is a choice, and the author has made that choice, then she isn't necessarily in the wrong. But if the situation is causing unnecessary harm and the husband is trying to mend things, maybe the author is being unreasonable.\n\nBut the story says that the author's husband is trying to move on, and she's willing to let him cook, but he can't. So the author's main stance is about the cooking. If the MIL hasn't noticed the absence of her cooking, maybe the author isn't causing any harm by continuing her vow. The author also mentions that she has a good relationship with the MIL otherwise. So maybe she's not in the wrong. The key points are that the MIL's actions were hurtful, the author's response was to stop cooking, which is a personal choice, and the husband is trying to reconcile.\n\nIn terms of the AITA framework, the answer would likely be B (No), meaning the author isn't in the wrong. Her reaction was a personal choice in response to a hurtful situation, and if the other party hasn't apologized, holding onto the grievance isn't necessarily wrong, even if it's a long time. The author is entitled to set boundaries based on her experience. However, it's also important to consider the impact on the family, but the story suggests that the author isn't causing harm and that the MIL might not even notice. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
