We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened six years ago. The situation involves a cookout where the MIL criticized the food, leading to tension with the husband.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and their husband built a patio and hosted a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the meat and later grilled it herself. Then, days later, the MIL told the husband the food was terrible, which upset him. The author decided not to cook for the in-laws anymore, and now the husband wants them to move on, suggesting cooking an Easter dinner. The author is conflicted, not sure if holding this grudge is justified.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down. The MIL's behavior seems critical and possibly overbearing. She didn't eat the food initially, then took it upon herself to re-cook it in front of others. Then, after the event, she criticized the food to the husband, which caused him emotional distress. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which has lasted six years.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel hurt by the MIL's public criticism and the fact that no one else had a problem with the food. The vow to not cook again could be a way to set a boundary, especially since the MIL didn't apologize. The author might believe they're justified in their stance because the MIL's actions were disrespectful, and the husband's reaction showed that the criticism was hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, holding a grudge for six years could be seen as excessive. The author mentions that the in-laws might not even notice the change, and the relationship is otherwise good. The husband is encouraging moving on, which suggests he values forgiveness and maintaining a positive relationship. Cooking for them again, even if grudgingly, might be a way to heal and show maturity.\n\nBut the author's decision is also about respecting their own feelings. If the MIL never apologized and the author still feels resentment, it's understandable to want to avoid situations that trigger those feelings. The key here is whether the author's actions are a reasonable response given the circumstances.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the MIL's behavior was unkind and disrespectful. The author's boundary\u2014stopping cooking\u2014could be a form of self-protection. However, after six years, the question is about forgiveness and letting go of past hurts for the sake of family relations. The author might be right in holding onto the grudge if they feel it's necessary for their peace of mind, but it's also possible that the husband's perspective is valid in wanting to move forward.\n\nThe answer depends on whether the author's stance is seen as justified or overly rigid. Since the MIL didn't apologize, and the author's husband was hurt, the author's decision to not cook again isn't necessarily wrong. The act of forgiveness can be personal and varies by individual. If the author chooses to cook for them out of obligation without genuine reconciliation, that might not be healthy either.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong), as the author's decision to set a boundary in response to disrespectful behavior is understandable. However, it's a nuanced situation where both perspectives have merits.\n"
