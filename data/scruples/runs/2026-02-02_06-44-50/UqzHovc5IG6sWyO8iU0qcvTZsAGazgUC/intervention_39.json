We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident that happened years ago. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their husband hosted a cookout where the MIL initially didn't eat the meat, then later re-cooked it. Then, a few days later, the MIL criticized the food to the husband and didn't apologize. The author then vowed not to cook for the MIL anymore, and it's been six years. The husband now wants to move on, but the author refuses to cook again.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong for holding this grudge?\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the MIL's actions were rude and hurtful. Publicly criticizing the food and making the husband feel bad is not ideal. The author's husband was upset, and the MIL didn't apologize, which is a breach of etiquette. The author's decision to stop cooking could be seen as a justified self-defense to avoid further conflict and to set a boundary. It's been six years, and the author hasn't cooked for them, but maybe no one noticed. \n\nOn the other hand, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive. The author is choosing to maintain a grudge over an event that others might have forgotten or downplayed. The MIL might not even remember the incident after all these years. The author's husband is trying to move on, and the author's refusal could be causing ongoing tension in their marriage. Also, the author mentions that the rest of the relationship with the MIL is good, so maybe letting go of this issue could strengthen family bonds.\n\nHowever, the author's stance is about respecting their own feelings and boundaries. If the author still feels hurt and doesn't want to cook for the MIL, it's their right to set that boundary. The key here is whether holding onto the grudge is harmful. Since the author hasn't cooked for them and it's not causing current issues (since the MIL might not notice), maybe it's not the author's fault. \n\nBut the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If the author's actions (not cooking) are causing harm or unnecessary conflict, then maybe they are in the wrong. However, the author is not in a position where they have to cook; it's a personal choice. The husband is willing to cook, but the author is okay with that. So, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to cook. \n\nIn terms of social norms, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as overly harsh, but people have different thresholds for forgiveness. The author's reasoning is valid if they still feel the need to protect their feelings. So, the answer might be B (No), because the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their emotional well-being and setting boundaries, even if the grudge is long-held.\n"
