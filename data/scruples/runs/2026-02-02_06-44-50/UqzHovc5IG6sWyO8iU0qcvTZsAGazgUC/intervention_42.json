We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a cookout where the MIL was critical of the food, even though others were happy with it. The author hasn't cooked for them since, and now the husband wants to move past it. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want to know what I think.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The cookout was an event where the MIL didn't eat the food and instead took it back to grill more. Then, after a few days, she criticized the food when visiting the husband's workplace, which upset him. The author then decided not to cook for them anymore, which has lasted six years. Now the husband wants to move on, and the author is considering if they should cook Easter dinner this year.\n\nThe key points here are: The MIL's actions were out of line, especially taking the situation to the husband privately and being critical. The author's response was to cut off cooking for them, which is a personal choice. The husband is now advocating for moving past it, and the author is wondering if it's their fault (AITA).\n\nI should consider the context of family dynamics and the nature of the conflict. The MIL's criticism was harsh and publicized, as she made the husband walk away. The author's vow not to cook for them was a result of feeling disrespected and hurt. However, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive, but it's not clear if the MIL apologized. The author's husband is in the middle and wants reconciliation, which is understandable in a marriage.\n\nThe question is if the author is in the wrong. If the MIL did not apologize and the author found a way to set a boundary (not cooking) that hasn't affected the family's interactions, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. But the husband's perspective is important too. The author might be harming the marital relationship by not letting go of the past, which could be their fault. On the other hand, the MIL's behavior was disrespectful and unappreciative, so refusing to cook could be justified.\n\nI need to weigh the pros and cons. The author's action is a personal boundary, which is okay if it's to protect their own feelings. But if the husband is now asking to move on, the author's refusal might be causing unnecessary strain. The answer could be a mix, but since the user is asking for a choice between A (yes) and B (no), I have to decide. The MIL's actions were inappropriate, but the author's response over six years is a long time. Maybe the author is not in the wrong because the MIL didn't show remorse, and the author is standing up for themselves. But some might argue that holding a grudge is not good. However, the author is using their own cooking skills as a boundary, which is a reasonable way to address the hurt. Since the husband is suggesting moving on, but the author is choosing not to cook, it's more about personal choice rather than being in the wrong. So maybe the answer is B (No).\n"
