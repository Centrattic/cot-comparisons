We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL) after an incident involving a cookout several years ago.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and husband built a DIY patio and had a cookout. The MIL didn't eat the food, then later criticized it harshly to the husband, leading to hurt feelings. The author decided not to cook for them again, which they've upheld for six years. Now the husband wants to move on, but the author is resisting. The question is whether the author is wrong for holding onto this grudge.\n\nI need to consider the key points here. The MIL's actions were inconsiderate\u2014publicly criticizing the food and making the husband feel bad. The author's response was to stop cooking for them, which seems like a long-held grudge. The husband is trying to move forward, but the author is resistant. \n\nOn one hand, the MIL's behavior was inappropriate. She didn't like the meat's doneness, which is a personal preference, but taking it upon herself to cook it again and then later criticizing the food and the cookout, implying the food was terrible and making the husband feel bad. That's pretty harsh and could be seen as rude and inconsiderate. The author's vow not to cook for them again is a form of punishment, which might be justified if the MIL apologized and then didn't, but it's been six years. Holding a grudge for that long might not be healthy, especially if the author's husband wants to move on. \n\nOn the other hand, the author feels justified because no one else had a problem with the food. The MIL was the only one who criticized it, and the author is still holding resentment over it. The author's husband is trying to reconcile, but the author is reluctant. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not forgiving.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the key is whether the initial action (the MIL's criticism) was more in the wrong than the author's response. The MIL's behavior was definitely inconsiderate and hurtful. The author's response is a personal choice, but holding a grudge for six years without the other party showing remorse might be seen as excessive. However, the author's feelings are valid, and forgiveness isn't mandatory. \n\nBut the husband is caught in the middle, wanting to reconcile and move forward. The author's refusal to cook might be affecting their marital relationship. So, while the author's feelings are understandable, refusing to move on might be impacting their husband's ability to reconcile with his parents, which could be seen as being in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, if the author is not the one causing the rift but is instead a victim of the MIL's actions, then they might not be in the wrong. However, by holding onto the grudge, they are maintaining the tension. Whether that's their fault or not depends on societal expectations of forgiveness and moving on.\n\nIn many AITA scenarios, holding a grudge without the other party showing remorse is seen as the person's fault, but if they have valid reasons and are not the initial wrongdoer, it's not necessarily their fault. The MIL was the one who was rude, so the author isn't at fault for being upset. But holding a grudge for six years without any attempt at reconciliation from the MIL's side might make the author's stance seem a bit harsh, but not entirely wrong. \n\nThe husband is also part of the dynamic here. He's trying to move on, but the author is resistant. The husband's reaction to his parents was immediate\u2014he called them and expressed his hurt. The MIL didn't apologize, so the author is still mad. If the author is still holding onto the grudge despite the husband's efforts to move past it, maybe the author is in the wrong for not letting go, especially if the husband is trying to mend the relationship. \n\nBut the author's vow is a personal boundary. They might feel that cooking is a way to show respect or maintain a relationship, and if the MIL is still unapologetic, setting that boundary is their choice. However, if the author is using this as a way to punish the MIL and their husband without considering the husband's wishes, that could be seen as inconsiderate of his needs. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not letting go and for not allowing their husband to reconcile with his parents, especially if the author's refusal is affecting their marriage more than it's affecting the MIL's feelings. The author is holding onto the past, which could be seen as unfair to their husband. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
