We finished it just before Labor Day and decided to have a patio opening cookout. We invited his parents, my parents, and his brother and SIL. When the food was served everyone was chowing down except my MIL. She asked my FIL if her meat looked cooked enough. He said it was. She put it down and didn't eat it. Eventually she took it back to the grill and cooked it some more while everyone else was eating and enjoying themselves. No big deal right?\nA few days later my in-laws dropped by my husband's work to give him something. MIL took the opportunity to take him aside and tell him how terrible the food at the cookout had been and that she couldn't believe she had to grill it herself. My husband got so upset he had to walk away from them. He called her later that day to tell her how hurt he was by what she'd said, but rather than apologize she reiterated that the food was awful. When my husband told me all this I vowed that I would never cook a meal for them again (prior to this we had them over for dinner on a monthly or so basis). Now I wouldn't be so mad if anyone else had said their meat was still pink in the middle but no one did. \nFlash forward 6 or so years, I can't even remember exactly, and I have kept my vow. But my husband says it's time to move on. I told him he is welcome to cook for them but other than grilling he's no cook. So AITA for holding this for so many years? Should I do like he wants and cook an Easter dinner this year? I honestly don't even think they've noticed that I haven't cooked for them in years, so it's not like their feelings are being hurt. Other than this I have a good relationship with them. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not forgiving their mother-in-law (MIL). The situation involves a cookout where the MIL was critical of the food, leading to the author vowing not to cook for them again. Now, the husband wants to move on, and the author is considering whether they should cook for them again.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's MIL was unreasonably critical of the food, even though others didn't have issues. The MIL even took the meat back to the grill, which the author found unnecessary. Then, the MIL later complained to the husband, which hurt him, and the author decided not to cook for them again. Now, after six years, the husband wants the author to cook again, but the author is reluctant.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. So, I need to weigh the arguments from both sides. On one hand, the MIL's actions were inconsiderate and hurtful. She publicly criticized the food and then later made the husband feel bad by her comments. The author's reaction of cutting off cooking for them might be a way to set a boundary, which could be justified if the MIL's behavior was toxic or disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, holding a grudge for six years might be seen as excessive. The author mentions that they have a good relationship with the MIL otherwise. If the author is still holding onto this past incident without any resolution, it might affect their family dynamics. The husband is trying to move past it, which could be important for family harmony. Also, the author's decision not to cook might be seen as punishing the MIL and the husband for an old issue, especially if the MIL hasn't apologized or changed her behavior.\n\nI should consider cultural norms around forgiveness and family relationships. In many cases, holding onto past grievances, even if justified, can lead to long-term resentment. The author might be within their rights to set boundaries, but the length of time and the impact on the current relationship could be factors. The author's reason for not cooking is understandable, but the effect on the husband and the potential for reconciliation might tip the scales. The question is whether the author's actions are fair given the circumstances. If the MIL hasn't acknowledged the wrong, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the author is maintaining a grudge without a constructive approach, maybe they are. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the MIL's actions were inconsiderate, and the author's response was a personal boundary. But maybe the six-year duration is an issue. Hmm. The answer might be A or B. The user thinks A (author is in the wrong), but I need to decide.\n"
