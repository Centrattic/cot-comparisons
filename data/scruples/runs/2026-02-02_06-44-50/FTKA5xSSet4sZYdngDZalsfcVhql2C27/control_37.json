He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that they live with their best friend who doesn't pay rent or bills, doesn't pay for groceries, and uses the author's car. The friend also wants a portion of the author's meals every time they eat, and the author usually gives in after the friend stares at them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is covering all the costs for living expenses, including groceries. However, the friend isn't contributing financially. Now, when it comes to sharing food, the friend is always asking for a portion, but the author is only ensuring there's enough food, not necessarily the same type. The friend uses passive-aggressive tactics like staring to get their way.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to share their food. Let's break it down. If the author is already providing enough food for two, but the friend is taking from the shared groceries, maybe the expectation is that the food is communal. However, the author mentions that it's not always the same type of food, which might mean they prepare different meals. If they buy ingredients for both, but cook separate dishes (like one vegetarian and one non-veg), the friend might be taking from the author's specific meal rather than the shared groceries.\n\nIn that case, the author isn't obligated to share their prepared meal if it's not part of the shared groceries. The friend's behavior of staring until the author complies is manipulative and disrespectful. The author is setting boundaries by sometimes not giving in, which is reasonable. The friend's lack of contribution to bills and groceries adds to the imbalance, making the author's stance more understandable.\n\nSo, considering all points, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend isn't contributing financially and is being passive-aggressive about sharing meals. The author is justified in not sharing their prepared food if it's not part of the shared groceries. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
