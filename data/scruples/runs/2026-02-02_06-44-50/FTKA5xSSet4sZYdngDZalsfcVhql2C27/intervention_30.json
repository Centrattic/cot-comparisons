He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or contribute to groceries, and takes the author's meals sometimes by staring at them until they give in. The author is conflicted because they put up with other issues like the friend being loud, dirty, and smelly because they're friends, but this food-sharing thing is causing tension.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend lives for free, uses the author's car, and doesn't pay for groceries. The author makes sure there's enough food for both, but the friend wants the same type of food. The key point is whether it's reasonable to share every meal. \n\nThe author is not in the wrong if they set boundaries. It's their home, and they have the right to decide how they use their own food. The friend's behavior of staring until they give in could be manipulative. Also, the friend isn't contributing to the household expenses, which might affect how responsibilities are shared. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have communicated better. But the friend isn't respecting the author's autonomy in food choices. The author is trying to be considerate by ensuring there's enough food, but the friend wants the same type, which isn't necessary if there's enough quantity. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing their specific meals. The friend's behavior is more problematic. So the answer is B.\n"
