He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The writer and their friend live together. The friend doesn't pay rent or groceries, uses the writer's car, and is described as loud, messy, and smelly. The main issue is that the friend often takes a portion of the writer's meal by staring until the writer gives in. The writer is conflicted about this and the friend doesn't have their own food, but the writer ensures there's enough food for both, even if not the same type.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries and fairness. The writer is covering all expenses, and the friend isn't contributing financially. The friend's behavior of taking food without asking could be seen as taking advantage. The writer is tired of giving in and wants to stop, which makes sense because they're the one paying for everything. \n\nBut is the writer in the wrong? Well, if the friend is relying on the writer to provide food because they can't afford it themselves, then the writer might feel they're being taken advantage of. However, the writer mentions that they ensure there's enough food for both. So maybe the issue is about the friend's non-verbal pressure to share when the writer is making sure they have food. The friend might not realize that the writer isn't obligated to share their meal, even if there's enough food in the house.\n\nAlternatively, if the writer is the one cooking and the friend is just taking a portion, that's different from the friend not having any food at all. The writer might be overextending by constantly sharing their own meal, especially if they're the one covering all costs. The friend's lack of contribution (rent, bills, groceries) is a red flag here. The writer is the one providing everything, so the friend's entitlement to shared meals could be seen as unfair.\n\nOn the other hand, if the writer is making enough food for both, maybe the friend isn't actually in need, but just wants to take a portion regardless. The writer has the right to set boundaries, especially if they're the one paying for everything. The friend's behavior of staring until compliance is manipulative. \n\nSo, considering all that, the writer isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. They're the one covering costs, and the friend isn't contributing. The writer should have the right to decide how they want to handle their meals without pressure. The friend's actions are the ones that are problematic here. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
