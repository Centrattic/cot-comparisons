He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, the author covers everything. The friend is loud, messy, smelly, but the author tolerates it because they're friends. Now, the friend keeps asking for portions of the author's meals, even though there's supposedly enough food. The author says they usually give in but sometimes don't. The friend just stares until they do, which seems a bit passive-aggressive.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for not sharing. Let's look at the key points. The author is the one providing all the resources, including food. The friend isn't contributing financially. The author is setting boundaries by sometimes not sharing, which the friend pressures them to change. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, mutual respect and fair contributions are important. Since the friend isn't contributing, expecting the author to constantly share might be unfair. Also, the author is making sure there's enough food for both, even if it's different types. So, the author isn't being stingy; they're managing their resources. The friend's behavior\u2014staring until they give in\u2014sounds like manipulation. \n\nThe author's right to set boundaries is important. If the friend is making them uncomfortable with their demands, then not sharing sometimes is justified. Plus, considering the friend's other habits (loud, dirty), the author might be dealing with a lot already. Insisting on sharing every meal could add more stress without reciprocal effort from the friend.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're maintaining their limits in a situation where the friend isn't contributing as a roommate should. The friend's expectations might not be reasonable given the lack of financial support and other disrespectful behaviors. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
