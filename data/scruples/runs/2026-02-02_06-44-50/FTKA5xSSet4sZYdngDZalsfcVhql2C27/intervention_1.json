He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that the friend lives with the author but doesn't pay any bills or contribute to groceries. The friend also uses the author's car and sometimes acts dirty or loud. However, the main issue is the friend taking portions of the author's meals when they eat.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend doesn't outright ask but stares until the author gives in. The user initially thinks the author is wrong but is seeking opinions. \n\nI need to consider if the author is responsible for sharing their food. Since the friend isn't contributing financially, maybe the author isn't obligated to share. The friend's behavior of staring and expecting food without asking could be seen as disrespectful. The author might be setting boundaries by not sharing, which is their right. However, the friend's actions might be problematic too. If the friend is taking without asking, that's an issue. The author's compromise of sometimes giving in might be why the friend continues. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is making enough food for both, maybe they are sharing, but the friend is taking more than their share. Alternatively, if the author is not required to share their personal meal (like if they paid for it), then not sharing isn't wrong. Since the friend is taking without asking, the author might be justified in not giving in. The fact that the friend doesn't contribute financially adds to the author's burden. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong; the friend's actions are more the issue. So the answer would be B.\n"
