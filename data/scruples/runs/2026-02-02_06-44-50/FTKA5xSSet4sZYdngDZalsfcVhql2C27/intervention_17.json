He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that the friend lives with them for free, doesn't pay bills or groceries, and relies on the author for transportation. The friend often wants a portion of the author's meal but doesn't outright ask, just stares until the author gives in.\n\nFirst, the author makes it clear that they make sure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. So maybe the meals are different, but the friend still wants a share. The author usually gives in but is now considering not sharing.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The friend isn't contributing financially, so the author might be shouldering all responsibilities. However, the friend is their best friend, and they tolerate other issues like being loud and dirty. The food sharing seems to be a point of contention here.\n\nThe key question is whether the friend has a right to expect free meals from the author. Since the friend isn't paying for groceries, maybe the author isn't obligated to share their food. The friend's behavior of staring and not asking directly could be seen as manipulative. The author is making an effort to provide food, but the friend's constant requests might be crossing a line.\n\nSo, if the author is providing enough food for both, but the friend still wants portions of what the author is eating, the author might be within their rights to set boundaries. The friend's lack of contribution to the household (no bills, groceries, car) might mean they aren't entitled to the same meals. The author has been accommodating, but it's reasonable for them to say no if they feel it's unfair.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is making sure there's enough for both, maybe the friend is just being greedy. The author isn't forced to share their specific meal, especially if they cooked it for themselves. The friend might be taking advantage of the situation where they don't contribute. \n\nSo, considering the friend's lack of financial contribution and the author's responsibilities, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The friend's behavior is more inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
