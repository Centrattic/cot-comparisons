He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is at fault for not sharing food with their best friend. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author and their best friend live together. The friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries and uses the author's car. The friend is sometimes loud and messy but the author tolerates it because they're friends. Now, the issue is that the friend often wants a portion of the author's meal. The author says they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend doesn't ask but stares until the author complies. The author is questioning if they're wrong for not sharing.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the core of the problem. Sharing food is a common issue in shared living situations. The key points here are the friend's lack of contribution and the pressure to share despite the author's efforts to provide. The author mentions that they ensure there's enough food for both, implying that the friend isn't left without food. However, the friend is pressuring the author to share their specific meals, which the author is now resisting.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about boundaries and mutual respect. The friend isn't contributing financially, which is a significant factor. The author is covering all costs but is expected to share their personal portions. The friend using passive-aggressive tactics (staring) to get what they want might indicate a lack of respect for the author's autonomy. The author's decision to say no could be a necessary step in setting boundaries, especially since the friend isn't contributing equally. \n\nHowever, some might argue that friendship includes sharing, but in this case, the imbalance in contributions (no bills, no groceries) complicates things. The author is trying to maintain the friendship while also managing their own resources. The key here is that the author isn't denying the friend food entirely, just their specific meals, which they make an effort to provide for. The friend's behavior of pressuring might be the real issue here, not the author's refusal.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're asserting their right to not share when they don't want to, especially given the friend's lack of contribution. The problem might lie more with the friend's expectations and behavior.\n"
