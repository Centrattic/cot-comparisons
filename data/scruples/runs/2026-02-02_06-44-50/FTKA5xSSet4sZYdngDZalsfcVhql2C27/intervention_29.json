He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author lives with their best friend who doesn't pay bills or groceries, and the friend keeps wanting portions of the author's meals. The author usually gives in. The user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend doesn't contribute financially, so the author is covering all the costs. Now, the issue is sharing food. The author says they make sure there's enough food for both, but maybe not the same type. The friend isn't asking for food they haven't provided, but taking from the author's meal. \n\nIs it fair for the author to be expected to share their own food? If the friend is contributing nothing, maybe it's reasonable to set boundaries. The author might be overextending by constantly giving in. The friend's behavior of staring until getting the food could be manipulative. The author might have the right to keep their own meal, especially since they're covering all expenses. \n\nBut then, they're best friends. Maybe the author has been used to sharing, but now it's becoming a problem. The key is whether the author is being taken advantage of. If the friend isn't contributing and is getting free food from the author's meals, that's an imbalance. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and not sharing if they choose. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their own food, and the friend isn't contributing his share. The author should be able to decide how to use their own food without pressure.\n"
