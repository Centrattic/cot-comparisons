He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that the friend lives with them, doesn't pay bills or groceries, uses their car, and sometimes is loud, dirty, and smelly. The main issue is when the friend takes a portion of the author's meal without directly asking, just by staring until the author gives in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend lives there for free and doesn't contribute to expenses. That already sets up a dynamic where the author is shouldering all the costs. The friend's behavior of taking food without being direct could be seen as taking advantage. The author is making sure there's enough food, but not necessarily the same type. So maybe the friend is taking the same type as the author's meal, which the author might not want to share.\n\nThe key points here are boundaries and respect. If the friend is taking portions without being asked and using a stare to pressure the author, that's not respectful of the author's autonomy over their food. The author is setting a boundary by not always giving in. The fact that the author usually gives in but not always suggests that the friend's approach is manipulative. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting their own meal choice. It's a shared living situation, but personal belongings and meals should be respected unless there's an agreement otherwise. The friend's actions seem entitled, so the author isn't at fault for not sharing.\n"
