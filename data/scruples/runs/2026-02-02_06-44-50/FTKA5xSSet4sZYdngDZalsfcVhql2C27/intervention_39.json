He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation described is that the author and their friend live together, but the friend doesn't pay for anything\u2014no bills, groceries, car, and the author takes care of all of that. The friend is loud, messy, and smelly, but the author puts up with it because they're best friends. The main issue is that the friend keeps asking for portions of the author's meals, even though there's enough food available, just not the same type. The author sometimes gives in but now is considering not sharing anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know the community's opinion. The possible answers are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nLet me break it down. The key points here are about shared living responsibilities, expectations, and boundaries. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might be a big issue. The author is providing for all expenses but is being asked to share their personal meals, which they're not comfortable with anymore. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in suggests some pressure. \n\nI think the main factors here are consent and boundary setting. The author is the one who prepared the meal, so it's their property. The friend's request to share isn't a right unless there's a prior agreement. Even though there's enough food, the author might be tired of giving in. The fact that the friend isn't contributing to the household could mean the author is being taken advantage of, but that's separate from the immediate issue of sharing food. \n\nThe author has the right to set boundaries, especially if they're not comfortable with sharing. However, the friend might feel entitled because of their friendship, but entitlement isn't a valid reason. The author isn't obligated to share their personal meals unless it's part of an agreement they made. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing. The problem might be better resolved through communication, but the act of not sharing isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
