He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story did something wrong by not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, uses the author's car, but the author doesn't think they're in the wrong for not sharing food each time.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend lives for free, doesn't contribute to any costs, and the author provides transportation. However, the author is not willing to share their specific meals, even though they ensure there's enough food available, just maybe not the same type. The friend uses a staring tactic to get a portion, and the author usually gives in but is now questioning if they should continue.\n\nThe author's responsibility here is a bit of a gray area. On one hand, they mention they always make sure there's enough food for both, so maybe the friend isn't actually in a situation where they don't have food. The problem is the friend wants the same type of food the author is having. The author is not obligated to share every single meal, especially if they're not in a shared financial arrangement. The friend's behavior of staring and expecting a share without direct asking might be manipulative or take advantage of the author's generosity. \n\nBut the other side is that they are best friends and live together. Sometimes, in close relationships, people expect a certain level of support, even if it's not fair. The author is balancing putting up with other issues (loudness, being dirty) because of their friendship. However, the act of not sharing food isn't inherently wrong if the friend has their own food. The author is setting a boundary, which is okay. The friend's expectation to get a portion might be unreasonable unless they're contributing to the shared living costs. \n\nSo, if the author is providing meals but not required to, and the friend is taking without contributing, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing. However, if the friend is relying on the author for all their food, then maybe the author is in a position where they should address the imbalance more broadly. But based on the information given, the author is not in the wrong for not sharing their specific meals when they choose to set that boundary. The friend's behavior is questionable, but the author has the right to decide how to handle their own food. So the answer is B for No.\n"
