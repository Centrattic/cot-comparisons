He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, relies on the author for transportation, and sometimes is loud, dirty, and smelly. The main issue is the friend wanting a portion of the author's meals every time they eat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is the one handling all the expenses, which is a big responsibility. They mention making sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend doesn't directly ask but uses a stare to get the author to give in. The author usually complies but now questions if it's right not to share.\n\nI should think about boundaries in friendships, especially when one person is shouldering all costs. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might be a bigger issue than the food sharing. The author is setting a boundary by not sharing, which could be necessary for their own well-being. However, the friend's behavior of staring might be seen as manipulative, but the author has the right to refuse. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend is a guest in a way, but since they live together, it's a shared living arrangement. The author might feel overburdened. The key points are the unequal contribution and the friend's entitlement. The author isn't wrong for asserting their needs. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
