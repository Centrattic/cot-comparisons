He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The friend doesn't pay any bills, groceries, or contribute to the household, and yet the friend expects a portion of the author's meals. The author feels they've been accommodating up to this point but is now conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their living situation. The friend is living rent-free and not contributing financially in any way. The author is covering all the costs, including groceries, and even driving them places. That's a lot to take on. Now, when it comes to sharing meals, the friend just stares until the author gives in. The author is questioning if they're right to not share now.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the friend is contributing nothing to the household, it's reasonable for the author to set boundaries. The author is providing for the friend's basic needs (food, shelter), but the friend isn't reciprocating. Sharing food is a personal choice, but if the friend isn't paying their share, the author isn't obligated to give them portions every time. The friend's behavior of staring until the author complies might be seen as manipulative or taking advantage.\n\nHowever, the author mentions that there's always enough food for both, even if not the same type. So maybe the author is already ensuring the friend has access to food. If the friend is just wanting a portion of the author's specific meal, it's a different matter. The author might be within their rights to decline, especially since the friend isn't contributing. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that since they're close friends living together, sharing food is part of the social contract. But given that the friend isn't contributing financially, the author's stance could be justified. It's about mutual respect and contributing to shared responsibilities. If the friend isn't pulling their weight, the author has the right to prioritize their own needs and set boundaries.\n\nSo, in this case, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing. They've been making sacrifices already, and the friend's demands without reciprocity are unfair. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
