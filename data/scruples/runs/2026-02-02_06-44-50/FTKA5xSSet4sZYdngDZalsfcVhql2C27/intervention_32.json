He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, and the friend often takes a portion of the author's meal. The author says they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend just stares until the author gives in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might be a point in the author's favor. But they are friends, and the author mentions they put up with other things like noise and mess. The main issue is sharing food.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong. The user who commented thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to decide between A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFrom the description, the author is providing enough food, just not the same type. Maybe the meals are different but sufficient. The friend is taking without asking, which could be seen as taking advantage. However, in a friendship where the author is already making sacrifices (no payment, driving, putting up with other issues), the friend's behavior might be crossing a line.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is the one who usually gives in, so maybe they feel obligated. If the friend isn't contributing, expecting shared meals might be unreasonable. The author has boundaries about their own food, even if it's different from the friend's. The friend's non-verbal pressure (staring) could be manipulative.\n\nI think the key here is that the author is setting limits by not sharing. Since the friend isn't contributing, the author isn't obligated to share their specific meals. The friend's behavior of taking without asking and using pressure tactics isn't fair. So the author is in the right to say no. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
