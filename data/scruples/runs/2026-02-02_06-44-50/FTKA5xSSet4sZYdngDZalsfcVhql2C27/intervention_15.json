He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their friend. The friend lives with them but doesn't pay bills or groceries. The author takes them everywhere too.\n\nSo the main issue is the friend wanting a portion of the author's meal every time they eat. The author says they make sure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. The friend just stares until the author gives in, which they usually do. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend isn't contributing financially. They're living for free, which might mean they rely on the author for more than just food. But the author is setting a boundary by not sharing their meal, even if they sometimes give in. \n\nIs it right to share food when the other person isn't contributing? Well, the author mentions they make sure there's enough food for both. So maybe they're providing for the friend's meals in general, but the friend is now taking portions from the author's specific meals. That could be seen as taking without asking, especially if the author is preparing different things. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author is cooking and making sure there's enough, perhaps the friend expects to have a say in what they eat. But the author might feel that their own meal is their own choice. The staring and pressuring the author to give in could be a problem. The author might feel forced into sharing even when they don't want to. \n\nThe key points are mutual respect and boundaries. If the friend isn't contributing financially, maybe the author shouldn't have to share every meal. Also, the friend's behavior of staring until they get what they want is a form of passive-aggressive pressure. The author might be within their rights to say no sometimes. \n\nBut maybe the author is being too strict. If they usually give in, maybe they should be consistent. Or if they're tired of giving in, it's okay to set a boundary. It's about communication. The author might not be in the wrong if they're standing up for their own needs, especially since the friend isn't contributing. \n\nAlternatively, if the author is providing for the friend's meals in general, maybe sharing a portion isn't a big deal. But the author is making exceptions with the same types of food. So the friend might be taking advantage. \n\nSo considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to set boundaries, especially when the friend isn't contributing. The friend's behavior is problematic, so the author isn't wrong for not always sharing. Answer B.\n"
