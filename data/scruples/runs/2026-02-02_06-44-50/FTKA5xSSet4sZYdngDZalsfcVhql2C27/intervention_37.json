He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that the friend lives with them, doesn't pay any bills, doesn't contribute to groceries, and relies on the author for transportation and food. The friend often wants a portion of the author's meal, sometimes just staring until the author gives in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend is living for free and not contributing to household expenses, which might already be a point of contention. The author mentions they make sure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. The friend is asking for a portion of the author's meal, maybe expecting sharing. The author is conflicted about this and sometimes gives in.\n\nThe key points are: the friend's lack of contribution, the author's provision of food, and the friend's expectation of sharing meals. The author is questioning if they're at fault for not sharing. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the friend isn't contributing to groceries, expecting the author to share their meal might be unreasonable. The author is already ensuring there's enough food available, so the friend's request could be seen as exploiting the situation. However, since they're friends, social norms might expect some sharing, but that's complicated by the imbalance in contributions.\n\nThe author's perspective is that they're putting up with the friend's shortcomings (loudness, messiness) because of their friendship. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in seems manipulative, which could make the author feel pressured. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have set boundaries earlier. If the friend is used to getting food without contributing, the author might have enabled this by giving in. But the friend's lack of contribution to bills and groceries is a bigger issue here. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author is providing food for both and the friend isn't contributing, then the friend's expectation to share the meal might be unfair. The author isn't obligated to share their personal portion, especially if they're covering all the costs. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing, making the answer B.\n"
