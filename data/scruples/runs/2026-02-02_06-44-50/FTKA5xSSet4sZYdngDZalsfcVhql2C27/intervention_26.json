He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend who lives with them. The friend doesn't pay any bills, groceries, or have a car, and the author takes care of all that. The friend sometimes acts loud and messy, but the author tolerates it because they're friends. The main issue is that the friend wants a portion of the author's meal, which the author sometimes gives in to. The author is now wondering if they're in the wrong for not sharing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend is living rent-free and doesn't contribute to expenses. That's a big factor. The author is shouldering all the financial responsibilities, which includes groceries. If the friend is not contributing to groceries, then the food in the house isn't entirely theirs to share. The author might have made sure there's enough food for both, but that doesn't necessarily mean they have to share their own prepared meals every time. \n\nThe friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in could be a form of passive pressure. The author might feel obligated to comply even if they don't want to. However, the friend is not paying for groceries, so maybe the author isn't obligated to share their meals. On the other hand, the author is the one providing the meals, so they might have the right to choose what they eat. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the friend is not contributing financially and is expecting to share the author's meals, then the author might not be in the wrong for setting boundaries. The author is already doing a lot by covering all expenses and providing food. It's reasonable for them to want to keep their own meals to themselves sometimes without feeling pressured. \n\nHowever, the author does mention that they usually give in, which implies that they might feel guilty about not sharing. The key here is mutual respect and boundaries. If the friend is constantly asking or expecting to share the author's food without contributing, the author has the right to say no. So the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because they're maintaining their own autonomy and not obligated to share when they're covering all the costs.\n"
