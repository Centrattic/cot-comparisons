He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves two friends living together. The author is the one paying for everything, including groceries, while the friend doesn't contribute financially. The issue is that the friend keeps taking portions of the author's meal, even though there's supposed to be enough food for both. The author sometimes gives in to the friend's silent pressure.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend isn't paying bills or groceries, which is a big deal. The author is covering all the costs. Then, the friend is taking food without asking, using passive-aggressive tactics like staring until the author gives in. The author is trying to maintain the friendship despite the friend's other issues (loud, dirty, smelly). The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing their meal.\n\nSo, from the friend's perspective, maybe they feel entitled to food since they live there. But the author is clearly the one paying for everything. The friend's behavior of taking without asking and the pressure tactics are problematic. The author is setting boundaries by sometimes not giving in, which makes sense because they're the one providing. However, the author might feel guilty because they don't want to hurt the friendship. \n\nBut in terms of right and wrong: sharing food is a personal choice. The friend isn't contributing, so expecting the author to share might not be fair. The author is within their rights to keep their own food. The friend's actions (taking without asking) are more on them. The author isn't in the wrong for defending their own meal, especially when they're covering all the costs. The real issue here is the friend's lack of contribution and the pressure to share. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could communicate better. But the question is about being in the wrong. The author isn't violating any rules; they're just protecting what they've paid for. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
