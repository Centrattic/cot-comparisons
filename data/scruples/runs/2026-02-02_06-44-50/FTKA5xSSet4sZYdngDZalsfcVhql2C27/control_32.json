He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The friend lives with them, doesn't pay bills or groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud or dirty. The friend often wants a portion of the author's meal, and the author usually gives in but sometimes doesn't. The friend stares until the author complies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author is providing for the friend's basic needs by ensuring there's enough food, even if not the same type. The friend isn't paying for anything, which might be a point. But the key issue is the expectation of sharing food. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in might be seen as manipulative or pressuring. \n\nIs it fair for the friend to expect food sharing if they aren't contributing? The author might feel it's unfair because they're already covering all costs. On the other hand, maybe the friend feels they should be included in meals, especially if they're living together. But the author is setting boundaries by not always sharing. \n\nThe picture provided (though I can't see it) might show the context of the meals. Maybe the author is eating something the friend doesn't have access to, but the author ensures there's enough food overall. \n\nIn many relationships, especially living arrangements, boundaries are important. The friend's lack of contribution might justify the author not sharing, especially if the friend isn't respecting the author's personal space or belongings. The friend's behavior of staring to pressure sharing could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing. They're setting boundaries and the friend isn't contributing to the household. The answer should be B.\n"
