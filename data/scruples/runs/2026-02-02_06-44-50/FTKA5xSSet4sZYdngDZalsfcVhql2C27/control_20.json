He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not sharing food with their best friend who lives with them. The friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries and uses the author's car. The author feels they're not at fault because they already provide enough food, but the friend keeps asking for portions of their meals.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the living arrangement, financial contributions, and the specific issue of food sharing. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might affect the dynamic. The author is making sure there's enough food, but the friend is taking portions from their meals, which the author is getting tired of.\n\nThe author is saying they put up with other issues like noise and mess because of friendship, but now they're being asked to share their food every time. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in suggests pressure without direct communication. The author's stance is that they're not obligated to share their specific meals, especially if they've already ensured there's enough food available.\n\nSo, considering that the friend isn't contributing financially, the author's responsibility isn't clear-cut. The friend's actions might be seen as taking advantage. The author isn't in the wrong for not sharing their personal food portions, especially since they already provide for the friend. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
