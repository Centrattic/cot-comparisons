He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that they live with their best friend who doesn't pay bills or groceries, and the friend keeps asking for food portions. The writer says they make sure there's enough food for both, but the friend just stares until they give in. The question is if the author is wrong for not sharing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, so the writer is covering all expenses. That's a significant point. Even though they're friends, it's not fair for one person to bear all the costs. The friend expecting to get food without contributing might be exploiting the situation.\n\nThen, the act of not sharing food. The writer mentions making sure there's enough food, but maybe not the same type. If there's already food available, but the friend is asking for a specific meal, the writer isn't obligated to share. The friend's behavior of staring until they get what they want is manipulative. The writer isn't wrong for not giving in every time. It's their right to control their own food, especially since they're the one paying for it.\n\nAlso, considering the friend's other habits like being loud or dirty, the writer is already tolerating a lot. It's reasonable for them to set boundaries around their food. The friend's expectation of automatic sharing without contribution is unfair. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
