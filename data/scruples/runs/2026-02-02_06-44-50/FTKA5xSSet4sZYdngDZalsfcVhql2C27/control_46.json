He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. They live together, and the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, which is a red flag already. The friend is getting rides from them too. So the author is covering all expenses, and now the friend wants portions from their meals. The friend doesn't have their own food, but the author says they make sure there's enough for both, even if it's different types. The friend just stares until the author gives in.\n\nHmm, the key points here are responsibility and boundaries. The author is taking care of all the expenses, so maybe it's unfair to expect them to share every meal. The friend isn't contributing financially, so maybe it's reasonable for the author to set boundaries. Also, the friend's behavior of staring until they get food could be seen as manipulative. The author isn't in the wrong if they decide not to share, especially since they're already shouldering all the costs. The answer is probably B, not in the wrong.\n"
