He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author and their best friend living together. The friend doesn't pay any bills, groceries, or has a car, and the author covers all these expenses. The main issue is that the friend wants a portion of the author's meal each time they eat, and the author sometimes gives in under pressure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend is living for free without contributing, which already sets up an imbalance. The author is handling all financial responsibilities. Now, regarding the food sharing: the author says they ensure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. The friend is pressuring them to share by staring until they comply.\n\nThe author is not in the wrong because they've set boundaries. They're making sure there's enough food for both, which means the friend isn't left without. The pressure from the friend isn't fair; the author isn't obligated to share every meal, especially since the friend isn't contributing. The friend's behavior of staring and expecting food without contributing is the issue here. The author is maintaining their right to choose what they eat, even if it's a different type of food. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
