He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about a best friend who lives with the author, doesn't pay any bills or groceries, and often asks for food during meals. The author sometimes gives in, but now they're questioning if they're wrong for not sharing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend isn't contributing financially, which is a big factor. Living with someone and not paying their share can create an imbalance. Then there's the issue of food sharing. The author makes sure there's enough food for both, but it's not always the same type. The friend just stares until the author gives in, which might be a form of passive pressure.\n\nSo, the author is trying to set a boundary by not sharing their meal. The question is if that's justified. On one hand, the friend is relying on the author's generosity without contributing. On the other hand, the author is trying to protect their own resources. The friend's behavior of staring and not just asking directly might be manipulative. \n\nAlso, the author mentions putting up with other issues like loudness and being dirty, but that's separate. The main issue here is food sharing. The author isn't obligated to share their meal if they don't want to, especially since the friend isn't contributing. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to their own food without being pressured.\n"
