He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The key points here are the living arrangement and the responsibilities each person has.\n\nFirst, the friend lives with them but doesn't pay any bills or contribute to groceries. The author covers all the expenses, including groceries. The friend also uses the author's car. So, the author is essentially supporting the friend financially. \n\nNow, the main issue is the friend taking portions of the author's meals. The author mentions that they make sure there's enough food for both, even if it's not the same type. The friend doesn't say anything directly but uses passive-aggressive staring to get the author to share. The author usually gives in, but now they're questioning if they're wrong for not sharing.\n\nFrom my perspective, the author isn't in the wrong. They've been accommodating the friend despite the friend's shortcomings in contributing to household expenses. The friend's behavior of taking food without contributing financially is unfair. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially since they're the one covering all costs. The friend's actions, like staring, are manipulative and shouldn't dictate the author's behavior. The author's decision to not share is a reasonable boundary given the circumstances. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
