He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, and the friend often wants a portion of their meal without being asked directly. The poster usually gives in but is now questioning if they're wrong for not sharing sometimes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend doesn't contribute financially, which is a big point. Sharing food is part of everyday life, but the poster is responsible for buying groceries. If they're making sure there's enough food for both, but the friend is taking without asking, that could be an issue of respect. The friend's behavior of staring until the poster gives in seems manipulative. \n\nThe poster is the one providing the food, so they have the right to decide how to consume their own meal. The friend should either ask politely or make their own food. The fact that the friend is loud, dirty, and smelly adds to the idea that they're not respecting boundaries. The poster is tolerating a lot already, so not sharing when they choose isn't wrong. Also, the friend isn't in a situation of needing food; the poster ensures there's enough available, so it's not a matter of survival. \n\nOn the flip side, if the friend is taking from the shared groceries, maybe they have a right to use the food they're supposed to have access to. But since they're not contributing, maybe the poster isn't obligated to share every meal. It's a bit of a gray area, but considering the friend's lack of contribution and the manipulative behavior, the poster isn't in the wrong.\n"
