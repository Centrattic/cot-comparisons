He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about not sharing food with their best friend who lives with them. The friend doesn't pay for anything, including groceries, and just takes a portion of the author's meals sometimes without being asked.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author and their friend live together, but the friend isn't contributing financially. That's already a red flag. The author mentions they make sure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. The friend just stares until the author gives in. \n\nSharing food can be a personal boundary. Even if there's food available, the act of taking someone else's meal without permission can be seen as crossing a line. The friend isn't paying for the groceries, so maybe the author should set clearer boundaries. But the author is letting the friend stay for free, which might imply some level of generosity, but that doesn't mean the friend can take without asking. \n\nThe author is conflicted because they value the friendship but are being asked to share their personal food. The friend's behavior of staring to get the author to comply could be manipulative. The author is the one cooking, so they have the right to decide how their food is used. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have set boundaries earlier. If the friend expects to share meals, maybe they should have discussed it upfront. But the friend is taking without asking, which is problematic. The author is justified in not wanting to share if they prepared the meal specifically for themselves. \n\nSo considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're standing up for their own food when the friend isn't contributing. The friend's actions are inappropriate. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
