He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, and the friend often wants a portion of the author's meal. The author sometimes gives in, but sometimes doesn't. The friend just stares until the author gives in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend isn't contributing financially, which is a big part of rooming agreements. Typically, when two people live together, it's expected that they split costs. If the friend isn't paying for anything, that's already a problem. The author is taking care of groceries and transportation, which are significant responsibilities. \n\nNow, the food sharing part. The author makes sure there's enough food, but not necessarily the same type. The friend is asking for a portion, but the author might be making specific meals for themselves. If the friend is used to getting a portion, but the author isn't obligated to share, especially if the meals aren't meant for sharing. The staring until the author gives in could be seen as manipulation. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing. If the friend isn't contributing to the household expenses, it's reasonable for the author to set boundaries. The author might be overstepping if the friend is genuinely in need, but since they're described as a friend who sometimes is loud or dirty, maybe the author is tired of accommodating all their behaviors. \n\nOn the other hand, if the friend is used to getting food from the author, the author might need to communicate their boundaries. The problem is the friend's entitlement to the author's food without contributing. The author isn't wrong for not sharing if they're not responsible for feeding the friend beyond what's already provided. \n\nSo, considering the friend isn't paying for anything, the author is in the right to not share their specific meals. The answer is B.\n"
