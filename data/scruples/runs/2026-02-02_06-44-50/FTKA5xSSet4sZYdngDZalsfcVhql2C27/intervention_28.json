He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author lives with their best friend, who doesn't pay any bills or contribute to groceries. The friend also doesn't have a car, so the author provides transportation. Despite the friend's loudness, messiness, and bad smell, the author tolerates it because they're friends. Now, the main issue is that whenever the author eats, the friend wants a portion of their meal. The author says they ensure there's enough food for both, though not necessarily the same type. The friend doesn't outright ask but uses a stare, and the author usually gives in.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The friend isn't contributing financially, so the author is covering all the living costs. That's a significant burden. Then, the friend expects food from the author's meals without contributing. Even if there's food available, the author is making their own meal, and the friend is taking a portion. The author is being pressured into sharing through passive-aggressive behavior (staring), not direct communication. \n\nThe key points here are: \n1. The friend isn't contributing to the household expenses, including groceries.\n2. The author is making their own meals, which the friend then takes a part of without asking directly.\n3. The author is being manipulated into sharing, which they might not be comfortable with.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if the friend isn't paying for groceries, they shouldn't expect the author to provide food for them. The author is already allowing them to stay for free, which is generous. Expecting the author to share their personal meals on top of that could be seen as taking advantage. The friend's behavior of staring to get what they want is manipulative and not respectful of the author's autonomy.\n\nHowever, some might argue that since there's food in the house, the friend is just using what's available. But the author mentions that they make sure there's enough for both, which could imply that the friend is supposed to take from the shared supplies, not the author's personal meal. If the author is making a specific meal for themselves, the friend shouldn't expect to take part of it without contributing to it. \n\nThe author's tolerance for the friend's other issues (noise, mess) might lead them to feel obligated to also share their food, but that doesn't mean they're in the wrong. It's about setting boundaries. The friend's behavior is more about taking without asking, which could be considered rude or inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for not wanting to share their meal. The friend is the one in the wrong for expecting it without contributing and using passive pressure. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
