He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The friend doesn't pay bills, groceries, or has a car, so the author covers all that. The friend takes a portion of their meal every time, and the author usually gives in but is now questioning it.\n\nFirst, the living arrangement: the friend isn't contributing financially at all. That's a big factor. They're living for free, including groceries. So the author is covering all the costs. Now, the friend is taking food without contributing, which could be seen as taking advantage. The author is setting boundaries now, which is reasonable because they're paying for everything.\n\nThe friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in suggests they expect sharing regardless of contribution. The author might feel taken advantage of, especially since they're already shouldering all the expenses. Sharing food is one thing, but when it's part of the author's own meal and the other person isn't contributing, it's a boundary issue. The author is asserting their right to their own food, which they've paid for, so they're not in the wrong. Answer B makes sense here.\n"
