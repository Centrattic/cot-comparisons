He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that the friend lives with them, doesn't pay any bills or groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud, dirty, or smelly. The main issue is that the friend takes a portion of the author's meals regularly, and the author usually gives in despite not wanting to.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend isn't contributing financially. The author is covering all expenses, which might create an imbalance. If the friend is taking food without offering to contribute, it's a problem. The author is making sure there's enough food for both, but maybe the friend isn't helping with the cost. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in seems manipulative or entitled.\n\nOn the other hand, the author mentions they're best friends, so there's a personal relationship. Maybe they expect mutual support. However, the friend isn't pulling their weight in terms of expenses. The author might feel that their own food is being taken without any reciprocation beyond just living there for free. \n\nThe key points here are the financial responsibility and the power dynamic. If the author is shouldering all costs and the friend isn't contributing, the friend's expectation to take food without offering to help pay could be unfair. The author's decision not to share might be a reasonable boundary given the lack of contribution. So, the author isn't in the wrong because they're setting boundaries in an unequal living situation. The answer would be B (No).\n"
