He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The friend lives with them, doesn't pay bills or groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud, dirty, and smelly. The friend takes portions of the author's meals, but the author makes sure there's enough food for both, even if not the same type. The author sometimes gives in to the friend's silent pressure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The friend isn't contributing financially, which is a significant point. The author is covering all expenses, so maybe the friend's expectation to share food is unfair. Also, the friend is taking without asking, using passive-aggressive tactics like staring. The author is trying to set boundaries by making sure there's enough food, but the friend still expects to take from the author's meals.\n\nBut the author does say they make sure there's enough food for both, just not the same type. So maybe they are providing alternatives. However, the friend is taking from the author's specific meal, which the author might have prepared for themselves. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in suggests manipulation, which is not okay.\n\nThe author's main issue is that they're being asked to share their personal meal portions, which they might not be comfortable with. Since the friend isn't contributing, it's reasonable for the author to set boundaries. They are allowing the friend to eat, but the friend is taking more than just sharing. So the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing their specific meals, especially if they've already provided food that the friend can eat. The friend's actions are disrespectful and take advantage of the author's generosity.\n"
