He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. Let's break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author lives with their best friend. The friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries and lives there for free. The author takes care of all the expenses and transportation. The friend is sometimes loud, dirty, and smelly, but the author puts up with it because they're friends. Now, the main issue is that whenever the author eats, the friend wants a portion of their meal. The friend doesn't have their own food, but the author says they always make sure there's enough for both, just not the same type. The friend stares until the author gives in.\n\nFirst, the friend isn't contributing financially. If the author is covering all the costs, including groceries, then the friend is relying on the author's resources. But the author mentions they ensure there's enough food for both, so maybe there's an expectation of sharing. However, the problem is the friend taking a portion of the author's specific meal. If the author is making separate meals, maybe the friend is not respecting the author's choice to eat something different. The friend's method of staring until the author complies might be manipulative or pressure.\n\nThe author is in a position where they're providing everything, but the friend is taking without contributing. The author has the right to not share their specific meal if they've already provided for the friend's general food needs. The friend's behavior is inconsiderate and possibly entitled. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries here. They've already ensured the friend has food, so the friend's insistence on taking from the author's meal is unreasonable. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
