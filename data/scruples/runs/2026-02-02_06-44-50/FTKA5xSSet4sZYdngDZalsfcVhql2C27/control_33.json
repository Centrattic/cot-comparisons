He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is that they live with their best friend who doesn't pay any bills or groceries, and the friend keeps wanting a portion of their meals. The writer says they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend just stares until the writer gives in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend isn't contributing financially, which already sets up a potential imbalance. The writer is covering all the costs, including transportation. Now, the friend is asking for food portions. The writer is giving in most of the time, but maybe they feel it's unfair.\n\nThe key points are: the friend isn't paying anything, the writer is providing food, but the friend is taking portions without asking. The writer feels pressured to give in. The picture might show the friend taking food without permission, like in the image where someone is taking a plate of food without being offered.\n\nBut the writer also mentions they're putting up with other issues like noise and smell because it's their best friend. So maybe they feel obligated to share food even when it's not ideal. The friend's behavior of staring until they get what they want could be seen as manipulative or demanding.\n\nIs it the writer's fault for not sharing? Well, they do mention they ensure there's enough food for both, but not the same type. So if the friend is getting their own food but still wants the specific meal the writer is having, it's understandable the writer might say no. The friend not paying for anything adds to the tension. Maybe the writer isn't in the wrong here because they're already covering everything else, and the friend's demands are excessive.\n\nBut another angle is that the writer is making food for both, so sharing is expected. However, the friend isn't contributing, so maybe the writer isn't obligated. The act of sharing should be mutual, but since the friend isn't contributing financially, the writer might feel it's unfair to keep giving food portions without any reciprocation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the writer isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're managing their own resources and setting boundaries, even if they sometimes give in. The friend's behavior is more problematic because of the lack of contribution and the pressure to take food. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
