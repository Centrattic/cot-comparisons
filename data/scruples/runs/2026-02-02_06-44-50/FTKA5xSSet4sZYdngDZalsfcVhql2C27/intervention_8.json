He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that the friend lives with them for free, doesn't pay bills or groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud, dirty, and smelly. The main issue is that whenever the author eats, the friend wants a portion, and they usually give in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might create an imbalance. The author mentions they make sure there's enough food, but not always the same type. The friend doesn't ask directly, just stares until the author gives in. \n\nSo, is the author wrong for not sharing? Well, if the friend is living there without contributing, the author might feel they have the right to their own food. However, the friend might see living together as a shared responsibility, so expecting to share meals. But the friend isn't paying their share, so the author could feel it's unfair to share their own meals. \n\nThe friend's approach of staring instead of asking clearly is problematic. That's passive-aggressive and disrespectful. The author should set boundaries, but the question is about whether they're wrong for not sharing. If the author is not obligated to share because the friend isn't contributing, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the friendship includes mutual support, maybe they should share. However, the friend's lack of contribution might justify the author not sharing. So the answer could be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
