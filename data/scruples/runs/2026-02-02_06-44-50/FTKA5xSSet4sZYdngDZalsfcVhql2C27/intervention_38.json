He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style question is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The scenario is that the friend lives with them, doesn't pay any bills or groceries, uses their car, and sometimes is loud or dirty. The main issue is that the friend expects a portion of the author's meal every time they eat, and the author is conflicted about giving in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their living situation. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might already be a point of contention. The author takes care of groceries and transportation, so there's an imbalance in responsibilities. Now, the friend is taking food portions without being asked, which the author feels is a bit much.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. If the friend is taking food without being asked, that's one thing. But if the author is giving in under pressure (like the friend staring until they give in), that might indicate the friend is being pushy. However, the author does mention that there's usually enough food for both, even if not the same type. So maybe the friend isn't in a dire situation where they absolutely need the food.\n\nThe author might feel they're being taken advantage of, especially since they're already shouldering all the costs. On the other hand, the friend might feel that as a housemate, sharing meals is part of the arrangement. But if the friend isn't contributing financially, expecting food might be crossing a line. The author might not be obligated to share their personal meals if the friend isn't paying their share. However, the friend might see it as a social norm in a shared living space. \n\nAlso, the fact that the friend uses the author's car and doesn't pay rent might mean they're relying too much on the author's resources. The author's boundaries are important here. If the friend is pressuring them to share food without contributing, the author is justified in setting limits. But if the author is giving in out of guilt or friendship, they might feel conflicted. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about mutual respect and contribution. If the friend isn't contributing, expecting food might be unfair. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially if the friend is exploiting the arrangement. However, the author could also consider discussing the situation openly to find a middle ground. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because the friend isn't contributing financially and the author has the right to their own meals without being pressured. The friend might need to take responsibility for their share or adjust their expectations.\n"
