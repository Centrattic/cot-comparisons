He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend who lives with them. The friend doesn't pay any bills, groceries, or have a car, so the author covers everything. Now, the friend often wants a portion of the author's meals, and the author sometimes gives in but not always.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. They're roommates and friends, so there's an expectation of mutual respect and fairness. The author is providing housing and meals, but the friend isn't contributing financially. That's a key point. If the friend isn't paying for groceries, maybe they should be contributing in another way, but they're not. The author is making sure there's enough food, just not the same type. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in could be seen as manipulative.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is the one who made the food. They have the right to decide how they want to eat. The friend's request for a portion might be reasonable if it's occasional, but if it's constant and the author feels pressured, that's different. The author is setting boundaries by not always giving in. The friend's actions (lounging, not paying, being messy) could affect the living environment. The author might be trying to maintain personal space and autonomy regarding food.\n\nBut since they're best friends, maybe the author feels obligated. However, they're also roommates, so setting boundaries is important. The friend's lack of contribution and the behavior of pressuring for food might make the author's stance valid. The author isn't in the wrong if they're maintaining their own needs and respecting their right to eat what they prepare. The friend's expectations might be unreasonable given their lack of financial contribution and the pressure tactics used.\n"
