He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend who lives with them but doesn't pay any bills. The friend doesn't pay for groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud or dirty. The main issue is that the friend wants a portion of the author's meal every time they eat, and the author sometimes gives in but not always.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend doesn't pay rent or bills, which might imply an informal agreement where the author is providing housing and meals in exchange for friendship or other considerations. But that's not necessarily a set rule. The user is providing a lot of support, so maybe the friend is relying on them a bit too much.\n\nThe food sharing part is key. The author says they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend is nonverbal in their request, just staring, which could be seen as passive-aggressive. The author sometimes gives in, which might be out of guilt or feeling responsible, but not always. The question is whether the author is wrong for not always sharing.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the friend isn't contributing to the household expenses, it's reasonable for the author to set boundaries. The author isn't obligated to share their food, especially if it's their own meal. The friend's behavior of staring could be seen as manipulative. The author might be in the right to say no sometimes, especially if it's their personal meal. However, the fact that the author usually gives in might suggest they feel some responsibility, but that doesn't mean they have to do it every time. \n\nAlso, the friend's overall behavior (being loud, dirty) is problematic, but the author tolerates it. So the friend isn't a model roommate. If the author is providing a home and some food, but the friend isn't contributing, the author has a right to set limits on food sharing. The main issue is whether the friend's request is reasonable. Since the author ensures there's enough food, maybe the friend isn't in a position to demand a portion each time. The author isn't in the wrong for not sharing when it's their own meal, especially if the friend isn't contributing to the household. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
