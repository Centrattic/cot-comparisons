He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, and uses the author's car. The friend often wants a portion of the author's meal, staring until the author gives in. The author made sure there's enough food, but maybe not the same type.\n\nSo, first, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might be a point. The author is providing housing, transportation, and groceries. The friend is taking food without contributing. But the author mentions they make sure there's enough food for both, just not the same type. That might mean they're getting different meals, but the friend expects to share.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not sharing. The friend's behavior of staring until given food could be seen as pressuring the author. If the author is making their own meal, maybe they have the right to decide how to eat it. But since they live together and the friend isn't paying, there's a mutual agreement or expectation of sharing resources. However, the author might be setting boundaries by not sharing their specific meal.\n\nOn one hand, the friend is taking advantage of the situation by not paying and expecting food. On the other, the author might be overstepping by not sharing, especially if they have the means to provide. But the author says they make sure there's food for both, so maybe they're fulfilling their part. The key point is whether the friend has a right to the author's specific meal. If the author is cooking for themselves, the friend might not have a right to it unless there's an agreement to share. The pressure from the friend to share could be the issue here. The author might be justified in not giving in if they're not obligated to share every meal. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if they're maintaining their boundaries after ensuring the friend has food.\n"
