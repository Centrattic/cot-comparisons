He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, and the friend often asks for a portion of the author's meal. The author sometimes gives in but not always. The friend doesn't have a car, so the author takes them places. The friend is loud, messy, and smelly, but the author puts up with it because they're friends.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness and mutual responsibility. The friend isn't contributing financially, so maybe the author expects some consideration in return. But when it comes to food, the author mentions that they make sure there's enough for both, but maybe not the same type. The friend is non-confrontational, just staring until the author gives in. So the author is conflicted about whether they're wrong for not sharing.\n\nI need to consider the balance of responsibility. If the friend isn't paying for groceries, then maybe the author shouldn't have to share their meals. But since they're best friends, maybe there's an unspoken expectation of sharing. However, the author is the one providing all the financial support, so it's reasonable for them to set boundaries. The friend's behavior of staring until they get what they want could be manipulative. The author is trying to assert their right to keep their own food, which is a valid boundary. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. They're maintaining their own needs despite the friend's free-riding in other areas. But some might argue that as best friends, sharing meals is part of the friendship, especially since the author is providing the living situation. But since the friend isn't contributing, maybe the author isn't obligated. I think the answer hinges on whether the author has the right to set personal boundaries despite the friendship. So the author might not be in the wrong if they're establishing limits on their own food consumption, especially when the friend isn't contributing financially. The friend's behavior of not paying bills and then expecting food shares might be the real issue. So the author's stance is reasonable.\n"
