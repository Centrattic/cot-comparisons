He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud or dirty. The friend wants a portion of the author's meal every time they eat, often just staring until the author gives in. The author provides a picture (though I can't see it), but the main points are there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness in the living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing to expenses, which is a big point. The author is covering all the costs, which might lead to resentment. The friend expecting food without contributing financially could be problematic. However, friendships are based on mutual respect and understanding. The author is making an effort to ensure there's enough food, but the friend is demanding a portion each time, which could be seen as taking advantage.\n\nThe friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in might be a form of passive-aggressive pressure. The author is setting boundaries here by not sharing, which is their right. But maybe the friend's expectation is unreasonable given that they aren't contributing. On the other hand, the author might be overstepping if they're not considering the friend's needs, but since the friend has food available, maybe the author isn't obligated to share every meal.\n\nI should also consider cultural norms or social expectations. In some cultures, sharing food is common, but in others, personal space and belongings are respected. The key here is that the author is making an effort to have enough food, but the friend's behavior is manipulative. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting their boundaries, especially when the friend isn't contributing to shared expenses. So the answer is B (No).\n"
