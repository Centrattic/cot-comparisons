He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend who lives with them. The friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud, dirty, or smelly. The friend often wants a portion of the author's meal, and the author sometimes gives in under pressure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend lives there for free and doesn't contribute to expenses. That's a red flag because typically, roommates share costs. The author is covering all the bills and groceries, which might be unfair. But the question is about the food sharing specifically.\n\nThe author mentions they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. So maybe they have different meals, but the friend still expects a portion. The friend uses a tactic of staring until the author gives in. That's a form of passive-aggressive pressure, which isn't respectful.\n\nThe author is trying to set boundaries by sometimes not sharing. The friend's behavior seems to be taking advantage. The author's responsibility here is to their own needs. If they're making their own meal, they have the right to eat it without being forced to share. The friend's lack of contribution to household expenses adds to the imbalance.\n\nBut since they're friends, maybe there's an expectation of generosity. However, the friend's actions (not paying, making demands) might be crossing a line. The author is asserting their right to keep their food, which is reasonable. The friend's behavior is more problematic because they're not contributing and using pressure tactics. So the author isn't in the wrong here; they're setting necessary boundaries.\n"
