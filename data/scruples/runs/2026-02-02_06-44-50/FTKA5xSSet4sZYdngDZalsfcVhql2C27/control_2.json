He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that they live with their best friend, who doesn't pay bills or groceries and uses their car. The friend often wants a portion of their food, and the poster sometimes gives in under pressure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend isn't contributing financially, so the poster is covering all expenses. That's a big factor. Then there's the issue of the friend taking food without being asked. The poster mentions making sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. So maybe the friend isn't getting the exact meal, but wants a part of the one the poster is eating.\n\nThe key points are consent and boundaries. The friend is using a stare to pressure the poster into sharing, which is a form of passive-aggressive behavior. The poster isn't comfortable with this dynamic. The poster should have the right to choose whether to share their food without being coerced. Since the friend is not contributing to the household, it's reasonable for the poster to set boundaries. The photo provided might show the situation where the friend is staring, reinforcing that non-verbal pressure.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the poster is already shouldering all financial responsibilities. The friend's behavior might be seen as exploiting the arrangement. The poster isn't in the wrong for asserting their right to their own food without being forced to share. It's about mutual respect in the living situation. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
