He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend lives with the author but doesn't pay any bills or contribute to groceries. The author is the one covering all the expenses. The friend also uses the author's car for transportation. So, the author is taking on a lot of financial responsibility here. \n\nNow, the main issue is the friend expecting to get a portion of the author's meals every time they eat. The author mentions that they ensure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend doesn't outright ask but uses a stare to pressure the author into sharing. The author usually gives in but now is questioning whether they should stop.\n\nHmm, the key points here are mutual respect and fairness. The friend isn't contributing financially, yet expects food. Even if there's enough, if it's not the same type, maybe the author is making different meals each time. If the friend is used to getting a share without contributing, that's a problem. The author's boundaries are valid because they're not obligated to share their meals when they're the one paying for everything. \n\nBut friends often expect kindness and support. However, setting boundaries isn't wrong. The friend's behavior of pressuring without contributing might be the real issue here. The author is standing up for themselves, which is reasonable. They're not in the wrong for maintaining their own meals when the friend isn't helping. So, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
