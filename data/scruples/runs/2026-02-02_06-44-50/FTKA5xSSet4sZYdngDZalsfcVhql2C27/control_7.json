He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud or dirty. The main issue is that the friend takes a portion of the author's meal without being asked, and the author usually gives in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. Since the friend doesn't contribute financially, it's a one-sided arrangement. The author covers all the costs, which might create an imbalance. The friend's behavior of taking food without consent is problematic. Even if there's food available, the act of taking someone else's meal without permission is a boundary issue. The author might feel that their personal choice to eat their own meal is being infringed. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might feel entitled because they're sharing a home, but the author isn't obligated to share their meals. The fact that the friend uses passive-aggressive tactics like staring until the author gives in suggests manipulation. The author's tolerance for other issues (loudness, messiness) doesn't mean they must also tolerate having their food taken. \n\nFinancial responsibility is a big factor here. The author is bearing all costs, so expecting them to share their meals might be unfair. The friend isn't contributing, so the author isn't wrong to prioritize their own needs. Also, respecting personal space and belongings (including food) is important in any living situation. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing their food when it's their own meal. The friend should have their own meals prepared if they don't want to contribute financially. The author's refusal here is about setting boundaries, which is necessary for a healthy dynamic.\n"
