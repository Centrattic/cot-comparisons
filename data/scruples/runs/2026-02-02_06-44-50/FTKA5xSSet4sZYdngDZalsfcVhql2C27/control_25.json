He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries and lives there for free. The author takes them everywhere since they don't have a car. The friend is sometimes loud, dirty, and smelly, but the author puts up with it because they're friends. Now, the issue is that whenever the author eats, the friend wants a portion, even though there's enough food for both. The friend doesn't ask directly but stares until the author gives in or not. The author usually does give in.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for not sharing. Let's consider the dynamics here. The friend isn't contributing financially, so the author is covering all expenses. The friend's expectation of getting a portion each time might be seen as taking advantage. The author is making sure there's food for both, but not necessarily the same type. The friend's passive pressure through staring is manipulative.\n\nThe author's actions seem justified because they're already shouldering all the costs and responsibilities. The friend's behavior is more about entitlement without contributing. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries here. They have the right to decide how to use their own food, especially when they're the one covering the bills and groceries. The friend needs to be more respectful and maybe take responsibility for their own meals sometimes.\n"
