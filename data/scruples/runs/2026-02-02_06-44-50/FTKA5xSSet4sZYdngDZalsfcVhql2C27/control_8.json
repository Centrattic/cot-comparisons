He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud, dirty, and smelly. The friend keeps trying to get a portion of the author's meal, and the author usually gives in but is now questioning if they should stop.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the living arrangement and the financial responsibilities. The friend is living for free, not contributing to bills or groceries, which is a big part of the dynamic. The author is covering all the expenses, which is a significant financial burden. The friend's behavior of asking for food portions isn't just about sharing; it's more about the friend not contributing and expecting the author to accommodate them.\n\nThen there's the issue of the friend's conduct\u2014being loud, dirty, and smelly. The author is already putting up with these things because of their friendship. Now, adding the food sharing expectation without contributing financially seems unfair. The author's main question is whether they're wrong for not sharing. The friend doesn't have their own food, but the author ensures there's enough, even if not the same type. However, the friend's non-verbal pressure (staring) to get food is a passive-aggressive tactic, which can be manipulative.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author is entitled to set boundaries. Since the friend isn't contributing to the household expenses, the author shouldn't be obligated to share their meals. The fact that the author usually gives in might be out of habit or guilt, but it's reasonable to reassess that if it's causing stress. The friend's behavior is taking advantage of the author's kindness. So, the author isn't in the wrong for deciding not to share; they have the right to prioritize their own needs and establish limits, especially when the friend isn't contributing to the living costs.\n"
