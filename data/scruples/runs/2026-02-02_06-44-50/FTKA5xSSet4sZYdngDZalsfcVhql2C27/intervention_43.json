He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The scenario involves two people living together. The friend doesn't pay bills, groceries, or have a car, relying on the author for transportation. The main issue is that the friend takes portions of the author's meals, and the author is conflicted about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might create an imbalance. The author is covering all expenses, including groceries, but the friend is taking food from the author's meals. The author mentions they make sure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. The friend uses passive-aggressive behavior, staring until the author gives in most times.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing. The author is in a situation where they are providing for the friend's basic needs without reciprocation. The friend's actions of taking food without consent could be seen as disrespectful, especially since the author is already covering groceries. The author's refusal to share might be a boundary, which is their right. However, the friend is taking advantage of the arrangement by not contributing and expecting food.\n\nOn the other hand, sharing meals could be a social norm, even if the author is covering the costs. The friend's behavior might stem from a lack of awareness rather than malice. But since the author clearly states they make sure there's enough food, the friend's actions could be seen as unnecessary. The key point is whether the author has the right to set boundaries. Since they are the one providing and the friend isn't contributing, the author might be justified in not sharing. Therefore, the answer is more likely B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
