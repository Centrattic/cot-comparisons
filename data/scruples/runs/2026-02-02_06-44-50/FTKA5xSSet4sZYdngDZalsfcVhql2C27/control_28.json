He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend who lives with them but doesn't pay any bills or contribute to groceries. The friend is taking portions without being asked, using a passive-aggressive stare to get food.\n\nFirst, the living arrangement: the friend doesn't pay rent or bills, and there's no mention of any agreement about splitting expenses. Since they're roommates, even if they're friends, splitting costs is usually expected. But here, the friend isn't contributing at all. That could be a problem from the start.\n\nNow, the food issue. The author makes sure there's enough food for both, but the friend takes a portion without being asked. The author usually gives in but is now considering not sharing. The key point here is consent. If the friend is taking food without permission, that's an issue. The author isn't obligated to share their personal meal unless there's an agreement. Even if they're friends, respecting boundaries is important.\n\nThe friend's actions\u2014staring until the author gives in\u2014might be seen as manipulation. The author is setting a boundary by not sharing, which they have the right to do. However, maybe there's an expectation in their friendship that the author is supposed to share. But given that the friend isn't contributing, the author's frustration is valid. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they're not sharing their own meal, even if there's food available, they're not at fault. They're asserting their right to their own food. The friend's behavior is problematic for not contributing and taking without asking. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
