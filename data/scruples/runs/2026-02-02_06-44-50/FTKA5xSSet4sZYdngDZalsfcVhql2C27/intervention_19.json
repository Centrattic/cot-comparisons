He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, and the friend often just stares until the author gives them part of their meal.\n\nHmm, so the author says they make sure there's enough food for both, but maybe not the same type. The friend isn't paying anything, which is a big point. If someone lives with you and doesn't contribute financially, is it fair to expect them to share food? The friend is taking portions without being asked, which seems a bit entitled. The author is the one providing the food, so they might not have an obligation to share every meal. The friend's behavior of staring until they get it sounds manipulative. The author is setting boundaries by sometimes not giving in, which could be seen as right because they're protecting their own food. But maybe they should communicate better? However, the question is about being in the wrong. Since the friend isn't contributing, the author isn't obligated to share. So maybe the author is in the right. Answer B.\n"
