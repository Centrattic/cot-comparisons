He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is rooming with their best friend who doesn't pay rent or groceries and uses their car. The friend often wants to share the author's meals, even though there's food available. The author sometimes gives in but feels conflicted.\n\nFirst, the living arrangement isn't equitable. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might create an imbalance. However, they're close friends, so the author might tolerate more than they would with someone else. The key issue is the food sharing. The author says there's enough food for both, but the friend is pressuring them for portions. Since the author provides for groceries, maybe the friend isn't eating the same meals. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in seems manipulative. The author might feel they're being coerced into sharing their meal, which could be a personal boundary. If the author is uncomfortable with the friend's insistence, they have a right to set boundaries. But the friend isn't starving, so the expectation to share might not be justified. The author's tolerance for other issues (noise, cleanliness) might make them less inclined to refuse the food sharing. However, the author isn't obligated to share their specific meal portions, especially if it's causing them discomfort. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not sharing, as they have the right to their own food choices and boundaries.\n"
