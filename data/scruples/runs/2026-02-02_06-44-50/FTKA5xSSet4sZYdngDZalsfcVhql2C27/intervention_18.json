He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is living with their best friend who doesn't pay any bills, groceries, etc. The friend never pays for anything but expects to get a share of their meals. The author sometimes gives in to the friend's silent pressure. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, the friend isn't contributing financially. If the author is covering all the costs, including groceries, then it's reasonable for the author to control how their own food is used. The friend's behavior of staring until they get food without asking directly seems manipulative. The author might feel obligated because they're friends, but they shouldn't have to feed someone who doesn't contribute. Also, the author mentions the friend is loud and dirty, but they still tolerate it. So, expecting to share food might be an additional burden the author isn't responsible for. The author isn't in the wrong for not sharing when they've already ensured there's enough food available. The friend should take their own portion without expecting the author to give up theirs. So the answer is B.\n"
