He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, and the author covers everything. The friend is loud, messy, and smelly, but the author puts up with it because they're best friends. Now, the friend wants portions of the author's meals, even though there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. The author usually gives in but is now questioning if they should stop.\n\nSo, the main points here. The friend isn't contributing financially, which is a big factor. The author is the one handling all the expenses, which means they have the right to decide how their money is spent. The friend is taking food without contributing, which could be seen as taking advantage. Even though there's enough food, the meals might be something the author specifically wants or prepared, and the friend is taking without asking. The fact that the friend stares until the author gives in suggests manipulation.\n\nBut, the author mentions they usually give in, so maybe the friend has gotten used to that. The author is now standing their ground, which is reasonable. Since the friend isn't paying for groceries, it's the author's food, so they can choose to share or not. The friend's behavior of not asking directly and using a stare could be seen as passive-aggressive. The author isn't obligated to share their own food if they don't want to, especially since the friend is already not contributing. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries here. The answer should be B.\n"
