He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend who lives with them. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the roommate situation: the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, and the author covers everything. The friend uses the author's car, so they're taking a lot of the responsibility. Now, the main issue is the friend wanting portions of the author's meals every time they eat. The author says they make sure there's enough food, but sometimes it's not the same type. The friend uses a stare to get the food, and the author usually gives in.\n\nSo, the key points here are about fairness and boundaries. The author is providing food, but it's not always the same as what they're eating. The friend isn't contributing to the cost of the food, yet expects to get a portion. The author is in a position where they're paying for both, but the friend is taking without giving back. \n\nOn one hand, sharing food can be a kind gesture, especially between friends. But if the friend isn't contributing to the costs and is doing this every time, it might be an imbalance. The author might be overextending by always giving in, even if it's not their explicit responsibility. The friend's behavior of staring to get the food could be seen as manipulative, which might add to the problem.\n\nBut the author does mention that there's enough food, so maybe they are ensuring that the friend has food available. However, the issue is that the friend wants the same meal the author is eating, not just any food. The author might be in the right by setting boundaries, especially since the friend isn't contributing financially. \n\nAlternatively, the author could argue that it's a small act of kindness, but if it's happening every time and the friend isn't helping out, it's a form of exploitation. The friend's lack of contribution in other areas (bills, groceries, cleanliness) might justify the author not sharing every meal. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong if they decide to stop sharing, especially since the friend is not contributing. But the author might need to address the friend's behavior in other areas as well. However, the question is specifically about the food sharing. If the author is making sure there's food available, even if it's not the same type, then not sharing might be their right. The friend should be eating from the available food instead of taking the author's meal. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not sharing.\n"
