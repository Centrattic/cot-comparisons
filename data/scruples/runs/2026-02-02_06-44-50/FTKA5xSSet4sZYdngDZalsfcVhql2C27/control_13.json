He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. \n\nFirst, the situation: They live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, uses their car, and sometimes is loud, dirty, and smelly. The main issue is that the friend wants a portion of the author's meal every time they eat. The author says they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend just stares until the author gives in.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong if they're already providing enough food for both. The friend isn't contributing financially but expects to eat the same meals. The author is setting boundaries by not sharing, which is reasonable. The friend's behavior of staring to pressure sharing isn't fair, especially since they don't cover costs. The key points are the friend's lack of contribution versus the author's efforts to provide. The author isn't obligated to share their specific meals beyond what's already there. So, answer B.\n"
