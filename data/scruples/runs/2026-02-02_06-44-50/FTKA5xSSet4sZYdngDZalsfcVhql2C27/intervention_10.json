He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend they live with. Let me try to break this down. The roommate doesn't pay any bills or groceries, lives there for free, and the author takes them everywhere. The friend wants a portion of their meals every time they eat, and the author usually gives in but sometimes doesn't. The friend doesn't outright ask, just stares until the author complies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The roommate isn't contributing financially, so the author is covering all the costs. Even though there's enough food, the friend wants the same type as the author. Sharing food might be a social norm in some relationships, but that doesn't mean it's mandatory. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in could be seen as passive-aggressive or manipulative. \n\nThe author might feel that they're being taken advantage of because they're the one paying for everything. On the other hand, the friend might see it as a friendly gesture or part of living together. But the key here is that the roommate isn't contributing. If the author is already providing enough food for both, maybe the friend should bring their own when they want something specific. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're not obligated to share every meal. The friend's behavior is more about manipulation than a legitimate need. The author is setting boundaries, which is important, especially when the roommate isn't contributing. So the answer is B.\n"
