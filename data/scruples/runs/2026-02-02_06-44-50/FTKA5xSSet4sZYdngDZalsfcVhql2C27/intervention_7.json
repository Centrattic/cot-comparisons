He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The friend lives with them, doesn't pay bills or groceries, and uses their car. The main issue is that the friend takes a portion of the author's meals, even though there's enough food for both, just not necessarily the same type. The author usually gives in when the friend stares at them.\n\nHmm, so the friend isn't contributing financially at all. That's a big factor. The author is covering all the expenses, which could be a point of contention. The friend taking food from the author's meal might be seen as taking advantage. But the author says they make sure there's enough food for both, even if not the same type. So maybe the friend is taking more than their share, or the author feels it's unfair to share the specific meal they made.\n\nI think the key points here are mutual respect and boundaries. If the friend is not contributing to the household, it's reasonable for the author to set boundaries about their personal meals. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in is manipulative. The author might be in the right by not sharing, especially since they're the one paying for everything. But on the other hand, since they're best friends, maybe there's an expectation of sharing. However, the friend isn't contributing, so the author isn't obligated to share every meal. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
