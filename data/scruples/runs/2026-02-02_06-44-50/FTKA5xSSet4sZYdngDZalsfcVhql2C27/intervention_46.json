He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, and uses the author's car. The friend often wants a portion of the author's meal, and the author sometimes gives in but not always.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. If the friend isn't contributing financially, that's a red flag. The author is covering all the expenses, which is a lot. Then there's the food sharing. The author says they make sure there's enough food for both, but maybe not the same type. The friend just stares until the author gives in. That passive-aggressive behavior is a problem.\n\nNow, the author's question is whether they're in the wrong for not sharing. The author is setting boundaries, which is important. But the friend isn't respecting those boundaries, using guilt-tripping. The author might feel obligated because they're friends, but they're also being taken advantage of.\n\nFinancial contributions are a big part here. The friend isn't paying anything, so sharing food on top of that might be unfair. The author is already covering all costs, so not sharing their meal isn't the issue. The friend's behavior is manipulative. So the author isn't in the wrong for setting limits. They have the right to decide what they eat, especially if the friend isn't contributing. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
