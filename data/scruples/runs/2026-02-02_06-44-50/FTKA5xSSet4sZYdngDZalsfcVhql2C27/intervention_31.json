He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The context is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, and uses the author's car. The friend sometimes wants a portion of the author's meal, and the author usually gives in but not always. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author is taking care of the friend's basic needs without reciprocation. The friend is living rent-free, getting groceries, and transportation. The friend's request for food portions might be a form of dependence that's becoming a burden. The author is setting boundaries by not always sharing, which the user thinks is wrong, but maybe it's about setting limits on what's fair.\n\nThe key here is whether sharing food is expected when one isn't contributing. If the author is already providing groceries for both, but the friend still wants portions from the author's specific meals, that might be crossing a line. The friend might not have their own meals, but the author is covering groceries. However, the friend's method of asking (staring until compliance) is passive-aggressive and could be disrespectful. The author's refusal might be necessary to stop being taken advantage of.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the agreement was that the author covers food and the friend is supposed to have their own meals, then the friend isn't respecting that. The author isn't obligated to share every meal they prepare, especially if it's for their own taste. The friend's behavior is manipulative, and the author is standing their ground. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
