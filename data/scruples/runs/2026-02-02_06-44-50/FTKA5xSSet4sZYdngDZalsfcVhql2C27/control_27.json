He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, uses their car, and sometimes is loud or smelly. The friend often wants a portion of the author's meal, and the author usually gives in but not always.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend isn't contributing financially to the household, which might be a point of tension. The author is responsible for all the expenses, which could affect their willingness to share food. However, sharing food can be a social norm, especially among friends, but it's not always mandatory.\n\nThe friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in might be seen as pressuring them. But the author is setting boundaries here by sometimes refusing. The key point is whether the author is obligated to share their food. Since the friend is living for free and not contributing, the author might feel it's unfair to share their meals. On the other hand, the friend might expect some level of sharing as roommates, even if they don't pay.\n\nIt's a balance between personal boundaries and expectations in a friendship. The author isn't violating any laws here, but socially, it's a gray area. Since the friend isn't paying for their food, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not sharing. However, the friend's behavior could be problematic if it's constant pressure. The author has the right to their own food without being forced to share, especially since the friend isn't contributing to the household expenses. So, the answer would likely be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
