He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, uses their car, and sometimes is loud or dirty. The main issue is the friend wanting a portion of the author's meal, and the author sometimes gives in but not always.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend is living for free, not contributing financially. That might create an imbalance. The author is covering all expenses, which could be a factor. Now, the friend wants food portions. Even though there's enough food, the author isn't obligated to share every meal. The friend uses passive-aggressive tactics like staring, which isn't respectful. The author is setting boundaries, which is reasonable. So, the author isn't in the wrong because they're not required to share their meals. The friend's behavior is more problematic. Answer B.\n"
