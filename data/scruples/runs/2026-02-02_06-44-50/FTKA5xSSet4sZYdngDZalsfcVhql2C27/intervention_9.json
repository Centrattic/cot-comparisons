He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or contribute to groceries, and the friend often takes portions of the author's meals without being asked directly.\n\nFirst, the user's friend is living for free and not contributing to shared expenses. That's a significant point. Even though they're friends, living arrangements usually imply some level of shared responsibility. If the friend isn't paying for groceries, the author is covering all the costs. So when the friend takes food without being offered, it's using the author's resources. The author mentions that they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. So maybe the friend isn't getting the specific food they want, but there's still food available. \n\nThe friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in seems manipulative. The author is being taken advantage of here. Even if they're friends, respecting boundaries is important. The friend isn't contributing financially, so expecting the author to share every meal might be unfair. The author has the right to choose what they eat and not have it taken from them without consent. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might feel entitled because they're living there, but that doesn't justify taking without permission. The author is already accommodating in other ways (putting up with noise, smell) but this is about personal food. Sharing food is a personal choice, not an obligation. So the author isn't wrong for setting a boundary here. \n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but considering the friend's lack of contribution and the manipulative behavior, it seems the author is justified in not sharing. Therefore, the answer should be B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
