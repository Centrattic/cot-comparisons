He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay for anything, including groceries, and the friend often wants a portion of their food whenever they eat. The author sometimes gives in because of the friend's stare.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend is living there for free and not contributing to expenses. Even though they're friends, living arrangements can create expectations. The main issue is the food sharing. The friend isn't starving, but they want a part of the author's meal every time. The author is making sure there's enough food for both, but not the same type. The friend uses a stare to pressure the author into sharing.\n\nIs the author wrong for not sharing? Well, if the friend isn't contributing to the household, maybe the author isn't obligated to share their personal meals. The author is setting boundaries by not always agreeing to share and ensuring there's enough food for both. The friend's actions might be inconsiderate, using a stare to get what they want. The author is trying to maintain their own space, which is reasonable. However, the fact that the friend is a best friend might make others think they should be more generous. But the friend's lack of contribution is a key point. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries. They might have a right to their own food without constant requests. The friend's behavior is more questionable here. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
