He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they live with their best friend who doesn't pay any bills or contribute to groceries. The friend also uses their car and sometimes is loud or smelly. The main issue is that the friend wants a portion of the author's meal every time they eat, and the author usually gives in. The author is asking if they're the asshole for not sharing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend isn't contributing financially. They live for free, so maybe that's a problem. If the author is the one paying for groceries, then the friend's expectation to get food without contributing could be an issue. The fact that the author makes sure there's enough food for both but not the same type might be a point. The friend is taking without asking directly, just staring until the author gives in. That seems passive-aggressive and maybe a bit manipulative.\n\nBut the author mentions they put up with other things like the friend being loud or dirty because they're best friends. So there's a history of tolerance on the author's part. However, the key point is the food sharing. If the author is the one paying for groceries, they might not be obligated to share their specific meals unless it's part of an agreement. The friend might be taking advantage of the situation, especially since they don't contribute.\n\nOn the other hand, living together often implies sharing resources, like food. But if the friend isn't contributing, maybe the author is being taken advantage of. The author might have a right to eat their own meals without being forced to split. The friend's behavior of staring and manipulating the author into giving up food could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because they're the one providing the food and covering the costs. The friend's actions are more problematic here. The author is setting boundaries by sometimes not giving in, which is reasonable. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
