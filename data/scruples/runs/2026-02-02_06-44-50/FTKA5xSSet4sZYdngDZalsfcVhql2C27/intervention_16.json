He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that they live with their best friend, who doesn't pay bills or groceries, and the friend keeps asking for food from their meals. The author sometimes gives in when the friend stares at them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is living for free, not contributing to expenses, and yet expects to share the author's meals. The author mentions making sure there's enough food for both, but not the same type. The friend uses passive pressure (staring) to get food. \n\nThe key points here are about fairness and boundaries. The friend isn't contributing financially but is taking advantage of the author's generosity. The author might feel they're being taken advantage of, but they also have a friendship to consider. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for not sharing? If the author is making enough food for both, maybe the problem is the friend's behavior. But if the friend is eating the same meals as the author, but just not the same type, maybe the author is already splitting resources. However, the fact that the friend doesn't contribute financially could shift the responsibility. \n\nIf the author is the one providing all groceries and the friend is taking without contributing, then the author isn't necessarily wrong to set boundaries. The friend's behavior of staring to get food is manipulative. The author might be within their rights to say no. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author is making enough food for both, maybe they expected sharing. But the friend's lack of contribution complicates this. The author might feel they're being taken advantage of. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They are maintaining their own meals despite the friend's passive-aggressive tactics. The friend's behavior is problematic, but the author is not obligated to share if they're not comfortable. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
