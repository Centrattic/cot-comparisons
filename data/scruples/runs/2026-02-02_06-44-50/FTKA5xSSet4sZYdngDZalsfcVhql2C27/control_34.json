He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The setup is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, and the author provides transportation. The main issue is the friend wanting a portion of the author's meal every time they eat, usually through a stare-down.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The author isn't obligated to share their food. They mention that there's usually enough food for both, just not the same type. The friend isn't paying for anything, so maybe the author is covering all costs. If the author is making sure there's food available, maybe the friend is just being greedy or taking advantage. But the friend isn't directly asking, just staring until the author gives in. That's passive pressure.\n\nThe author's responsibility here is personal choice. Sharing food isn't a legal obligation unless there's a specific agreement. Since the friend isn't contributing financially, maybe the author feels they're doing more than their share already. But the friend might see living together as an implicit agreement to share resources. However, the author is setting boundaries by sometimes not giving in. It's a matter of mutual respect. If the friend is expecting to eat from the author's meal every time, that might be unreasonable. The author has the right to choose what they eat and when to share. The fact that the friend doesn't outright ask could indicate they're trying to manipulate the situation. The author isn't in the wrong if they're respecting their own needs and boundaries. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
