He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, and the friend often wants a portion of their meal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. So they are providing food, but maybe not the specific dishes they're eating. The friend just stares until the author gives in, which they usually do.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and boundaries. The friend isn't contributing financially, so the author is covering all the costs. If the author is the one paying for groceries, maybe the friend should be responsible for their own meals. But the author does make sure there's enough food, so maybe that's a way of covering the friend's needs without having to share every meal.\n\nThe friend's behavior of staring to get food could be seen as manipulative or taking advantage. The author might feel pressured to share even when they don't want to, which isn't healthy. On the other hand, the author is the one who usually gives in, so they might be the one who needs to set boundaries.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the author not sharing. If the friend is expecting a portion of every meal the author eats, that's a bit much. The author might be doing their part by ensuring there's food available, but the friend's constant request for portions could be crossing a line. \n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They are providing food, and the friend's behavior is more questionable. The author has the right to not share their meal if they don't want to, especially since the friend isn't contributing. However, the situation might be more about the friend's entitlement and the author's boundaries. The answer probably depends on whether the author should be required to share every meal or if the friend's actions are the problem. Since the author is the one paying, maybe they are not in the wrong for not sharing. So the answer would be B.\n"
