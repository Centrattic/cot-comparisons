He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, relies on the author for transportation, and often asks for a portion of the author's meal. The author mentions that they usually give in but now are resisting, and they provided a picture to show the context.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend isn't contributing financially, which is a significant point. If someone is living rent-free and not helping with expenses, that alone could be a problem. Then there's the food sharing aspect. The author is making sure there's enough food for both, but the friend is pressuring them to share, using stares until the author complies. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing. Legally, the food is the author's to eat as they wish. However, friendship and living arrangements often involve mutual respect and boundaries. The friend's behavior of staring until compliance might be manipulative or passive-aggressive. The author isn't obligated to share their food if they don't want to, especially if they're the one covering all the costs. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the friendship. The author puts up with other issues like being loud and smelly. The friend might feel entitled due to the friendship, but that doesn't mean the author has to comply. The key here is boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong if they set boundaries around their personal food. However, the situation is complex because the friend isn't contributing financially. The author might need to address the larger issue of the friend living there for free rather than just the food sharing. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people might say that in a shared living situation, especially with friends, some level of sharing is expected. But if one person is covering all costs, the balance is skewed. The author isn't wrong for not sharing if they're already providing enough food overall. The friend's passive-aggressive behavior to get food could be the real issue here. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong for setting boundaries around their own food. The friend's behavior and lack of contribution might be more problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
