He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, uses the author's car, and has some messy habits. The main issue is that the friend always wants a portion of the author's meal, and the author sometimes gives in but not always. The author is wondering if they're at fault here.\n\nSo, the author's perspective is that they're being taken advantage of. The friend isn't contributing financially, yet expects to share the author's food. The author makes sure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. The friend uses passive-aggressive tactics like staring until the author gives in. The author is conflicted between their friendship and their own needs.\n\nNow, considering the friend's behavior: not paying for anything, relying on the author for transportation, and expecting free food. The author is covering all expenses, which is a big commitment. The friend's request for food portions seems like an additional burden on the author. Even though there's food available, the author might be making different meals, so the friend's expectation to get a portion of the same meal could be unreasonable. Also, the friend's non-verbal pressure tactics (staring) to get what they want might be manipulative.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a living arrangement with a friend, so some level of sharing and accommodation is expected. However, the friend's lack of contribution to household expenses is a significant factor. If the author is covering all costs, they have the right to set boundaries, including what they eat. The friend's behavior might be crossing a line by pressuring the author for food, especially when they're not contributing financially.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is providing a home, transportation, and food. The friend is not contributing, so expecting additional meals could be seen as unfair. The author has the right to say no, especially if it's causing stress. The friend should be responsible for their own meals, perhaps using the available food the author already provides. The author's refusal to share isn't about being stingy but about setting boundaries after being taken advantage of in other areas.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're setting limits in a situation where the friend isn't contributing their fair share. The friend's actions might be the problem here, not the author's refusal to share when they choose to.\n"
