He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud or dirty. The main issue is that the friend wants a portion of the author's meal every time they eat. The author says they make sure there's enough food, but not necessarily the same type. The friend doesn't outright ask but stares until the author gives in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has been tolerating a lot: no financial contribution, the friend's habits, etc. But they do mention providing enough food. The friend's behavior of staring and expecting food might be seen as taking advantage. The author might feel pressured to share, but maybe the friend's constant requests are unreasonable. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. The key points are: the author is the one providing, the friend isn't contributing, the friend's behavior is more about pressure than direct asking. The author is setting boundaries now by not sharing, which might be necessary after tolerating so much. However, the author did mention they often give in, so maybe the friend has a pattern of expecting this. \n\nIs it fair for the friend to expect food without contributing? The author isn't obligated to share. The fact that the friend doesn't pay for anything might mean the author is already doing more than their share. The friend's staring could be seen as manipulative. So the author might be right to set a boundary. \n\nBut maybe the author should have communicated better earlier. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong now for not sharing. If the friend is not contributing and the author is providing, the author isn't in the wrong for not giving up their food. The friend's behavior is more of the issue here. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
