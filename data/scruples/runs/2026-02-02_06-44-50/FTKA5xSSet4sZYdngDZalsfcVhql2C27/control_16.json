He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that their best friend lives with them, doesn't pay any bills or groceries, and often wants a portion of their food. The author sometimes gives in, but they're asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is living for free, not contributing financially, and the author is the one covering all the costs. The friend is also asking for food portions, even though there's usually enough. The author is conflicted about giving in. \n\nThe main question is about the author's responsibility. The friend is making a request, but the author isn't obligated to share. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in might be seen as passive-aggressive, but that's on the friend. The author is the one providing and managing the household expenses. \n\nThe friend isn't paying their share, so the author isn't wrong for not wanting to give up their portion. It's a matter of personal boundaries. The author is taking care of the friend's basic needs (food, housing, transportation) without reciprocation, which could be an issue, but the specific question is about sharing their own meals. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries, especially since they're the one covering all the costs. The friend's behavior is more at fault here.\n"
