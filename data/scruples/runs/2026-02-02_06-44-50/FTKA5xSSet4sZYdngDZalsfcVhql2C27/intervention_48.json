He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (ITA) is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The friend lives with them, doesn't pay bills or groceries, relies on the author for transportation, and sometimes is loud or dirty. The main issue is the friend taking portions of the author's meals, even though there's usually enough food for both.\n\nFirst, the friend isn't contributing to expenses. That's a significant factor. If someone lives with you and doesn't pay for anything, it's reasonable for the author to set boundaries. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in seems manipulative. The author is the one providing everything, so they shouldn't have to share their meals if they don't want to. However, maybe the author has been giving in most of the time, which might make the friend expect it. But the author is now standing their ground, which could be justified given the lack of contribution from the friend. The key here is the friend not contributing to the household, so the author isn't obligated to share food. Also, the friend's actions (staring until they give in) are passive-aggressive and disrespectful. The author is trying to be a good friend despite the friend's negative behaviors. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the author is setting boundaries after tolerating a lot.\n"
