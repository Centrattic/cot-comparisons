He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, and uses the writer's car. The friend often wants a portion of the writer's meal, and the writer usually gives in but is now questioning if they're wrong for not sharing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend isn't contributing financially at all. That's a big point. Usually, roommates split expenses, but in this case, the friend is living for free. The writer is covering all the bills and groceries, which is a significant responsibility. The friend also relies on the writer for transportation, which adds more to the writer's burden.\n\nThen there's the food sharing issue. The friend is asking for a portion of the writer's meal. The writer mentions they always make sure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. So maybe the friend isn't going hungry, but they still want part of what the writer is eating. The friend uses passive-aggressive tactics like staring until the writer gives in. That's a bit manipulative. \n\nThe writer is now questioning if they're wrong for not sharing. The key here is whether the friend has a right to expect food from the writer. Since the friend isn't contributing, it's reasonable for the writer to set boundaries. The friend's behavior is taking advantage of the writer's generosity. The writer is maintaining their own autonomy by not sharing, which is their right. \n\nBut some might argue that since they're friends, the writer should share. However, the fact that the friend isn't contributing to the household makes it more about fairness. The writer is already doing a lot for the friend, so expecting them to share every meal might be too much. The friend's actions could be seen as parasitic, and the writer is protecting their own resources. \n\nIn terms of social norms, roommates usually have some understanding about sharing. If the friend is eating the writer's food without contributing, it's not fair. The writer is justified in not sharing if they feel it's their own meal. The friend's approach of staring until compliance is manipulation and shouldn't be expected to be tolerated. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the writer isn't in the wrong. They're setting boundaries after being taken advantage of, and the friend's behavior is the issue here. The answer should be B.\n"
