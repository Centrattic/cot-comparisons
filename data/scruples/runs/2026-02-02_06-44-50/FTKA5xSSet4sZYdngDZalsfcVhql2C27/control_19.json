He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend who lives with them. The friend doesn't pay for any bills or groceries and uses the author's car. The main issue is that the friend wants a portion of the author's meal every time they eat, and the author feels it's not their fault for not sharing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend lives there for free, doesn't contribute to expenses, and relies on the author for transportation. That's a significant one-sided dynamic. The author is covering all the costs, which might make their stance more understandable.\n\nNext, the food sharing aspect. The friend wants a portion of the author's meal each time. The author mentions they ensure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. The friend uses passive-aggressive tactics like staring until the author complies. The author usually gives in but now is resisting, leading to the question of right or wrong.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the friend isn't contributing financially, so the author's responsibility to feed them might be debatable. The author already makes sure there's food available, so maybe the friend should stick to that. The friend's behavior of staring to pressure sharing could be seen as manipulative. \n\nHowever, sharing a meal can be a social norm, and if the friend is used to that, the author might be expected to share. But given the friend's lack of contribution, maybe the author isn't obligated. The author is managing their own meals and resources, which is their right. The friend's actions (staring, expecting portions) could be considered inconsiderate, especially since they have access to food already.\n\nSo, considering the friend's lack of financial input and the author's efforts to provide groceries, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not sharing their specific meals. The friend might need to either contribute more or respect the author's boundaries.\n"
