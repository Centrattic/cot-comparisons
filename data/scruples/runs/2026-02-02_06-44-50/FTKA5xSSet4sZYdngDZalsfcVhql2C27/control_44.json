He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. They live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, and he often just stares until the author gives him a portion. The author makes sure there's enough food for both, but not the same type.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might be a key point. If the author is covering all the costs, maybe it's unfair to expect them to share every meal. The friend's behavior of staring until they get food could be seen as manipulative or taking advantage.\n\nBut the author mentions they are best friends, so there's a friendship aspect. Maybe the author feels obligated because of the friendship, but it's not their responsibility to feed the friend if they aren't contributing. The friend's lack of payment for food and bills could mean the author isn't at fault for setting boundaries around meal sharing.\n\nAlso, the friend sometimes is loud, dirty, and smelly, yet the author puts up with it. This suggests the author is already tolerating a lot. Not sharing food might be a boundary they need to enforce. The friend's expectation of getting a portion every time might be excessive, especially if it's not the same food. The author is making sure there's enough, but maybe the friend is being inconsiderate by pressuring for the same type or portion.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They are maintaining their own needs and setting boundaries, especially since the friend isn't contributing. The friend's behavior is more problematic. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
