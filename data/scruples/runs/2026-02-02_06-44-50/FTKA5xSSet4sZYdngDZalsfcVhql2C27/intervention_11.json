He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The friend lives with them, doesn't pay bills or groceries, and uses the author's car. The issue is that the friend always wants a portion of the author's meal, and the author sometimes gives in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend isn't contributing financially, so the author is covering all expenses. The friend's behavior of staring until the author shares might be a bit manipulative. The author is setting boundaries by not always giving in, but the friend is pushing for food they didn't pay for.\n\nIs it fair for the friend to expect free meals? Since they don't contribute, maybe the author isn't obligated to share their personal meals. But the author does ensure there's enough food, just not the same type. That could mean the friend has alternatives, but maybe the author is making separate meals. The friend's actions of staring could be seen as pressuring the author, which isn't respectful.\n\nHowever, the author is maintaining some boundaries by not always giving in. So, is the author wrong for not sharing? The friend isn't paying their share, so the author isn't required to provide extra food. The problem might be the friend's entitlement. The author is in a position where they're providing the basics, but the friend is taking more than their share socially. The author's act of not sharing is a way to set limits, which is reasonable. So, I think the author is not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
