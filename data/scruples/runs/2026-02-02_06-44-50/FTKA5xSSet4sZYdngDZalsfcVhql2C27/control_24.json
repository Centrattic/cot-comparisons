He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend who lives with them. The friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries and relies on the author for transportation. The friend often wants a portion of the author's meal, staring until they give in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend lives there for free, so the author is covering all expenses. If the author is making sure there's enough food for both, but maybe not the same type, that's a point. The friend isn't outright asking, just staring. The author usually gives in but is now questioning if they're wrong for not sharing sometimes.\n\nIs it fair for the author to expect the friend to have their own food? Since the friend doesn't contribute financially, maybe the author isn't obligated to share their personal meals. But if there's already enough food in the house, maybe the friend can take from that instead of the author's portion. The author mentions they don't have the same type of food, so maybe the friend is taking different meals. However, if the author is making a specific meal they paid for, they might not be required to share it. The friend's behavior of staring could be seen as passive-aggressive, which is not respectful. The author is balancing their generosity with their own boundaries. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
