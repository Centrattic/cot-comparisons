He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, and the author takes them everywhere. The friend is sometimes loud and dirty, but the author puts up with it because they're friends. Now, the issue is that whenever the author eats, the friend wants a portion of the meal. The author says they don't have the same type of food but ensure there's enough for both. The friend just stares until the author gives in, which they usually do.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is covering all the expenses, which is a big deal. Living with someone who doesn't contribute financially can lead to resentment. The friend is taking a portion each time, even though they have their own food. The author is tired of this, so maybe they're reclaiming their right to their own meals.\n\nBut the friend isn't asking outright. They're using passive-aggressive behavior, which is rude. The author is giving in most of the time, showing they're accommodating. However, the friend's actions might be exploiting the author's kindness. The author making sure there's enough food, but maybe the friend is not eating the same type, leading to the author having to make more. It's a bit confusing. \n\nI think the key points are: the author is covering all costs, the friend is not contributing, and the friend is taking from the author's meals. The author might feel it's unfair since they're already doing so much. The friend should probably be more respectful and not expect sharing if they aren't contributing. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, even if they usually give in. The friend's behavior is the problem here.\n"
