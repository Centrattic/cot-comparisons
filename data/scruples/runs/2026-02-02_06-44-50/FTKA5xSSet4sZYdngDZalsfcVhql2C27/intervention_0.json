He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, and the friend often wants a portion of their meals. The author usually gives in but sometimes doesn't, and the friend just stares until they give in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, which is a big part of housemates. Even though they're friends, fairness matters. If the author is covering all the bills and groceries, then the friend is essentially freeloading, which can create tension. \n\nNow, the food sharing part. The author mentions that they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend wants a portion, which could be seen as taking from the author's personal meal. If the author is cooking something specific, the friend might be expecting to get a share without contributing. The friend's non-verbal pressure (staring) might be manipulative, making the author feel guilty into giving in.\n\nThe author's perspective is that they're tolerating other issues (loudness, messiness) because of friendship. But food is a basic need. If the friend is getting free food without contributing, is that fair? The author might feel that the friend is taking advantage. On the flip side, maybe the friend is just trying to get by and the author's generosity is expected from the friendship.\n\nBut the key point is that the author is the one handling all the costs. If they're cooking for two, they might be doing it out of friendship, but it's not an obligation. The author's right to their own food should be respected. The friend's behavior of waiting until the author gives in could be seen as entitlement. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing their specific meal if they've already ensured there's food available. The friend's expectation to get a portion without contributing is the issue. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
