He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. Let me try to break this down.\n\nThe situation: The author and their best friend live together. The friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, relies on the author for transportation, and sometimes is loud, messy, and smelly. The main issue is that whenever the author eats, the friend wants a portion of their meal. The author usually gives in but now is questioning if they're wrong for not sharing.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. They provided a picture (though I can't see it), which might show the friend's subtle pressure, like the staring mentioned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, which is a red flag. They're freeloading, so maybe that contributes to the friend's entitlement. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in sounds manipulative. The author is trying to be a good friend but is being taken advantage of.\n\nThe question is about the food sharing. The author mentions they ensure there's enough food, but not always the same type. Maybe the friend is taking from the author's specific meal, not the general stock. The author is being asked if they're wrong for not sharing. The friend's behavior of staring and expecting food without being asked could be seen as inconsiderate. The author has boundaries here; if they're making their own meal, they're not obligated to share unless they choose to. The friend's entitlement might be the issue, not the author's refusal.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They're setting boundaries, especially since the friend isn't contributing. The friend's actions are more problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
