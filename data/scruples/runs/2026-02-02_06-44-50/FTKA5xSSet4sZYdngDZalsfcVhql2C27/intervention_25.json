He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, and the friend often asks for a portion of their meal without directly saying so, just staring. The author usually gives in but is now hesitating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics and social norms here. Sharing food in a roommate situation can be a sensitive issue. The friend is living for free, not contributing to shared expenses, and the author is responsible for groceries and transportation. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in seems like passive pressure, which isn't respectful. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is wrong for not sharing. The friend does have food in the house, so the author isn't withholding from a genuine need. The friend is an adult, so maybe they can take the initiative to prepare their own meals instead of relying on the author's portions. The author might feel overstepped by the friend's non-verbal demands. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has been accommodating so far, so maybe they should communicate their boundaries more clearly. The friend might not realize that the author is uncomfortable with the situation. However, the friend's lack of contribution to the household is a red flag. \n\nIn terms of the AITA answer, the friend's behavior is likely the problem here. The author is not obligated to share their personal meal if the friend isn't contributing. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
