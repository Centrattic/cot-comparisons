He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that the friend lives with them, doesn't pay rent or groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud or smelly. The friend often wants a portion of the author's meal, and the author usually gives in but is now questioning if they should.\n\nFirst, consider the living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, so the author is covering all expenses. That's a big deal. If the author is paying for groceries, they might be stretched thin. Sharing food could add to the financial burden. The friend might feel entitled because they're a best friend, but that doesn't justify taking without contributing.\n\nThe friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in is manipulative. It's not direct, so the author might feel pressured. The author might feel obligated to share even if they don't want to, which isn't fair. The author has the right to their own meals without pressure. The friend isn't respecting boundaries, which is a problem in the friendship.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they usually give in. If this happens often, it's a recurring issue. The author might be compromising their own needs to accommodate the friend's habits. That's not sustainable or fair. The friend isn't contributing, so expecting the author to share their food without reciprocation is unfair.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could be inconsiderate if they never share. But the key here is the friend's insistence without contributing. The author is already shouldering the financial load, so not sharing their own meal isn't cruel if they're ensuring there's enough for both. The problem is the friend's entitlement and the pressure to share despite the lack of contribution.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend is the one who's being unfair by not contributing and pressuring the author. The author has the right to set boundaries and take care of their own needs without guilt.\n"
