He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they live with their best friend, who doesn't pay rent or bills and also doesn't pay for groceries. The friend doesn't have a car, so the author takes him places. The friend is sometimes loud, messy, and smelly, but the author puts up with it because they're best friends. Now, the issue is that every time the author eats, the friend wants a portion. The author makes sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend doesn't ask, just stares until the author either gives in or not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend isn't contributing financially. They live rent-free and don't pay for groceries. That's a big red flag. If someone is living with you and not contributing to the household expenses, especially groceries, it's reasonable for the person paying to set boundaries. The author is making sure there's food for both, but maybe the friend isn't contributing in any way. The fact that the friend is taking portions without asking could be seen as taking advantage of the situation. The author might feel pressured to share their meal every time, which could be a lot. \n\nBut then, the author mentions they usually give in. So maybe they feel obligated to share, even though they aren't required to. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in is passive-aggressive and manipulative. The author is in a position where they are the primary provider here, so expecting them to share their food regularly when the friend isn't contributing might be unfair. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author is splitting the cost of groceries, maybe they should be willing to share their meal. But the key point is that the friend isn't contributing financially. The author is bearing all the costs, so it's their right to decide how to use their own food. The friend's behavior is taking without asking, which is inconsiderate. \n\nAnother angle: If the author is cooking for two, maybe they expect the friend to at least ask or express gratitude. The friend's passiveness (staring) is making the author feel like they have to give up their food, which can be stressful. The author might feel like they're being taken advantage of, especially since the friend isn't contributing to the household. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're the one supporting the friend financially and should have control over their own food. The friend's behavior is the issue here. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
