He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The scenario is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay rent or bills, and doesn't contribute to groceries. The friend eats what the author prepares but isn't given the same type of food. The author sometimes gives in to the friend's implied request, but not always.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend isn't contributing financially, which is a big deal. Living in someone else's house for free without paying for anything except maybe utilities is a significant burden. The author is making sure there's enough food, but not the same type. The friend is taking portions without being asked, and the author feels pressured to share.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author is providing for the friend's basic needs without compensation. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in seems manipulative. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially since they're not being asked politely. The fact that the friend doesn't have the same financial responsibility might mean they don't have the same expectations about sharing. \n\nBut then, the author might feel guilty because they're friends. However, it's important to note that even in friendships, there should be mutual respect. The friend's actions could be seen as taking advantage. The author isn't in the wrong for not sharing if they're already covering all expenses and the friend isn't reciprocating. The key point is whether the author is being unreasonable by not sharing when they're not obligated to. Since the friend isn't contributing, the author isn't wrong to draw a line here. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
