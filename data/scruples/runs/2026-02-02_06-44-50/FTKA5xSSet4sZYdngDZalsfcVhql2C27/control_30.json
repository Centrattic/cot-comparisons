He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend who lives with them. The friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud or smelly. The main issue is that the friend takes portions of the author's meals without asking, and the author sometimes gives in but isn't sure if they should.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend doesn't contribute financially, which might create an imbalance. The author is covering all expenses, so maybe the friend's expectation of sharing food is unfair. The friend's actions of taking food without asking could be seen as taking advantage. However, the author and friend are close, so maybe there's an unspoken understanding. But the author is not obligated to share their personal meals. The fact that the friend uses the author's car and doesn't pay rent might make the author feel like they're being taken advantage of in other ways too. The key here is whether the author has to share their own food. Since the author ensures there's enough food for both, maybe they're already providing for the friend. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in could be manipulative. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing their own meal. They can set boundaries, especially since the friend isn't contributing. The answer should be B (No).\n"
