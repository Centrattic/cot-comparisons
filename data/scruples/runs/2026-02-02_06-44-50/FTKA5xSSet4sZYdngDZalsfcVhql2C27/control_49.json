      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the post (AITA) is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the setup: They live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud, dirty, and smelly. But the author puts up with it because it's their best friend. Now, the issue is that whenever the author eats, the friend wants a portion. The author says they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend doesn't ask, just stares until the author gives in or not. The author is now conflicted about not sharing.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing. Let's think about the key points here.\n\nFirst, the friend isn't contributing financially. That's a big factor. If someone is living with you and not paying for any expenses, including groceries, it's fair to question if they should be eating from your meals. The author mentions they make sure there's enough food for both, but maybe the friend is relying on the author to provide for them beyond just having food available. The friend's behavior of staring until they get what they want is also a red flag. Passive-aggressive tactics like that can be manipulative.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to maintain the friendship despite the friend's shortcomings. They might feel obligated to share because of their bond. But does that obligation extend to their own meals? The author might be enabling the friend's lack of contribution by constantly giving in. It's important to set boundaries, especially when it's affecting the author's personal space and meals.\n\nHowever, the author does mention that there's enough food available, which suggests they're not entirely neglecting the friend's needs. But the issue is the expectation that the author should share their specific meal every time. The friend isn't asking politely, which complicates things. The author has the right to say no without guilt, especially since the friend isn't contributing to the household.\n\nIn terms of social norms, roommates usually split expenses and respect each other's belongings. Since this is a living arrangement without financial responsibility from the friend, the author isn't obligated to share every meal. The friend's behavior is more about manipulation than genuine need. The author is within their rights to set boundaries here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They have valid reasons to not share their food, especially given the friend's lack of contribution and the non-consensual pressure tactics. The author should be able to eat their own meals without being forced to share, even if the friend is a close friend.\n"
