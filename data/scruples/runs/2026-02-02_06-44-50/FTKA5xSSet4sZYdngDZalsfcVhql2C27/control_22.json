He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they live with their best friend, who doesn't pay any bills or groceries. The friend wants a portion of the person's meal every time they eat. The person makes sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend just stares until the person gives in.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the living arrangements. The friend is living there for free, not contributing to any costs. That already seems a bit off. But the main issue here is sharing food. The person is making food, and the friend is expecting to get a portion each time. The person isn't obligating themselves to share, but they often do. \n\nNow, the question is whether the person is in the wrong for not sharing. Well, when you live together, especially when one person is paying all the bills and groceries, there might be an unspoken agreement about sharing resources. But food is something personal. Unless they agreed otherwise, the person isn't obligated to share their meal. The friend is being asked to take food that the person has prepared for themselves, which could be seen as respecting their autonomy. \n\nBut then again, if the friend doesn't have their own food, maybe the person should ensure that the friend is also fed. However, the user says they make sure there's enough food for both, even if not the same type. So maybe the friend can eat other things but insists on getting the same meal as the person. The staring until the person gives in seems like manipulation. \n\nThe person is choosing not to share sometimes, which is their right. They aren't forcing the friend to live there or eat without food. The friend's behavior might be the problem here\u2014expecting to take someone else's meal without them being obligated. \n\nSo, considering all that, the person isn't in the wrong. They are within their rights to not share their food, especially since the friend isn't contributing and is being a bit pushy. The answer should be B.\n"
