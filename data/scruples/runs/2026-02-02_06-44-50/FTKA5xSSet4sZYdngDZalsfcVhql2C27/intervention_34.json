He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend who lives with them. Let me break down the context given.\n\nFirst, the author and their friend live together. The friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries and uses the author's car. The author mentions putting up with the friend's loudness, messiness, and smell because they're close. The main issue is that the friend wants a portion of the author's meal every time they eat. The author says there's enough food for both, just not always the same type. The friend doesn't ask directly but stares until the author gives in. The author sometimes gives in, but the question is whether they're at fault for not sharing.\n\nHmm. So the friend isn't contributing financially but expects food. The author makes sure there's enough food, but the friend wants the same type. The friend's behavior is passive-aggressive with staring. The author is conflicted between friendship and their own needs.\n\nNow, the user says they think the author is in the wrong, but wants opinions. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nI need to consider boundaries in a friendship. If the friend isn't contributing and is being entitled, maybe the author isn't wrong to set boundaries. However, the friend is their best friend, so there's a social expectation to share, but that's not absolute. The author is making sure there's food available, which is good, but sharing the same meal might be different. The friend's non-verbal pressure could be seen as manipulative. \n\nThe key points are whether the friend's request is reasonable. Since the friend has access to other food (since there's enough for both), maybe the issue is about the type. The friend might feel entitled, but the author is within their rights to not share if they made their own meal. The author isn't obligated to share, especially if it's causing discomfort. \n\nSo I think the author isn't in the wrong. They\u2019re setting boundaries after being accommodating in other areas. It's about respecting personal space and choices. The friend's behavior is problematic, not the author's refusal.\n"
