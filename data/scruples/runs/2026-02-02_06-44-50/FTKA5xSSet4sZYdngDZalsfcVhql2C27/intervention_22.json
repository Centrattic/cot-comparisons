He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend who lives with them. The friend doesn't pay any bills, doesn't pay for groceries, uses the author's car, and has some habits the author finds annoying. But the main issue is the friend wanting a portion of the author's meal every time they eat. The author sometimes gives in but is now questioning if they should continue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend is living for free, not contributing to expenses. That already sets up a dynamic where the author is shouldering all the costs. The friend's request for food could be seen as taking advantage of that situation. The author mentions making sure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. That might mean there's food available, but maybe not the exact meal the author is eating. \n\nThe friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in sounds manipulative. The author is uncomfortable with this pressure. The question is whether the author is wrong for not sharing. On one hand, the friend isn't paying for the food, so the author might feel it's unfair to share their own meals. On the other, the friend could argue that since they live there, they should have access to the available food. But the author is already providing enough for both, just not the same specific meal each time. \n\nI think the key points are the friend's lack of contribution and the pressure to share. The author isn't obligated to share their personal meals if they're not the same type, especially when the friend isn't contributing. So the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries here. The answer should be B.\n"
