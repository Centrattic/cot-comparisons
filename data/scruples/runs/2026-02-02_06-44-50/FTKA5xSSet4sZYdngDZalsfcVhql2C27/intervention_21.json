He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong regarding not sharing food with their best friend. The friend lives with them but doesn't pay any bills, groceries, or has a car, so the author takes him places. The main issue is that the friend keeps wanting portions from the author's meals even though there's usually enough food for both, just not the same type. The author usually gives in, but now they're questioning whether they should.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangements. The friend is living for free and the author covers all the expenses. That's a significant financial burden on the author. The friend not contributing to groceries means the author is responsible for all the food. But the friend is asking to share the author's meals. Even if there's enough food, it's different types, so maybe the author is making more expensive or preferred items, and the friend is taking from those. \n\nThe act of the friend staring until the author gives in seems manipulative. The author might feel pressured to give in, but if they're the one paying for all the food, they have the right to decide how to use it. Sharing is one thing if they're both contributing, but when one is not paying anything, it could be seen as the author doing a favor. The friend's behavior of not having their own food might be an issue because the author is ensuring there's enough, but maybe not what the friend wants. \n\nThen, the author's perspective: they might be tired of constantly giving in. They're covering all the costs and might want to have their own meals without being pressured to share. The friend's lack of contributing could make the author feel that they're being taken advantage of. On the other hand, the friend might feel that since they live together, sharing food is part of the arrangement. \n\nBut since the friend isn't paying for groceries, the author isn't obligated to share their specific meals. The picture might show the friend taking from the author's plate, which the author is okay with. However, the friend's behavior of staring until they get it suggests a lack of respect for the author's boundaries. The author is within their rights to say no if they're not comfortable with it. So, is the author in the wrong for not sharing? Probably not, because they're not at fault for setting boundaries.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong, but maybe they're considering the friend's perspective. However, in a living situation where one person isn't contributing, the author should be able to decide how their food is used. The friend's actions might be inconsiderate, so the author isn't wrong for not sharing. The answer should be B.\n"
