He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend who lives with them. So, first, let's consider the situation.\n\nThe friend lives with the author, doesn't pay any bills, and also doesn't contribute to groceries. The author is the one taking care of all the expenses and providing food. The issue is that the friend keeps asking for portions of the author's meals, using a passive-aggressive stare, and the author usually gives in but is now questioning if they're wrong to not share.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the financial contributions. Since the friend isn't paying for anything, the author is essentially supporting them. If the friend is taking food that the author paid for, that's a problem. The author is making sure there's enough food for both, but maybe not the same type. So maybe the friend is taking the author's specific meal, which the author prepared for themselves, and that's where the conflict lies.\n\nThe friend's behavior of staring until they get the food could be seen as manipulative. The author has the right to their own meals, especially since they're the one covering all the costs. The friend isn't contributing, so it's unfair to expect the author to share every meal. The fact that the author usually gives in might be because of their friendship, but that doesn't mean the friend is in the right for not respecting personal boundaries.\n\nAlso, the author is putting up with other issues like noise and messiness because it's their best friend. But that doesn't mean they should have to share their food every time. It's about setting boundaries. The friend's actions are taking advantage of the situation where they live for free and get food without contributing.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing their food. They have the right to their own meals, especially when they're the one paying for everything. The friend is the one being inconsiderate here. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
