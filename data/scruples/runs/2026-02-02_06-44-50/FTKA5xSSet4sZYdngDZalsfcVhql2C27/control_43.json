He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The friend lives with them, doesn't pay any bills or groceries, and uses the author's car. The friend wants a portion of the author's meals, but the author sometimes says no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend is living for free, which is a significant point. Usually, if someone is living in a house, they contribute to the household expenses. Since the friend isn't paying, that might affect the dynamics. The author is covering all the costs, which is a lot. \n\nNext, the food sharing issue. The author says they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend doesn't ask directly but stares until the author gives in. That's a bit of passive pressure. The author is uncomfortable with this and sometimes complies. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if the friend is living there without contributing, expecting to share every meal might not be reasonable. The author has the right to their own food. However, since they're best friends, there's a social expectation of generosity. But that shouldn't override the friend's responsibilities. \n\nAlso, the friend's behavior of staring instead of asking is manipulative. It's not a healthy dynamic where one person is pressuring another for food without contributing. The author is setting boundaries by not always giving in, which is their right. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend is not contributing to the household and is trying to take advantage. The author is maintaining their own boundaries, which is justified.\n"
