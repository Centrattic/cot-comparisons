He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they live with their best friend, who doesn't pay any bills or groceries. The friend often wants a portion of the author's meals, even though there's supposedly enough food available, just not the same type. The author sometimes gives in to the friend's silent pressure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, which is a big point. If someone is living with you and not paying for anything, including food, it's reasonable to expect that you have control over your own meals. The fact that the friend is asking for portions of the author's food might be seen as taking advantage of the situation where they're not contributing anything.\n\nThen there's the dynamic of the friendship. The author mentions putting up with other issues like being loud or dirty because it's their best friend. But when it comes to food, the friend is using subtle pressure to get what they want. The author is cooking or buying food, and the friend is taking without contributing. Even if there's enough food in general, the specific meal the author is eating might be something the friend isn't making for themselves. But the author says they make sure there's enough food for both, which could mean they're providing for the friend in other ways.\n\nThe key question is whether the friend has a right to expect a share of the author's meals. If the author is the one who is responsible for buying groceries and paying the bills, then they have the right to decide how their own food is used. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in seems manipulative and could be seen as taking without permission. The author might be overstepping if they're not sharing, but considering the friend isn't contributing, it's the other way around. The author isn't obligated to share their personal meals, especially when the friend isn't contributing to the household expenses. So the author isn't in the wrong; they have the right to their own food. The friend is the one taking advantage here. So the answer should be B.\n"
