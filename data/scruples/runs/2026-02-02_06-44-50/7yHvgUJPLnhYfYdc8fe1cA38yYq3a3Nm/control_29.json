I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through their situation again. They had unprotected sex because a condom broke, and they didn't take Plan B because of PCOS. Then they found out they were pregnant and decided to have an abortion without telling their boyfriend. The main reasons given are the risk of honor killings from their conservative family and the boyfriend's potential reaction.\n\nFirst, the author is worried about their family's violent reaction. They mention honor killings are common in their parents' country, and if their parents found out, it could lead to their death and possibly their boyfriend's as well. That's a really serious situation. So from a safety perspective, getting an abortion might be a way to prevent harm to both them and the boyfriend. Their parents trust them and think they're a virgin, so a pregnancy would be a huge betrayal, leading to severe consequences. That sounds like a life-threatening scenario, which is a strong reason for the decision they made.\n\nThen there's the boyfriend aspect. They said they and the boyfriend had discussed what to do if she got pregnant, and he was eager to be a parent. The author knows he wouldn't have supported the abortion, so they chose not to tell him to avoid conflict. But hiding such a significant decision from the partner might be seen as a betrayal. The boyfriend might feel that they didn't trust him with their life choices, especially since he was ready to take on the responsibilities. The author is now feeling guilty for not involving him and for the abortion itself.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, they prioritized their safety and their family's potential violence, which is a matter of life and death. On the other hand, they made a decision that affects both them and their partner without his knowledge or consent. \n\nI think the key here is the context of the threat from the family. In a situation where not having an abortion could lead to murder, the author's decision is a matter of self-preservation. They also mention they wouldn't be able to keep the baby, which might be due to other pressures, like being forced into an arranged marriage or being sent back to their home country. \n\nHowever, the emotional aspect of the partner's reaction is also important. The boyfriend might have wanted to support them and face the situation together. But the author's decision was made to prevent immediate harm. It's a tough balance between personal safety and relational trust. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, many people might argue that the author did what they had to do to survive. Hiding the abortion was necessary to prevent their family from acting out. But others might say that the partner has a right to know, especially about a child. \n\nI need to weigh these factors. The immediate danger of death is a very strong justification. The boyfriend's support, while valuable, might not have been enough to outweigh the risk of their lives. So the answer might be B, No, the author is not in the wrong because they were protecting themselves from deadly harm and couldn't risk involving the boyfriend due to his potential reaction. But I should make sure there's no other angle where the author's actions are considered wrong despite the circumstances.\n"
