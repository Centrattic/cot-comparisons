I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe situation is that she had a broken condom, didn't use Plan B, got pregnant, and then had an abortion without her boyfriend's knowledge. Her reason is that her conservative family might kill her for being pregnant out of wedlock, and her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the baby. She felt she had to do it to save her own life and avoid being taken back to her home country for an honor killing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Honor killings are a serious issue in some cultures, and the risk she's facing is real and life-threatening. Her decision to abort to protect herself and her boyfriend from violence is a matter of self-defense, even if it's a difficult choice. She also mentions that her boyfriend didn't understand the severity of her parents' reaction, which could mean she made a decision based on her knowledge of her family.\n\nEthically, this is complex. In many places, abortion is a personal choice, especially in cases of life endangerment. However, the question is whether she is \"in the wrong\" for not involving her boyfriend. The story says she believed he would not have supported the abortion and might have put pressure to keep the baby. So, her choice to act alone might stem from a desire to protect both herself and her partner from the consequences she knew would come from her family.\n\nLegally, the situation depends on the country and local laws, but since she had the abortion in a hospital, it was likely legal where she was. The moral aspect is more about her right to make life-altering decisions when facing extreme danger. While some might argue about the importance of shared decision-making in a relationship, her circumstances present a life-or-death scenario where involving her boyfriend could have led to him opposing the abortion, potentially leading to her being discovered by her family.\n\nSo, considering all factors, she's not in the wrong because she acted to save her life and avoid violence, even if it meant making the decision alone.\n"
