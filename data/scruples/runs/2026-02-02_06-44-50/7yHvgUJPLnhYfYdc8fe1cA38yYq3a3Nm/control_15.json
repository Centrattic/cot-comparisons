I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author of this story is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The main points are: she had an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The reason she gave is to avoid an honor killing by her conservative family. She mentions her family is from a place where honor killings are common, and her parents think she's a virgin. She also mentions that her boyfriend didn't know because he would have wanted to keep the baby and not let her have an abortion. She's feeling guilty about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects here. The question is whether she's in the wrong. The situation is complex because it involves personal autonomy, cultural context, and the boyfriend's potential wishes. \n\nOn one hand, she made a decision to have an abortion to protect herself from severe harm, even her life. In many places, self-preservation is considered a valid reason for such a decision. Her safety is a critical factor here. She also mentions that her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the baby, so she withheld the information to prevent him from trying to stop her. That raises questions about honesty and trust in a relationship. But given the life-threatening situation, some might argue that her self-preservation outweighs the need to inform him.\n\nOn the other hand, not informing the boyfriend could be seen as a breach of trust. In a committed relationship, major decisions like this usually involve both partners. However, the boyfriend's potential reaction\u2014trying to prevent her from getting an abortion\u2014could have put her at risk of revealing the pregnancy to her family, which would have dangerous consequences. So there's a conflict between two serious issues: the partner's right to know and the author's safety.\n\nLegally, depending on the country, the decision to have an abortion is often up to the pregnant individual. So from a legal standpoint, she's not necessarily in the wrong. Morally, it's more subjective. Some might argue that lying is wrong, but others might prioritize her safety and autonomy.\n\nThe story emphasizes the high risk of her family finding out. Honor killings are real and severe, so her decision to protect herself is understandable. The boyfriend's belief that her parents wouldn't react as harshly might be due to his different cultural understanding, but the author knows her family better. She had to choose between her life and the relationship, which is a tragic dilemma.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, I think the author isn't in the wrong. Her decision was made under extreme pressure to protect herself from life-threatening consequences. While withholding the information from her boyfriend is a complex issue, the context of potential violence from her family makes her choice understandable. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
