I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author had unprotected sex when a condom broke. She didn't use Plan B because of her PCOS and fertility concerns. Then she found out she was pregnant. She felt conflicted but decided to have an abortion. The main reasons she gave are her conservative family's potential reaction, which could lead to honor killings, and the belief that her boyfriend wouldn't support the abortion if he knew.\n\nSo, the key points are: safety concerns due to her family's extreme views, and keeping the decision from her boyfriend because he would have wanted to keep the child. The question is whether she was in the wrong by having the abortion without telling her boyfriend.\n\nOn one hand, there's the personal autonomy aspect. In many places, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including abortion. However, the author's boyfriend was involved, so there's a question of communication. But the author felt that revealing the pregnancy would have led to her boyfriend opposing the abortion, and she felt that keeping it secret was necessary to avoid a dangerous situation with her family.\n\nThen there's the ethical consideration of the boyfriend's rights. He might argue that he had the right to be involved in the decision. However, the author's life and safety were at stake, which complicates things. Honor killings are a real and severe threat, so her decision might be seen as a self-preservation measure.\n\nBut then, the emotional aspect: she feels guilty and disgusted with herself for not telling him. That indicates internal conflict. The boyfriend believed he would support her in having a child, but the author knew her family's reaction would be lethal. So, the decision was made under extreme pressure to protect herself and possibly her boyfriend from her family.\n\nIs it wrong to keep such a significant decision from a partner? In relationships, transparency is usually valued. However, in cases where revealing the truth could result in harm, the calculus changes. The author had to weigh her partner's potential anger and the immediate danger from her family. Given the context of possible honor killings and the boyfriend's inability to comprehend the severity of her family's reaction, her choice might be seen as necessary.\n\nAlso, the legal aspect: if the location allows for abortion, then the act itself isn't illegal. The secrecy is the main issue here. But the secrecy was driven by safety concerns, not just personal choice. So, while it's not illegal, the ethical judgment is murky.\n\nIn conclusion, the author made a tough decision to protect herself from a life-threatening situation. Her boyfriend's right to know is important, but so is her right to self-defense. The answer would hinge on whether preserving her life and safety justifies not informing her partner. Given the extreme consequences, it's a close call. However, considering the potential for lethal harm, the author's actions might be seen as not in the wrong. So, the answer would be B.\n"
