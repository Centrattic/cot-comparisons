I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me start by reading through their story carefully.\n\nThe author had unprotected sex with her boyfriend when the condom broke. She didn't take Plan B because of her PCOS and a doctor's comment about fertility. She got pregnant, was excited but scared because of her conservative family background where honor killings happen. She mentions her parents would kill her if they found out, referencing a cousin who was beaten. She and her boyfriend had discussed pregnancy before, and he wanted to be a father, but she believed he didn't take her fears seriously. So she had an abortion secretly without telling him, and now feels guilty.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, the context is crucial. She's in a situation where her life could be in danger. If her parents found out, she could be killed. That's a life-or-death scenario. The boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, but she felt he didn't understand the severity of what her family might do. She made a decision to protect herself, even though it meant going against her boyfriend's wishes.\n\nLegally, abortion laws vary, but in many places, it's legal up to a certain point. She was nine weeks along, so likely within the legal window. Her main ethical dilemma is between her boyfriend's right to know and her own safety. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, self-preservation is a strong factor. If she had told her boyfriend, he might have insisted on keeping the baby, which could have led her to being forced to carry it to term despite the risk of her family killing her. In that case, she might lose both her life and her autonomy. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend's right to know about the pregnancy and the abortion is also a consideration. He was part of the situation and had his own desires for parenthood. But given the extreme risk to her life, her decision to prioritize her survival might outweigh that. \n\nAdditionally, the story mentions that she felt disgusted with herself, indicating internal conflict. But her actions were to prevent a much worse outcome. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, while she didn't consult her boyfriend, her decision was made under significant fear and pressure. The boyfriend's lack of understanding about her family's potential actions might mean he wasn't in a position to fully grasp the danger, so her choice to act without his consent could be justified in that context.\n\nSo, considering all factors: her life at risk, the boyfriend's potentially unrealistic view of the situation, and the legal aspect of the abortion, it's likely that the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
