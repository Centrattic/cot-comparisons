I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The woman had a broken condom, didn't take Plan B, got pregnant, and decided to have an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The reasons given are that her conservative family could commit an honor killing if they found out, and her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the child. She felt she couldn't risk her life or her boyfriend's safety. Now she's feeling guilty for hiding it.\n\nThe user initially thinks she's in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to consider legal, ethical, and personal factors. \n\nLegally, abortion is legal in many places, so she's not breaking the law. Ethically, the big issue is the decision to hide the pregnancy and abortion from her boyfriend. She mentions they discussed being parents in the case of a pregnancy, and he would have wanted to keep it. But she felt her life was at risk otherwise. \n\nFrom her perspective, she had to make a life-or-death decision. Her family's reaction is extremely dangerous. She also mentions her boyfriend doesn't understand the severity of the situation, thinking her parents would eventually accept it. She believes he would not support her getting an abortion if he knew. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she made a choice to protect herself from a lethal threat. She didn't involve her boyfriend because she knew he would oppose it, which could lead to conflict. In a relationship, honesty is important, but in a life-threatening situation, survival might take priority. \n\nOn the other hand, her boyfriend had a right to know. It's possible that if he had known, he might have supported her despite the risk, or they could have found another solution together. But she felt she had no other options. \n\nIt's a tough call. The key factors are the imminent danger of death vs. the ethical duty to inform a partner. In a situation where one's life is in danger and the partner can't or won't take it seriously, the decision to act alone for self-preservation might be understandable. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer is B (Not in the wrong). Her actions were driven by a desperate need to survive in a context of extreme violence, and she made the choice she believed was necessary for her safety and her boyfriend's. The decision to hide it was a tragic necessity, not malice.\n"
