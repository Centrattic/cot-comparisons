I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is at fault for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the couple had sex with a broken condom. The author has PCOS, making pregnancy difficult, so she didn't consider Plan B. The pregnancy test came back positive, and she was excited but scared. Her family is conservative, with a history of honor killings. She mentions her cousin was beaten for dating a boy. If her parents found out, they might kill her and her boyfriend. She had previously discussed with her boyfriend that if she got pregnant, he'd support them, but she believes he underestimates her family's reaction. So she decided to have a medical abortion alone and kept it secret.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants opinions. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to determine if her actions make her at fault.\n\nOn one hand, she made a major decision without her partner's knowledge. Abortion is a significant medical choice that involves both parents, so withholding information could be seen as wrong. They had discussed their plans for pregnancy, so he had a right to know. Her secrecy might hurt him, especially if he was supportive.\n\nBut on the other hand, her fear of honor killing is a serious safety concern. She's in a dangerous situation where her life and her boyfriend's life could be at risk. Her decision might be a matter of self-preservation and protecting her partner. In such cases, some might argue that her choice to keep it secret was necessary for survival.\n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. It's a tough balance between respecting a partner's right to be involved in such decisions versus the immediate threat to her safety. In many cases, communication is key in relationships, especially regarding such personal and life-altering decisions. However, the context of potential violence and her family's extreme views complicates this. If revealing the pregnancy would lead to her being killed, her choice to act secretly could be considered a necessary evil to prevent harm.\n\nBut ethically, is she wrong? It depends on the perspective. From a relational standpoint, keeping such a big secret might be seen as a betrayal, even if her intentions were to protect them. However, from a survival and safety standpoint, her decision might be justified. The story doesn't mention if she consulted a healthcare professional or a trusted person, which could have been another way to handle it. But given the circumstances, perhaps she didn't have that option.\n\nSo, considering both the relationship aspect and the safety concern, it's a bit of a grey area. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. If the answer hinges on the ethical implications of her secret decision versus the danger she was in, I might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the threat of violence against her and her partner justifies the secrecy. However, others might argue that the lack of communication is the problem. But given the severity of the risk, her action to protect herself and her partner seems more like prioritizing their lives over the relationship's immediate trust. The answer might be B.\n"
