I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the question is whether she's at fault for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to consider all the factors.\n\nFirst, the background: She had sex with her boyfriend, the condom broke. She didn't take Plan B because of her PCOS and fertility concerns. Later she found out she was pregnant. She was excited but scared because if her conservative family found out, they might kill her for getting pregnant out of wedlock. She mentions honor killings in her family's country, and a cousin was beaten. Her parents don't know she's dating, and if they found out, it would be a death sentence. She also says her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the baby and support her, but she knew he wouldn't understand the danger from her family. So she decided to get an abortion secretly.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the scenario. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, abortion laws vary, but assuming she had the medical right to do so, the legality isn't the main issue here. The moral dilemma is about her decision to keep it secret from her boyfriend. Her boyfriend supported having kids, and she withheld the pregnancy and the abortion. She did it to protect herself from her family's violence. \n\nOn one hand, she might be seen as making a choice without her partner's input, which can be considered a breach of trust. But on the other hand, the alternative was a life-threatening situation for her. Her boyfriend didn't realize the severity of the family's potential reaction. She believed she was protecting herself and possibly her boyfriend from her family's violence. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If we consider her actions as necessary for self-preservation and safety, then maybe not. If we prioritize the relationship and transparency, then maybe she is. But given the extreme consequences (possible death) and that she didn't believe her partner could handle the reality, her decision might be justified. \n\nI think in this context, the author's safety is a primary concern, so she isn't in the wrong. Answer B."
