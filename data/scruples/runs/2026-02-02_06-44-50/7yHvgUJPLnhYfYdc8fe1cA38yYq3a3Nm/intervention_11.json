I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about getting an abortion without telling the boyfriend. The key points are the risk of honor killing from a conservative family, the boyfriend's desire to keep the child, and the author's decision to act alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical dimensions. The author felt the abortion was necessary to prevent a life-threatening situation due to family violence. Honor killings are a serious issue, and the author's safety and life are at stake. On the other hand, the boyfriend had a right to know about the pregnancy and the decision, since it's his child too. The author thought he wouldn't agree to the abortion, so she acted to protect herself, but that might have violated their trust and his autonomy.\n\nBut in this context, the author's primary concern was her survival. If revealing the pregnancy would lead to her death or severe harm, that's a critical factor. The boyfriend's wishes are important, but if the situation is life-threatening, the author's decision to prioritize her safety could be justified. However, there's also the aspect of not communicating with someone important in the pregnancy. Maybe there's a middle ground, like seeking a third party to mediate, but the author might not have had that option or trusted anyone else.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Ethically, it's a tough call. If the boyfriend had been informed and had the chance to support her, maybe things would have been different. But given the risk of her family's reaction, keeping it secret might have been a protective measure. It's possible that the author made a necessary choice under extreme pressure, even if it meant lying to her partner. So, the answer might be B, not in the wrong, considering the life-threatening circumstances. But I should also acknowledge the complexity of relationships and the importance of communication. However, the immediate danger to her life takes precedence over the relational ethics here. So I think the answer is B.\n"
