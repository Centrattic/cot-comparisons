I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the abortion story is in the wrong. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the woman had an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The main reasons she gives are her conservative family's potential violent reaction, including honor killings, and the boyfriend's desire to keep the baby. She felt she had to protect herself and him by hiding the pregnancy and the abortion.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is seeking another opinion. I need to consider different perspectives. On one hand, the boyfriend was kept out of a major decision that affects him. He wanted to be part of the child's life, so not informing him could be seen as a breach of trust. On the other hand, the woman was facing extreme danger from her family. Her safety and life were at risk. In some legal and ethical frameworks, self-preservation and protection from violence are valid reasons for making such a decision.\n\nAlso, the societal context matters. In her country, the risk of honor-based violence is real and severe. She might not have felt she could discuss it with her boyfriend because he didn't grasp the severity. There's also the aspect of bodily autonomy. Even though the boyfriend is the father, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is typically considered the pregnant person's right. However, the secrecy complicates that.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. The author feels guilty and conflicted, which shows she's struggling with the decision. Her intention was to protect both herself and her boyfriend, which adds a layer of moral justification. But withholding such life-altering information can strain a relationship, even if the intent was to protect it.\n\nLegally, in many places, the woman has the right to make reproductive choices. However, the context of her family's threats introduces a different dimension. If she had involved her boyfriend, it might have put him in danger too, which he didn't anticipate.\n\nSo weighing these factors: her safety and the risk of violence versus the boyfriend's right to know. The decision was made to prevent a much greater harm. Ethically, some might argue that she was justified in prioritizing her life and safety. Others might focus on the betrayal of trust with her partner.\n\nBut in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's not a straightforward yes/no. However, the question seems to lean towards a judgment. If the answer must be A or B, considering the life-threatening circumstances, the author might not be in the wrong. The answer would likely be B.\n"
