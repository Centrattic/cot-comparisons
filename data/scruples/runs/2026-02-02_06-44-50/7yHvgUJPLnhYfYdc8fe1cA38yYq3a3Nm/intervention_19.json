I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves getting an abortion without telling her boyfriend, mainly because of the risk of an honor killing from her conservative family. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects. The woman faced a life-threatening situation if her family found out. Honor killings are a serious issue, and her decision was to protect herself and her boyfriend. But she also made the decision without her boyfriend's knowledge, which he might see as a betrayal since he wanted to parent the child. \n\nOn one hand, her safety is paramount. She had a valid reason to avoid putting herself and her partner in danger. The cultural context is crucial here; the threat of violence is real and severe. On the other hand, keeping this from her boyfriend could strain their relationship. However, she believed he wouldn't understand the severity of the situation, which adds complexity.\n\nLegal and moral rights to make reproductive choices are also a factor. In many places, a woman has the right to decide about her own body. But the emotional impact on the boyfriend is another layer. He might feel hurt or disrespected. \n\nThe key here is weighing her self-preservation against the trust in the relationship. Since the alternative was a potential death sentence, her choice seems necessary for survival. While withholding information isn't ideal, the circumstances are extreme. So, I think she's not in the wrong.\n"
