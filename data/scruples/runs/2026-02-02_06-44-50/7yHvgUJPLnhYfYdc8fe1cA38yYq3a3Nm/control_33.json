I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe user is a woman who had a one-night stand with her boyfriend, and the condom broke. She didn't use Plan B because of her PCOS and was more worried about STDs. A month later, she found out she was pregnant. She's from a conservative family where honor killings are common. Her parents would kill her if they found out about the pregnancy, and her boyfriend wouldn't let her have an abortion if he knew. So she decided to get an abortion secretly. Now she's feeling guilty and is asking if she's the asshole (AITA) for doing this without telling her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, abortion is a legal option, especially in early stages. The woman had a medical abortion at nine weeks, which is within the typical legal window in most jurisdictions. But the key here is the context of her family's cultural background and the risk of honor-based violence. She's in a life-threatening situation if her family finds out, so her decision might be seen as a matter of self-preservation.\n\nThen there's the relationship aspect. She didn't tell her boyfriend because he would have wanted to keep the baby. She believed that if he knew, he would try to stop her from getting the abortion. So she made the choice without consulting him, which could be seen as breaking trust. But she also thought that informing him might lead to her being forced to keep the child, which would put her life at risk due to her family's reaction.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the question is about autonomy versus partnership. The woman had the right to make decisions about her own body, especially under life-threatening circumstances. Her boyfriend's desire to keep the child, while understandable, doesn't override her right to protect herself from violence. On the other hand, withholding such a significant decision from a partner could be seen as a breach of trust, but given the context, it's a complex situation where her survival is at stake.\n\nCulturally, the fear of honor killings is real and severe. In some countries, families do take extreme measures to maintain perceived honor, even leading to murder. The woman's decision to protect herself from that danger is a valid reason for her actions. Her boyfriend's inability to comprehend the severity of her family's potential reaction adds another layer, as he might not fully grasp the life-threatening nature of the situation.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the woman's decision was made out of necessity to protect her life. While it's true that she didn't inform her boyfriend, the context of imminent danger from her family and the boyfriend's opposition to the abortion make her choice understandable. The priority here is her safety and autonomy. Therefore, she's not in the wrong, so the answer should be B.\n"
