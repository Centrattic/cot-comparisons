I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation involves a serious cultural context where the family is extremely conservative, with a history of honor killings. The author's parents could potentially kill her if they found out about the pregnancy, which would also put her boyfriend in danger. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral implications. The author made a life-saving decision for herself based on her knowledge of her family's potential reaction. She believed that keeping the child would result in her death or severe harm. On the other hand, she didn't share this with her boyfriend, who was supportive of having children and would have wanted to keep the baby. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's decision was to protect her own life and safety. However, the secrecy involved might be seen as a betrayal of trust. But given the life-threatening consequences, many might argue that her self-preservation justifies the secrecy. \n\nLegally, the situation varies by location, but the question is more about right and wrong in a moral sense. The key points are her fear of honor violence, her knowledge of her family's actions, and her boyfriend's differing perspective. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the preservation of one's life is a primary concern. The author's decision to prioritize her safety over her boyfriend's wishes could be seen as necessary. However, some might argue that she should have found a way to involve him despite the risks. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because her actions were to prevent imminent harm to herself and others. The secrecy was a means to an end to avoid a much greater tragedy.\n"
