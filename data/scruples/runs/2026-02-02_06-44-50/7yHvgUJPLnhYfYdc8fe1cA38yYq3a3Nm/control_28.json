I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author has PCOS and was worried about fertility, so she didn't take Plan B. Then she found out she was pregnant. The key points here are her conservative family background with a history of honor killings. She's afraid that if her parents found out, she and her boyfriend could be killed. She also mentions that her boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, so she chose to hide the pregnancy and have an abortion to protect them both.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to consider ethical, cultural, and personal aspects. Legally, abortion is a sensitive issue, but the question is more about moral wrongdoing. She believed her life was in danger if her parents discovered the pregnancy. Honor killings are real and severe, so her fear is valid. She had to act to protect herself and her boyfriend from imminent harm.\n\nOn the other hand, her boyfriend had the right to know and be involved in the decision. However, the author thought he wouldn't let her have an abortion and might not comprehend the severity of her parents' reaction. She had to make a choice under pressure. Her primary motivation was self-preservation and preventing harm, which is a strong ethical justification. \n\nBut then, is hiding the decision making her in the wrong? It's a tough call. In an ideal situation, open communication is key. However, given the life-threatening context, her actions were a necessary precaution. The boyfriend's feelings about not being informed are important, but the author's safety is paramount. So, I think the answer here leans more towards B (No), because the decision was made to prevent serious harm, though it's a morally grey area. The question is about being in the wrong, and her actions were driven by survival and protection, not malice.\n"
