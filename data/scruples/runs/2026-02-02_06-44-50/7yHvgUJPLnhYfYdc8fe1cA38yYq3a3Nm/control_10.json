I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, there was a condom break, leading to pregnancy. She didn't take Plan B because of PCOS making pregnancy hard. Her main worry was STDs initially. The pregnancy test was positive, which made her feel a mix of emotions. She comes from a conservative family where honor killings are common. If her parents found out about the pregnancy, it would be dangerous for her and her boyfriend. She mentions her cousin was beaten for associating with a boy, so the risk is real and severe.\n\nShe and her boyfriend discussed what they'd do if she got pregnant. He wanted to be a father and get a job and apartment. But she knew her parents would react violently, and he didn't believe her about how bad it would be. She thought he'd prevent her from getting an abortion. So she decided to have the abortion secretly, feeling guilty afterward.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? The question is about moral responsibility. In many places, abortion is a personal choice, but the context here is life-threatening due to her family's potential reaction. She chose to protect herself from a dangerous situation. However, she didn't inform her partner, who wanted to support the child. So there's a conflict between her safety and the partner's right to know.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the abortion was legal in her country, it's a personal decision. But given the risk of honor killing, her choice might be seen as necessary for self-preservation. On the other hand, her partner had a right to be involved in the decision. But if he wouldn't have supported her choice, maybe keeping it secret was necessary to carry out the abortion. There's also the emotional aspect; she feels guilty, indicating internal conflict.\n\nThe key points are her safety versus her partner's rights. Since her parents would kill her for being pregnant outside of marriage, her decision might be justified as self-defense. Also, the boyfriend's lack of understanding of the severity adds to her rationale for keeping it secret. So the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because she acted to protect her life and safety, which is a higher priority than the partner's wishes in this context.\n"
