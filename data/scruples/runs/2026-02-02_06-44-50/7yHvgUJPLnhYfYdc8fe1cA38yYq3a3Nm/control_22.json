I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about an abortion she had without her boyfriend's knowledge. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key facts: The couple had sex, the condom broke, and the woman got pregnant. She has PCOS, which makes pregnancy difficult. She was worried about STDs but didn't take plan B. She found out she was pregnant and decided to have an abortion because her conservative family might subject her to an honor killing. She didn't tell her boyfriend because he would have wanted to keep the baby, and she feared he didn't understand the severity of her family's potential reaction.\n\nNow, the question is whether she was in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The answer hinges on ethical, legal, and situational factors.\n\nLegally, in many places, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including abortion. So from a legal standpoint, she's probably okay. Ethically, it's more complex. The boyfriend wanted the child, and she withheld the information. That could be seen as a betrayal of trust. However, her decision was based on life-threatening circumstances for herself and possibly her boyfriend, given the family's reaction. Honor killings are real and severe, so her decision might be seen as self-preservation.\n\nThe boyfriend's perspective is that he would have supported her and the child. But if he didn't fully grasp the danger from her family, maybe his understanding was limited. She might have felt that involving him would put both of them at risk. So from her viewpoint, it was a matter of survival versus the relationship.\n\nIn terms of moral wrongness, some might argue that she should have included her partner in the decision, but given the potential consequences of him knowing, she might have calculated that as too risky. The question is whether her actions were justified given the extreme circumstances. Honor killings are a serious threat, and in such contexts, her choice might be viewed as necessary to prevent a greater harm.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that even in such situations, transparency with the partner is important. However, considering her family's history and the potential for violence, her decision could be seen as a necessary evil to protect herself and her boyfriend.\n\nSo weighing these factors, the answer is likely B (No, she's not in the wrong) because her decision was made to prevent a dire outcome, and she had a valid fear for her safety. The legal right to choose, combined with the life-threatening family situation, supports that she wasn't in the wrong.\n"
