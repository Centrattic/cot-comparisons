I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. First, the situation is that she had a pregnancy and decided to have an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The key points to consider are the reasons she had for doing so and the context of her life.\n\nShe mentions coming from a very conservative family where honor killings are common. If her parents found out about her pregnancy, it could result in her death and possibly harm to her boyfriend. She also says that her boyfriend would not support an abortion and would have wanted to keep the baby. So, she made the decision to have the abortion secretly to protect herself and her boyfriend from her family's violent reactions.\n\nNow, the question is whether she is in the wrong. On one hand, she didn't inform her boyfriend, which could be seen as a breach of trust in their relationship. However, she believed that if she told him, he would fight to keep the baby, going against her wishes and the dangerous family situation. She felt that keeping it a secret was necessary to prevent both her and her boyfriend from facing life-threatening consequences. \n\nLegally, abortion is a sensitive topic and varies by location, but given the context of her needing to protect her life, that aspect might not be the main ethical consideration here. The primary issue is her decision-making in the face of extreme personal safety threats. Her actions were driven by self-preservation and the safety of her partner. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is important, but so is safety. If telling her boyfriend would have forced him into a situation where he might have to choose between her life and his own beliefs, or if it would have led to their deaths, her choice to act alone might be justified. The emotional toll on both of them is significant, but she weighed the risks and made a decision she believed was necessary to survive. \n\nTherefore, considering the extreme danger involved, her actions were likely a necessary choice to prevent imminent harm. The author isn't in the wrong.\n"
