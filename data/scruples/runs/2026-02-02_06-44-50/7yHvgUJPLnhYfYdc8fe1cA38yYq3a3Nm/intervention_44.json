I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves an abortion done in secret because of the risk of an honor killing from a conservative family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects here. The author decided to have an abortion without telling her boyfriend because she believed her family would kill her if they found out. Her boyfriend wanted to keep the child, but she thought he didn't understand the severity of her parents' potential reaction. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author's decision to abort for self-preservation, the secrecy involved, and her boyfriend's differing opinion on the matter. \n\nOn one hand, she made a life-saving decision for herself, avoiding a possible honor killing. On the other hand, she didn't inform her partner, which could be seen as breaking trust. But the context here is extremely high stakes\u2014her life is at risk. The boyfriend's desire to parent doesn't override the immediate danger she faces. \n\nI should also consider the legal and cultural context. Honor killings are real threats in some cultures, and her decision might be a necessary act of self-defense. Secrecy in this case could be justified to protect her life and her partner's safety. The boyfriend's belief that her parents would eventually accept it is naive, but that's his perspective. \n\nThe author feels guilty and conflicted, which shows she's wrestling with her decision. The question is whether she was wrong to act in her own survival without her partner's consent. In situations of extreme danger, individuals might prioritize their safety, even if it means making a difficult choice alone. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because the decision was made to protect her life, and the boyfriend's wishes couldn't override the immediate threat.\n"
