I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author and her boyfriend had sex, and the condom broke. She didn't take Plan B because of her PCOS and the doctor's advice. Then she found out she was pregnant. She was excited but scared because of her conservative family's potential reaction, which could lead to an honor killing. She also mentions that her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the baby and not let her have an abortion. She decided to get an abortion to protect herself and her boyfriend from her family, but kept it a secret. Now she's feeling guilty and wondering if she did the right thing.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent, safety, and the boyfriend's right to know. On one hand, the boyfriend believed he would be a father and wanted to support them. On the other hand, the author had to make a decision to protect her life and his from her family's violent tendencies. \n\nThe question is whether keeping it a secret makes her wrong. In many contexts, making a decision about one's own body is a personal choice, especially when there's a risk to her life. However, not informing the other parent could be seen as a betrayal or lack of trust. But in this case, the author had valid reasons to believe that the boyfriend wouldn't respect her decision to abort, leading to potential conflict and endangerment. \n\nLegally and ethically, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is typically the woman's right, even if it's done without the partner's knowledge, especially in life-threatening situations. The author's safety and the boyfriend's safety were at stake, which adds a layer of necessity to her decision. \n\nSo, considering the circumstances, the author's actions were made to prevent harm and protect both herself and her boyfriend. While it's understandable that the boyfriend might feel hurt, the author's choice was likely made with the best intentions given the context. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
