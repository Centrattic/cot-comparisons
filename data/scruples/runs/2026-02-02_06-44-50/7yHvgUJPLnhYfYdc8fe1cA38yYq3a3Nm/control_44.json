I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. So, the user is asking if they're at fault for having an abortion without telling their boyfriend, especially given the cultural context and risks involved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main factors. The author had a pregnancy, and due to her conservative family background, there's a real fear of honor-based violence. She mentions her cousin was beaten for associating with a boy, and she believes her family would kill her if they found out about the pregnancy. That's a life-threatening situation. If she told her boyfriend, he wouldn't have supported an abortion and would have wanted to keep the baby. But she felt that doing so would put both her and her boyfriend in danger, not just from her family but also because her parents would take her to their home country where she might be killed. \n\nThe boyfriend had said he'd support her if she got pregnant, but he didn't understand the severity of her parents' potential reaction. So she decided to keep it a secret and have the abortion to prevent a much worse outcome. Now, she's feeling guilty and is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the decision involves a conflict between personal autonomy and relationship betrayal. On one hand, she was making a choice to protect herself from potential murder, which is a matter of life and death. On the other hand, she didn't involve her partner, which he would have wanted to be part of. However, her perception is that involving him would lead to him opposing the abortion and not comprehending the danger they'd face.\n\nLegally, it's about the right to make decisions about one's own body. In many places, the woman has the legal right to terminate a pregnancy, especially within certain gestational limits. However, the ethical dimension here is more about the relationship and the safety concerns.\n\nThe key here is the imminent danger of death. If she had told her boyfriend, he wouldn't have supported the abortion, and he might have tried to convince her to keep the baby. But in doing so, she would have exposed herself and possibly him to lethal violence from her family. The author's decision was made to prevent a far more severe consequence. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing her survival over being honest with her partner. In such extreme circumstances, many would argue that self-preservation and protection from lethal harm take precedence. The boyfriend's right to know is balanced against the risk of death. Since the author believed that telling him would lead to them both being in danger, her choice might be seen as justified to avoid an even graver outcome. The author isn't in the wrong because she was acting to protect her life and the life of her partner from a family that is perceived to be capable of honor killings.\n"
