I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about having an abortion without telling her boyfriend because of the risk of an honor killing from her conservative family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had an accidental pregnancy with her boyfriend. They had discussed the possibility of having a child before, and the boyfriend wanted to be a father. However, the author's family is extremely conservative, with a history of violence against women for premarital relationships. The author feared that if her family found out about the pregnancy, they might kill her and the boyfriend. She decided to have an abortion secretly to prevent that outcome.\n\nNow, the ethical dilemma here is complex. On one hand, the author made a decision without the boyfriend's knowledge or consent, which could be seen as violating trust. The boyfriend wanted to be a parent and would have opposed the abortion. But on the other hand, the author is facing a life-threatening situation where her family might commit an honor killing. Her decision might be seen as a necessary action to protect her life and the boyfriend's life, even if it meant acting alone.\n\nLegal and moral perspectives vary. In some places, abortion is legal, and the decision is up to the pregnant person. However, involving a partner in such a significant decision is usually expected. But given the extreme risk of violence from her family, the author's choice might be seen as a survival mechanism. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not discussing it with her boyfriend. In relationships, major decisions affecting both partners usually require communication. However, the author believed that if she told her boyfriend, he wouldn't have proceeded with the abortion, leading to the risk of her family finding out. There's a conflict between personal autonomy and relationship trust here.\n\nSome might argue that she should have found another way to involve her boyfriend while keeping their situation secret, but considering the severity of the threat, she might not have had that time or felt it was safe. The boyfriend's well-being is also at stake if the family found out. \n\nIn terms of cultural context, the author's family's extreme views add a layer of coercion and fear. Her decision to abort could be seen as a way to escape an oppressive family structure, which might be supported in some ethical frameworks. However, the secrecy aspect complicates it because it affects the boyfriend's autonomy and their relationship dynamic.\n\nSo, considering all angles, it's a tough call. The author prioritized her safety and her boyfriend's safety, which is understandable. But withholding such a significant decision from her partner is a breach of trust. However, given the life-threatening context, some might argue it's justified. The answer might depend on whether the wrong is judged based on the action (abortion without consent) or the circumstances (life-threatening risk).\n"
