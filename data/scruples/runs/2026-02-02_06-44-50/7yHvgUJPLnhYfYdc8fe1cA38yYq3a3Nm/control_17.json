I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author had sex with her boyfriend, the condom broke, and she didn't take Plan B. She mentions having PCOS, which makes getting pregnant harder, so she was worried about that more than an unwanted pregnancy. Later, she found out she's pregnant, was happy but scared because her conservative family might react violently with an honor killing. She also told her boyfriend they'd talk about having kids, and he wanted to be a father. However, she decided to have an abortion secretly because she knew if he found out, he wouldn't let her do it, and she's afraid of her parents. Now she's feeling guilty and wants to know if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, abortion is legal, so that's a point. But the main issue here is the author's safety and family context. She's in a situation where her family might kill her if they find out she's pregnant out of wedlock. That's a severe risk. Also, her boyfriend didn't understand the gravity of the situation, thinking her parents would just be mad but not do anything drastic. The author, knowing her parents better, made the decision to protect herself. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, is she in the wrong for not informing her boyfriend? Well, he would have wanted to be a father and would have opposed the abortion. But she took the decision to protect her life. The question is about autonomy versus shared decision-making. She made a choice in a high-stakes situation where her life is at risk. The boyfriend's reaction isn't the main issue here; the critical factor is her safety and survival. \n\nHonor killings are a real and serious problem in some cultures, so her fear isn't unfounded. She had to weigh the immediate risk to her life against the boyfriend's wishes. Since she's the one facing the potential violence, her decision to act in self-preservation might be seen as necessary. \n\nBut some might argue that she should have been honest with her boyfriend, even if he didn't fully grasp the danger. However, the post says he didn't believe her about what her parents could do. If she had told him, he might have insisted on keeping the baby, which could have led her to be forced to go through with it, risking her life. So her secrecy was a protective measure. \n\nAnother angle: she carried the pregnancy, so the decision to terminate is hers. But the boyfriend has a right to know if he's a father. Yet, his right to know is secondary to her right to safety. Also, the emotional impact on her is significant, with deep guilt, which suggests the decision was hard and not made lightly.\n\nPossible factors to consider: The legality of the abortion in her location, the severity of the threat from her family, and whether she had other options. If the abortion was legal and necessary to prevent her death or severe harm, then her action is understandable. The boyfriend's reaction is hurt, but the primary issue is her survival. \n\nIn many cases, people are not in the wrong for making life-saving decisions under extreme pressure, especially when others don't comprehend the risks. She had to choose between her life and her relationship, and her choice was to protect herself. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No), she's not in the wrong. The decision was made to prevent a grave danger, and she acted to protect her life despite the personal costs.\n"
