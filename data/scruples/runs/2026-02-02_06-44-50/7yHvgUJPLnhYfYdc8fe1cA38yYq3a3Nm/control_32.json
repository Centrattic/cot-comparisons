I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if they're at fault for having an abortion without telling their boyfriend. The context is that they had sex, a condom broke, and she became pregnant. She didn't use Plan B because she has PCOS and was told it would be difficult to get pregnant. She felt excited but terrified because she can't keep the baby due to her conservative family's potential reaction, which could lead to an honor killing. Her boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, but she hid the pregnancy and had an abortion alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The woman made a decision to have an abortion to protect herself from a life-threatening situation (honor killing). Her parents are extremely conservative and would not accept her being pregnant from a relationship. She also mentions her cousin was beaten, so it's a real fear. The boyfriend wanted to stay with her and the child, but she thought he wouldn't understand the severity of her parents' reaction. \n\nLegally, in many places, having an abortion is a woman's right, especially in cases where the pregnancy is not viable or there's a risk to her life. However, the context here is about the moral and ethical responsibility towards her partner. She hid the pregnancy and the abortion from him. But the key point here is her own safety. If she had told him, he might have tried to proceed with the pregnancy, which could put her in danger. She had to protect herself.\n\nIs she in the wrong for not informing him? Well, he was part of the situation, but her decision was based on her own survival. She might feel guilty, but the circumstances are extreme. Also, the boyfriend might not have been able to support her in hiding the pregnancy, given his initial reactions. Her safety and life are paramount in this case. \n\nHonor killings are a serious issue, and in such contexts, the woman's life is at stake. The decision to have an abortion was to prevent her own death and her partner's potential harm. So, the author's actions were self-preservation. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
