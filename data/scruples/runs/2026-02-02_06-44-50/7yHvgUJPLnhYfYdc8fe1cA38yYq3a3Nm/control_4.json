I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation. The person had an abortion without their boyfriend's knowledge because they feared being subjected to an honor killing by their family if they found out about the pregnancy. The boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, but the author knew that revealing the pregnancy would lead to their family taking extreme actions, including killing her and their boyfriend. The author felt conflicted because they wanted the baby but knew they couldn't risk their lives.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal and ethical aspects. Abortion laws vary, but in many places, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body. The author made a choice based on their own safety and the safety of their partner. However, they didn't inform their boyfriend, which is where the moral question comes in. Did they have a duty to consult with their partner?\n\nThe boyfriend believed they would be able to handle the pregnancy and support each other. But the author had specific knowledge about their family's extreme reactions, which the boyfriend didn't understand. The author's decision was based on survival. Honor killings are real and severe, so the risk was high. The author might have felt that involving the boyfriend would put him in more danger if he tried to stand by them, leading to the family taking action.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author had to choose between their life and the life of the unborn child. In many ethical frameworks, self-preservation is a fundamental right. The author also considered the broader implications for their family, knowing that an honor killing would not only affect them but also their boyfriend. The decision was made to prevent immediate and severe harm.\n\nHowever, some might argue that not consulting the partner is wrong, as it's their child too. But in this context, the author might have believed that involving the boyfriend would not only be ineffective (since he didn't understand the family's threats) but could also lead to a confrontation that would escalate the danger. The author's knowledge of their family's behavior is crucial here; they are the one living with that reality daily.\n\nSo, the key points are the author's right to autonomy, the severe danger posed by their family, and the boyfriend's differing perspective. The decision was made to prevent a life-threatening situation. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they prioritized their safety and the safety of their partner in a situation involving extreme violence and coercion.\n"
