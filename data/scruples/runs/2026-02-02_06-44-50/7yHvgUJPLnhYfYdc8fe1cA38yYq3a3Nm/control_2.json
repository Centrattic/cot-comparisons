I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves an abortion done secretly by the author to avoid an honor killing from her conservative family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's family is from a place where honor killings are common, and her parents would be extremely violent if they found out she's pregnant. Her cousin was beaten for dating, so the risk is real. She had unprotected sex when a condom broke, leading to pregnancy. She had discussed potential scenarios with her boyfriend, who wanted to keep the child, but she felt he didn't understand the family's reaction. She decided to have an abortion without telling him because she believed he would have wanted to keep the baby and fight for it, but she couldn't risk her life or her boyfriend's.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, this is complex. In many places, abortion is a personal choice, but the secrecy involved might be a point of contention. However, the context is life-threatening for her. Her decision was based on survival and the real danger of an honor killing. The boyfriend's reaction is also a factor\u2014she felt he wouldn't understand the severity, so she made the choice to protect them both.\n\nLegally, depending on the country, the legality of the abortion could matter, but the question is more about moral wrong. Ethically, when someone's life is in danger, self-preservation is often justified. She didn't want to have the child but felt it was necessary to save her life. Also, the boyfriend's wishes don't override her right to make decisions about her own body, especially in life-threatening situations. The key here is the immediate threat to her safety and the lack of alternative support from her family. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. Her actions were a necessary choice to protect her life and her partner's from violent retaliation. The boyfriend's feelings are valid, but her survival takes precedence in this scenario.\n"
