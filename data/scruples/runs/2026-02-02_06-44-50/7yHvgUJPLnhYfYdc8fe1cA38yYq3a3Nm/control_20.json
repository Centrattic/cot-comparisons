I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The woman had a broken condom, didn't take Plan B, got pregnant, and then had an abortion secretly. The main reasons she gave are her conservative family's potential violent reaction, including honor killings, and her belief that her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the baby.\n\nSo, the key points here are her safety and her family's extreme views. She's in a dangerous situation where her life could be at risk if her parents found out. The boyfriend didn't realize the severity of her family's possible actions. She felt that keeping the baby would put both her and her boyfriend in danger, so she made the decision to have an abortion alone. \n\nNow, considering ethics and morality. In many places, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including abortion. However, the situation is complicated by the boyfriend's potential feelings and the cultural context. But the main issue here is her safety. She's facing life-threatening risks from her family if she doesn't terminate the pregnancy. \n\nHer boyfriend believed they could handle the situation, but she knew better because of her understanding of her family. She had to make a choice between her life and the baby's life. Since her life was in danger, her decision might be seen as necessary for self-preservation. \n\nOn the other hand, not informing her boyfriend could be seen as a breach of trust. But in a context where speaking up could lead to her death, maybe secrecy was the only option. The question is whether she is in the wrong for not telling him. But given her reasons, it's a matter of survival. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that she's not in the wrong (B), because her decision was made to protect her life and her boyfriend's safety, based on her knowledge of her family's extreme actions. The boyfriend's wish to keep the baby is understandable, but her situation was more dire. Her actions were a result of necessity and self-preservation.\n"
