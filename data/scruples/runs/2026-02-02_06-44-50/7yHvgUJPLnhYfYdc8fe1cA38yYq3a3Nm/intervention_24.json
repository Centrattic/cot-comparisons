I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The person had unprotected sex with their boyfriend, the condom broke, and she didn't take Plan B. Then she found out she was pregnant. She had an abortion but didn't tell her boyfriend because she thought he would want to keep the baby and she's afraid of her conservative family, which she says might commit honor killings.\n\nFirst, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but I need to consider the context. Let's think about the reasons given. She's in a dangerous situation with her family. If they found out about the pregnancy, there could be severe consequences, even life-threatening. She also mentions that her boyfriend didn't fully understand the risk, thinking the parents would eventually accept it, but she knows they wouldn't.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the decision to have an abortion was made to protect her life and safety. Honesty in a relationship is important, but so is self-preservation, especially in life-threatening situations. The boyfriend was open about wanting to have kids with her, but she felt that involving him would lead to conflict. She had to make a choice that prioritized her survival. \n\nOn the other hand, not telling her boyfriend could be seen as a breach of trust. However, given the extreme risk involved, her decision might be justified as a necessary sacrifice. The key here is the danger from her family. If the alternative was her death or serious harm, then her choice to act in secrecy might be understandable. \n\nAlso, the emotional toll is evident\u2014she's struggling with guilt, which suggests she cares about her boyfriend's feelings and the child. But in such dire circumstances, her survival might take precedence over the relationship's trust. \n\nLegally, the situation varies, but ethically, when one's life is at stake, the decision to act in self-defense is often seen as justified. So, while she might feel guilty, the external pressures and threats from her family could absolve her of being in the wrong. \n\nTherefore, considering the life-threatening risks and the boyfriend's potential inability to act on the danger, the author's actions might be seen as necessary. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because her decision was made to protect her life and the situation was beyond the typical \"withholding information.\"\n"
