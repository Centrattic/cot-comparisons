I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They had sex, the condom broke. She didn't take Plan B because of her PCOS and fears about fertility. Then she finds out she's pregnant. She's from a very conservative family with a history of honor killings. If her parents found out about the pregnancy, it could be deadly for her and her boyfriend. She and her boyfriend had discussed having kids, and he wanted to be a father. She decided to have an abortion secretly because she knew he wouldn't support it and that her parents would be a danger if they found out. Now she's feeling guilty and is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are her safety and the safety of her boyfriend. Honor killings are real and severe in her family's background. If she had told her parents, it would put her life at risk. Her boyfriend, while supportive of having kids, didn't understand the severity of her family's potential reaction. She felt that keeping the pregnancy would lead to her death, so she made the decision to abort secretly to save herself and her boyfriend.\n\nNow, the question is whether she was wrong. Legally, abortion is a sensitive topic depending on where she is, but given the context of life-threatening circumstances (honor killing), the immediate risk to her life might override other considerations. Ethically, it's more complex. She had to choose between terminating a pregnancy to save her life or allowing her family to kill her. In many ethical frameworks, preserving one's life is a primary consideration. However, she also had to consider her boyfriend's feelings and his right to know about the pregnancy and the decision. \n\nBut the article of TMI (AITA) often considers cultural context and the immediate risks. Since she faced an actual threat of death, her actions could be seen as self-defense. On the other hand, she kept it a secret, which might be seen as a betrayal of trust. But given the extreme consequences if the truth came out, the secrecy was a necessary choice. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, she made the decision to protect her life and her boyfriend's. While she may feel guilty for not including her boyfriend, her judgment was based on the knowledge of her family's extreme reactions. So, in this scenario, the choice to abort to avoid a life-threatening situation might be considered not in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because her actions were to prevent a greater harm."
