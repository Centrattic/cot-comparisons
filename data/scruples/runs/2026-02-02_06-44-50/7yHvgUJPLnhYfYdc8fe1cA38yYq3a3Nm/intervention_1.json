I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user wants to know if the author of the abortion story is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person had a broken condom, didn't take Plan B, got pregnant, and then decided to have an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The main reason given is the risk of an honor killing from her conservative family. She and her boyfriend had discussed being ready for a child, and he wanted to keep it. She felt she had to hide the pregnancy to avoid her family's violent reaction. Now she's feeling guilty about keeping it a secret and going through with the abortion.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to hear my take. I need to weigh the ethical aspects here. On one hand, she made a decision to protect herself from potential violence, which is a matter of self-preservation. On the other hand, she withheld important information from her partner, which could strain trust in the relationship. \n\nAbortion is a personal decision, but the secrecy is a key point. In the context of a relationship, partners often share such critical health and life decisions. However, her fear of her family's reaction is real and extreme. Honor-based violence is a serious issue, and her safety is a primary concern. \n\nThe boyfriend's perspective is that he would have supported keeping the child and believed her family wouldn't kill her. But she knows her family better and feels that risk is too high. Her decision to act alone might be seen as selfish, but it's also an act of self-defense. \n\nEthically, is it wrong to prioritize one's own safety over a partner's wishes? In this case, the potential consequences of not getting the abortion (death) are severe. The moral responsibility might lie more with the family's actions than the author's choice to protect herself. \n\nSo, considering the life-threatening context and the extreme circumstances, the author's actions are a matter of survival. While the secrecy is problematic, the underlying reason is a matter of life and death. Therefore, she might not be in the wrong, given the circumstances.\n"
