I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if they're at fault for having an abortion without telling their boyfriend. The context is that they had unprotected sex, a condom broke, and they got pregnant. They mention having PCOS, which makes getting pregnant difficult. They didn't take Plan B because of that. The pregnancy test was positive, and they were happy but terrified. The main reason they had the abortion is because of their conservative family background, where honor killings are common. They fear their parents would kill them and their boyfriend if they found out about the pregnancy. They tried to tell their boyfriend about their parents' potential reaction, but he didn't believe it would be that severe. They decided to get the abortion secretly because they knew he would want to keep the baby.\n\nNow, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Let me break this down. The key factors here are the cultural context, the threat to their life, and the decision made in secret.\n\nFirst, the author is in a situation where their life is at risk. Honor killings are a real and severe threat in some cultures. If the author's family discovers the pregnancy, it could lead to their death. That's a life-threatening situation. In such cases, self-preservation is a strong argument. The author might feel that the abortion was necessary to protect their own life and their boyfriend's.\n\nHowever, the decision was made without the boyfriend's knowledge. The boyfriend had expressed a desire to be a father and support the child. The author believed that if he knew, he wouldn't allow the abortion. This creates a conflict between the author's safety and the boyfriend's wishes. The author is choosing between their life and the boyfriend's expectations.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is the author morally wrong? It's a tough one. On one hand, keeping the baby could lead to murder. On the other hand, the boyfriend's autonomy and right to know about the pregnancy and the decision to abort could be considered. However, in this scenario, the boyfriend's autonomy is secondary to the author's survival. The author's life is directly at risk, which is a higher priority in ethical considerations.\n\nAdditionally, the author's mental state is a factor. They mention feeling disgusted with themselves, which indicates guilt. But their decision was made out of fear for their life, not necessarily malice or selfishness. The cultural pressure here is immense, and the author is in a position where they can't seek help from their family or even their partner because they don't understand the severity.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we consider the context of life-threatening danger, the answer might be no. However, if we consider the breach of trust with the boyfriend, there's a case for yes. But given that the author's survival was at stake, the primary wrongdoer is the family's culture and the threat they pose. The author acted to save their own life, which is a fundamental right. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to make sure I'm not missing any angles.\n\nWait, but some might argue that the author should have tried to find another way to keep the baby safe, like moving away or seeking help. However, in the context of an honor killing, those options might not be feasible. The author might not have access to resources to protect themselves from their family. So, the abortion was a necessary action to prevent murder.\n\nAnother angle is the legal aspect. If the abortion was legal in their location, then maybe there's no legal wrong. But the question is about being in the wrong morally or ethically. Given the circumstances, the author's actions were a matter of self-defense. Therefore, they are not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
