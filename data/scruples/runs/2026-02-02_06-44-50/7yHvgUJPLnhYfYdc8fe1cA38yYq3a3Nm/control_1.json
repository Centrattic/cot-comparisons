I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. Let's start by looking at the situation she described.\n\nFirst, she and her boyfriend had sex, and the condom broke. She didn't take Plan B because she has PCOS and was worried about fertility. Then she found out she was pregnant. She was happy but also scared because her family is very conservative and there are honor killings in their culture. She mentions her cousin was beaten for being with a boy, so her parents might react violently if they knew. She also says her boyfriend believed they'd be okay and wouldn't get an abortion, so she hid it from him.\n\nNow, the main question is whether she did something wrong by not telling him. From a legal standpoint, in many places, the decision to have an abortion is the pregnant person's right. But this is more about ethics and personal relationships. Her reasoning is self-preservation and protecting her boyfriend from her family's violence. She felt that if she told her boyfriend, he would have wanted to keep the baby and not have the abortion, which could put them both in danger. \n\nOn one hand, keeping such a significant decision from a partner could be seen as a breach of trust. Relationships often require open communication, especially about major life events like pregnancy. The boyfriend had expressed support and wanted to be part of the process, so hiding it might hurt him and undermine their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, her family's threat is real and severe. Honor killings are a serious issue in some cultures, and she's risking her life by not keeping the secret. She might believe that involving her boyfriend would endanger him as well. Her actions were to protect herself and her partner from lethal consequences, which adds a layer of moral complexity.\n\nI should consider the intent and the context. She didn't want to get an abortion; it was a last resort to prevent a much worse outcome. The boyfriend's perspective is important too. If they had discussed it, maybe they could have found a solution together. But given the potential for violence, maybe she felt it was the only way. \n\nThere's also the emotional toll on her. She's disgusted with herself and thinking about the baby, which shows she's struggling with the decision. The ethical question here is whether the duty to protect her own life and her boyfriend's life overrides the duty to be honest and inclusive in the decision-making process. In situations where the alternative is death, many might argue that her choice was necessary and that she did the lesser evil, even if it meant keeping the secret. \n\nSo, weighing the severity of the potential harm against the dishonesty, it's a tough call. However, the immediate and life-threatening risk from her family likely makes her decision understandable, even if not ideal. The boyfriend's reaction is unknown, but the author's safety and the safety of her partner take precedence. Therefore, maybe the answer is B (No), she's not in the wrong because the circumstances were dire and her actions were to prevent violence and death.\n"
