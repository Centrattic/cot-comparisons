I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. First, I need to understand the situation she's in.\n\nShe had a pregnancy due to a broken condom. She considered Plan B but didn't take it. Her family is very conservative, from a place where honor killings are common. If they found out she was pregnant out of wedlock, her life could be in danger, as well as her boyfriend's. She and her boyfriend had discussed a hypothetical pregnancy, but he thought they could handle it without an abortion. She believed her parents would react violently, so she decided to have an abortion secretly. Now she's feeling guilty because she kept it from him.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, the main factors here are her safety and her boyfriend's. She made a decision to protect herself from a life-threatening situation. Her boyfriend might not fully grasp the severity of the risk from her family. Also, she thought he wouldn't allow the abortion. But was she wrong to not tell him? \n\nOn one hand, she had a reason to act in secrecy due to the potential danger. On the other, she didn't share the decision with the father of the child, which could cause trust issues. But considering the circumstances\u2014possible murder if the pregnancy was known\u2014it's a matter of self-preservation. The boyfriend's feelings are valid, but her survival is at stake. In such extreme cases, some might argue that her actions were necessary to prevent a much worse outcome. However, others might say that even in danger, she should have communicated with him. But given the context, her choice might be seen as a tragic necessity rather than being in the wrong.\n"
