I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves an abortion decision made without the boyfriend's knowledge due to a conservative family background that could lead to an honor killing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author had unprotected sex, a condom broke, became pregnant, and decided to have an abortion secretly. The reasons given are the potential for honor-based violence from her family, who are from a country where honor killings are common. She also mentions her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the baby and support them, but she believed he didn't understand the severity of her family's reaction.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The central issue here is the decision to have an abortion without her partner's knowledge. On one hand, she's in a dangerous situation where her life and safety are at risk. On the other hand, keeping such a significant decision from her partner could be seen as a breach of trust, especially since it's their child.\n\nBut the context is crucial. The author is facing life-threatening circumstances if her family found out. Her reasoning is that she had to protect herself and possibly her partner from her family's violence. In such extreme cases, some might argue that her actions were necessary for self-preservation. However, others might say that she should have found a way to communicate with her boyfriend, even if he didn't understand the risks, because withholding such a big decision could lead to betrayal and hurt.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the intent behind the action matters. Her intent was to prevent a much worse outcome (her death or serious harm). However, the method (keeping it secret) might be ethically questionable. There's a balance between self-preservation and partner autonomy. But given the extreme danger she's in, her choice might be seen as justified despite the lack of communication.\n\nThe boyfriend's perspective is also important. He expected to be part of the decision-making process, believing he would support her. But he didn't grasp the real danger, which she knows all too well. This is a situation where her lived experience and knowledge of her family's potential actions might make her decision the only viable option.\n\nIn terms of morality, it's a gray area. But considering the life-threatening context, some might argue that she's not in the wrong because her actions were to prevent her own murder. Others might say that she should have found a way to inform him, even if he didn't understand, to maintain transparency in the relationship.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). Given the circumstances, the answer might lean towards B (No) because the decision was made to prevent a severe, life-threatening situation. However, there's a valid argument that secrecy is wrong regardless of the reasons. But given the extreme danger, the necessity of the action might outweigh the obligation to inform her partner.\n"
