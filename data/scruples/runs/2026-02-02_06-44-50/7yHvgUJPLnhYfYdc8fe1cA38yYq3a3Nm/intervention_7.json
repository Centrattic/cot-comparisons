I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. The person got pregnant, had an abortion without telling their boyfriend, and the main reason was to avoid an honor killing from their family. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the boyfriend's perspective. He said he would support them if they had a child, even go as far as getting a job and an apartment. The author thought he wouldn't understand the severity of her family's reaction, so she kept it a secret. But the boyfriend wanted to be a father and was in favor of keeping the baby. So by not telling him, she deprived him of the chance to be part of that decision.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is about self-preservation. Her family's background is dangerous. Honor killings are a real threat, and the author believes that her life and her boyfriend's could be in danger if the pregnancy was known. That's a serious life-threatening situation. In such cases, the priority is often self-defense and safety. \n\nHowever, the moral dilemma here is about the secrecy. She involved herself in a decision that affects another person (the boyfriend) without his knowledge. The boyfriend's right to know about the pregnancy and the child is a factor. But the author's life and safety are also at stake. In legal terms, in some places, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including abortion, even if it's without the partner's consent. \n\nThe emotional aspect is heavy too. The author feels guilty for not telling her boyfriend because she knew he would want the child. But she also believes that her family's threat is real and immediate. It's a situation where two important values are conflicting: individual autonomy and the right to life versus the partner's rights and the potential for violence from her family.\n\nIn terms of ethics, different frameworks might weigh these differently. A utilitarian approach might look at the consequences: if not having the abortion would lead to her death or her boyfriend's, then the abortion was necessary. Deontological ethics might stress the importance of honesty and respecting others' rights. But in this case, the boyfriend's right to know is being weighed against the author's right to life. \n\nLegally, in many countries, a woman can have an abortion without her partner's consent. So from a legal standpoint, she might not be in the wrong. But morally, the secrecy could be seen as a breach of trust. However, given the life-threatening context, the secrecy is a protective measure.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author made a difficult decision under extreme pressure to protect her life and her boyfriend's safety. While the decision involved not being honest with her partner, the circumstances of potential violence and death are significant. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, given the severity of the threat she faced.\n"
