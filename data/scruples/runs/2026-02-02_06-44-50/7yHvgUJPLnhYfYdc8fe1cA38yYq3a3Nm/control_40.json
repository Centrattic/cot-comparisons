I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let's start by understanding the key points of her story.\n\nFirst, she and her boyfriend had sex, the condom broke, she didn't take Plan B because of her PCOS and concerns about fertility. She got pregnant and took a medical abortion at nine weeks. She didn't tell her boyfriend because he would have wanted to keep the baby, and she believed her conservative family would kill her for getting pregnant out of wedlock, even to the point of honor killings. Her family's reaction is a significant threat to her life and her boyfriend's. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong for having the abortion without telling her boyfriend. Let's break it down. \n\nOn one hand, she made a life-saving decision for herself to avoid a horrific fate. The threat from her family is real and severe. She also mentions that her boyfriend wouldn't have supported the abortion, so she kept it secret to protect him from her family's retaliation. Her motivation was to save her life and his, which seems like a valid reason. \n\nOn the other hand, she didn't inform her boyfriend, who expressed a desire to be a father and support her. He might have felt betrayed or not involved in a major decision. But given the high stakes\u2014her possible murder\u2014she might have made a choice to prioritize her survival over his right to know. \n\nLegally and ethically, the decision to have an abortion is often a personal one, especially in cases of severe risk. However, relationships require trust and communication. But when there's an immediate threat to life, the ethical choice might lean towards self-preservation, even if it means breaking that trust. \n\nAnother angle is her responsibility to her boyfriend. If she went through with the pregnancy, he might have faced danger from her family as well. She considered that her parents would hurt him too. So by having the abortion, she protected both herself and him. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. If the \"wrong\" is about moral or ethical responsibility to her partner versus her own safety, it's a tough call. In some contexts, withholding such a significant decision from a partner could be seen as a breach of trust. However, when the alternative is death, the moral calculus changes. \n\nAlso, her emotional struggle is clear\u2014she feels disgusted with herself, which suggests she sees some wrongdoing, but that's her internal conflict, not necessarily an objective judgment. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, self-preservation is a fundamental right. If her life was at imminent risk, her decision to act to save herself could be justified. The boyfriend's reaction is a secondary consideration here, especially if he couldn't comprehend the severity of the threat. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were driven by a desire to survive in a dangerous situation. While she kept the decision secret, the context of life-threatening circumstances might mitigate the ethical blame. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
