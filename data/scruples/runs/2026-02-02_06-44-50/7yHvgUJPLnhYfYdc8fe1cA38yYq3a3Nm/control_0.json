I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is pretty complex. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author got pregnant after a condom broke. She didn't use Plan B because of her PCOS and past medical advice. Then she found out she was pregnant. She was excited but also scared because of her conservative family background with a history of honor killings. Her parents would be extremely upset, and there's a real danger of violence against her and her boyfriend if they found out. She and her boyfriend had discussed being a parent, and he wanted to keep the baby. However, she believed he wouldn't understand the severity of the danger from her family. So she decided to have an abortion secretly.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer depends on various factors. Legally, abortion laws vary, but since she did it medically and got it done, maybe that's not the issue here. Ethically, it's tricky. She had a valid reason to fear for her life and her boyfriend's. Her decision was to protect herself from potentially fatal consequences. However, she didn't tell her boyfriend, which could be a problem in their relationship. He might feel betrayed, especially since he wanted to be a parent. But her reasoning was that if she told him, he might not take the danger seriously and she couldn't risk that.\n\nOn one hand, making a major decision like an abortion without the partner's knowledge could be seen as wrong, especially if it goes against their wishes. On the other hand, the author's life was in serious danger. The risk of honor-based violence is real and extreme. Her choice was to prioritize her safety and survival, which many people would argue is the right decision under such circumstances. Also, she felt conflicted and guilty, which adds to the emotional complexity.\n\nIt's important to consider the context of her family's extreme views and the specific risks she faces. In such a dangerous situation, her decision to act to protect herself might outweigh the ethical obligation to inform her boyfriend. However, the lack of communication could lead to issues in the relationship, but given the life-threatening scenario, it's a difficult call. Ultimately, the author was trying to survive and avoid a horrific outcome, which is a strong justification for her actions.\n"
