I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. Let me start by understanding the situation. She and her boyfriend had sex, the condom broke, and she became pregnant. She didn't take Plan B because of her PCOS, but she's worried about her conservative family where honor killings happen. She didn't want to get her parents involved because they might take her back to her home country and kill her. She also mentioned that her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the baby, even though she knew her parents would be a threat. She felt conflicted but decided to have an abortion secretly.\n\nFirst, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks she's in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the context. The key points here are the potential danger from her family, her boyfriend's wishes, and the emotional impact on her.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might argue that keeping the pregnancy a secret and not involving her boyfriend could be wrong because he had a right to know and be part of the decision. However, her decision was made out of fear for her life and her boyfriend's safety. The risk of honor killing is a severe threat. In such contexts, self-preservation is a strong argument. She also tried to convince her boyfriend that the parents wouldn't react that way, but she knew better. Her knowledge of her family's extreme actions means she prioritized her safety over her boyfriend's wishes.\n\nIn terms of relationships, trust is important. Hiding something as significant as a pregnancy and abortion might lead to future issues. But the situation is extreme. If she had told him, and he insisted on keeping the baby, her parents might have found out, leading to fatal consequences. The decision was made to protect both herself and her boyfriend, even if it meant a betrayal of trust. The ethical dilemma here is between her right to bodily autonomy and the safety from her family versus her partner's right to know. However, given the life-threatening circumstances, many would argue that her survival is the most critical factor. So, while she may have made a difficult choice that wasn't ideal in a trusting relationship, her immediate need to protect herself and her boyfriend from violence might outweigh the breach of trust. Therefore, the answer might be B (she's not in the wrong) because the decision was made under extreme pressure to avoid serious harm.\n"
