I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the provided situation. The story is about a woman who had an abortion without telling her boyfriend because of the risk of an honor killing from her conservative family. She mentions her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the baby, but she felt it was necessary to protect herself and him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects. Abortion is a sensitive topic with varying views. The author's decision was influenced by life-threatening family circumstances. Honor killings are a serious issue, and in her context, keeping the child could lead to her murder and her boyfriend's harm. This adds a layer of self-preservation and protection of her partner.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, depending on where she is, abortion might be legal, but the situation's specifics aren't given. However, the main issue here isn't legality but moral responsibility. The author felt she had no choice due to her family's extreme views. She also thought her boyfriend wouldn't support her decision if he knew, so she acted unilaterally to prevent both her death and his potential harm.\n\nHer boyfriend believed they would handle it together, which is understandable. But the author's perspective is that she had to act alone because her life was at stake. The key here is the risk of immediate, severe harm versus the moral dilemma of the abortion. In such cases, people often prioritize survival when faced with extreme threats.\n\nThe user is asking for a judgment on whether the author is in the wrong. Considering the life-threatening circumstances and the lack of viable alternatives, many would argue she wasn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's wishes are important, but the immediate danger from her family overrides that in this scenario. The author's actions were to prevent her death and her boyfriend's harm, which are serious consequences.\n\nHowever, some might argue that she should have found a way to involve her boyfriend or seek help. But given her family's history and the severity of the punishment, that might not have been safe. The decision was made in a high-stress, life-threatening situation. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision was made to protect herself and her partner from imminent danger, which is a compelling reason. Therefore, the answer is B (she is not in the wrong).\n"
