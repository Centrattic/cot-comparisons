I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she had an abortion without telling her boyfriend, mainly because of her conservative family background. They come from a place where honor killings are common, and her parents would kill her if they found out she had sex before marriage and got pregnant. She also thought her boyfriend wouldn't support the abortion because he wanted kids. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects. In some contexts, abortion is a personal choice, but there's also the aspect of not involving the partner. However, her reasons are life-threatening to both her and her boyfriend. If she had told him, he might have insisted on keeping the baby, which would lead to her family finding out and possibly killing her. That's a serious risk of death or harm. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend had a right to know since it's his child. But given the context of her family's extreme reaction, maybe she had a valid reason to keep it secret. The question is whether her decision to hide the pregnancy and abortion was wrong. \n\nLegally, in many places, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including abortion. Ethically, the situation is more complex. She prioritized her safety and his safety over her partner's wishes, which could be seen as justified given the life-threatening circumstances. \n\nBut some might argue that she should have found a way to involve her boyfriend, even if it was risky. However, considering the potential consequences, her choice might be understandable. The key factors here are the immediate danger to her life and her family's violent tendencies. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the decision to act secretly was necessary to prevent a greater harm. Since her life and her boyfriend's safety were at stake, and she couldn't rely on her boyfriend's understanding of the danger, it seems like she was trying to prevent a much worse outcome. Therefore, she's probably not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
