I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. So, the person had an abortion without telling their boyfriend. They had sex, the condom broke, and they got pregnant. The main reason they had the abortion was to avoid being part of an honor killing by their conservative family, who might kill them for being pregnant before marriage. The boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, but the author felt it was necessary to have the abortion to protect both of them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, having an abortion is a legal right, especially in early pregnancy. The author's decision was based on their family's extreme reaction, which could be fatal. So, from a safety standpoint, avoiding a life-threatening situation is a strong reason. Also, the author mentions that their boyfriend didn't fully understand the severity of their family's potential reaction. The author might have thought that keeping the baby would put both their lives at risk.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend wanted to be a parent and was supportive. The author chose not to involve him because they believed he wouldn't support the abortion. But withholding such a major decision from a partner could be seen as a breach of trust. However, the author's reasoning was to protect the boyfriend from their family's violent reaction, which they think the boyfriend underestimates.\n\nEthically, it's a tough call. The author's life and safety are in danger, which is a critical factor. In situations where someone's life is at risk due to cultural or familial pressures, self-preservation is a valid reason. The author might not be in the wrong because they prioritized their survival, which is a basic human right. However, the decision to not inform the boyfriend could be seen as wrong because it involved a partner's potential parental rights and their right to be part of the decision-making process.\n\nBut considering the context of honor killings and the author's knowledge of their family's history, it's a matter of life or death versus a relationship issue. In such extreme circumstances, many would argue that the author's decision was necessary to prevent harm. The boyfriend, while wanting to be a father, might not have fully grasped the immediate danger, so the author took a calculated risk to protect both themselves and the boyfriend.\n\nSo, balancing the immediate threat to life against the relationship aspect, the author's actions seem to be a necessary evil given the circumstances. Therefore, they might not be in the wrong.\n"
