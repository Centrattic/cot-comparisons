I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author getting an abortion without telling her boyfriend because she's from a conservative family that might commit an honor killing if they found out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects here. The author mentions that her family is extremely conservative and that there have been instances of honor killings. She also says her cousin was beaten for dating a boy. Her parents think she's a virgin, so if they found out she was pregnant, it would be a death sentence. She got a medical abortion at nine weeks to avoid that. The boyfriend wanted to keep the baby and support her, but she didn't want him to be involved because he wouldn't agree to the abortion. She's feeling guilty and conflicted.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, this is a complex issue. On one hand, the decision to have an abortion was made without the boyfriend's knowledge, which might be seen as a breach of trust. On the other hand, the author was in a dangerous situation where her life and the life of the boyfriend could be at risk. She's protecting herself from severe harm, which is a significant factor. Also, she's dealing with the guilt and is reflecting on her actions, showing that she's torn between her feelings and the necessity of the situation.\n\nIn many cases, the right to make decisions about one's own body is a key point. However, the context here includes a high risk of violence and even murder if the pregnancy were known. The boyfriend might not have understood the severity of the parents' reaction, as he thought they'd eventually accept it. The author knows her family better, so her decision is based on a realistic assessment of danger.\n\nThere's also the aspect of autonomy. The author felt she had no other choice but to act alone to prevent a tragic outcome. While withholding information can be problematic, the potential consequences of disclosure here are extreme. The boyfriend might not have been able to support her decision to terminate the pregnancy, leading to conflict that could jeopardize their safety.\n\nSo, considering the author's intent to protect herself and her boyfriend from lethal violence, and the fact that she made the decision in a high-stress, life-threatening context, it's more about survival than being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), as she's not in the wrong given the circumstances.\n"
