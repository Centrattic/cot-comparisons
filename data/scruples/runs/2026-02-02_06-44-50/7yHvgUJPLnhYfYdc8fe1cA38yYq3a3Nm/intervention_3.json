I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple had unprotected sex, leading to a pregnancy. The author didn't take Plan B because of PCOS and was more worried about STDs. She then took a pregnancy test and decided to have an abortion. The key reasons are her conservative family's potential violent reaction (honour killings) and her belief that her boyfriend wouldn't understand or would prevent her from getting the abortion. She felt terrified and conflicted but decided to act alone.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, keeping such a significant decision from a partner might seem like a betrayal. The boyfriend had expressed support for raising a child, so he might have been upset, but the author's fear of her family's reaction is real and severe. On the other hand, the author's life and safety are at risk. In many ethical frameworks, self-preservation is a priority. Also, the boyfriend might not have been aware of the severity of the threat, leading to the author's decision to protect both herself and him by not revealing the truth.\n\nIn terms of legal and moral considerations, the author's actions were to prevent a potential murder. While the decision to have an abortion is personal and ethically complex, the secrecy was driven by external, life-threatening pressures. The boyfriend's right to know is important, but the author's survival and safety are paramount. So, is she in the wrong? It's a tough call. In some contexts, withholding such information could be seen as dishonest. However, given the extreme circumstances and the risk of death, her decision to act alone might be justified. The answer depends on weighing the moral duty to inform a partner against the necessity to protect oneself from lethal harm. I'm leaning towards B, not in the wrong, because her actions were to prevent a much worse outcome.\n"
