I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about her having an abortion without her boyfriend's knowledge. She mentions her conservative family and the risk of honor killings. Her boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, but she felt that revealing the pregnancy would lead to her being killed and her family hurting the boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author made a decision based on her belief that her life and her boyfriend's safety were at risk. She didn't tell him because she knew he would want to keep the baby and wouldn't understand the danger from her family. On the other hand, she kept a major life decision from him, which could be seen as a betrayal of trust.\n\nBut then, the alternative was potentially life-threatening. In many places, the right to make decisions about one's own body is considered a fundamental right. However, this is complicated by the relationship dynamics. The boyfriend had a right to know if he was going to become a father, but the author had a right to privacy, especially if her life was in danger.\n\nAlso, the cultural context is important. The author's family's extreme views and the threat of honor killings add a layer of danger that might not be understood by the boyfriend. Her decision to protect herself and her partner from her family's violence is a heavy consideration.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a tough call. She violated trust but acted to save her life. The boyfriend might feel wronged because he wasn't part of the decision. But in a life-threatening situation, her actions could be seen as necessary. The question is whether the secrecy was justified. Given the potential for lethal consequences, it's possible that she wasn't in the wrong. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because her decision was made under extreme threat and to protect both herself and her partner.\n"
