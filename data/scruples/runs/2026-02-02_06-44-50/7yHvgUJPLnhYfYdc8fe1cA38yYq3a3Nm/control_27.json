I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who had an abortion without telling her boyfriend is in the wrong. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the user is from a conservative family where honor killings are common. She was worried that if her parents found out about the pregnancy, they would kill her and possibly harm her boyfriend. Her cousin was beaten for being with a boy, so there's a real fear here. She didn't want to risk her life or her boyfriend's life.\n\nShe and her boyfriend had discussed what they'd do if she got pregnant. He wanted to keep the baby, but she knew he didn't understand the severity of her family's reaction. She decided to have an abortion secretly to protect herself and her boyfriend. Now she feels guilty and wonders if she did the wrong thing.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, from a moral standpoint, she made a choice to protect her safety. Her life was at risk. The boyfriend wanted to keep the child, but she knew that revealing the pregnancy would lead to fatal consequences. She had to choose between her life and the pregnancy. In such extreme circumstances, many would argue that self-preservation is justified. However, keeping it from her boyfriend could be a point of contention. But given the threat to her life, maybe that's understandable too.\n\nLegally, depending on where she is, abortion laws vary. Assuming it's legal, she's not breaking the law. But ethically, it's about her survival versus the fetus. The question is whether the wrong she did (not informing her partner) outweighs the necessity of saving her life. Since the partner didn't realize the danger, she had to act alone. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong. Her actions were a necessary evil to protect herself from imminent harm.\n"
