I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves an abortion done secretly by the author because of the risk of honor violence from her conservative family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author had unprotected sex when the condom broke. She didn't take Plan B due to her PCOS and fertility issues. She got pregnant and decided to have an abortion without her boyfriend's knowledge. Her reasoning is that her family would kill her if they found out, given their history of honor-based violence. The boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, but the author felt she couldn't risk her life and her parents discovering the truth.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The user wants a simple A or B answer. To decide, I should consider the ethical and legal aspects, as well as the context. In many places, abortion is legal, so legally she's probably okay. Ethically, it's more complex. The author made a choice to protect her life from a severe threat. Her boyfriend had a different view, but she believed she couldn't allow the pregnancy to continue due to the extreme danger.\n\nThe community reaction to such stories often considers the intent and the circumstances. Here, the author was in immediate danger. Honesty is important in relationships, but so is self-preservation. The boyfriend might feel betrayed, but her decision was based on survival. Given the severity of the potential consequences (her life), it's likely that the community would side with her. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
