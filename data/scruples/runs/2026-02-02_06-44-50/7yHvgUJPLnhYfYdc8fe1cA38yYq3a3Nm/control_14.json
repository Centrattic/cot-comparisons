I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting an abortion without telling her boyfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple had sex with a broken condom. The author didn't use Plan B because of her PCOS. She got pregnant. She comes from a very conservative family where honor killings happen. She's worried if her family found out, they'd kill her and possibly her boyfriend. She and her boyfriend had talked about if she got pregnant; he wanted to keep the baby, but she knew her parents would react violently. So, she decided to have an abortion secretly because she felt it was necessary to save her life and his.\n\nNow, the question is if she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the context. The author's decision was based on self-preservation and protecting her boyfriend. She believed that if her family found out, it would lead to her death. Her boyfriend was in favor of keeping the child, so she withheld the pregnancy to prevent him from trying to stop her from getting the abortion. \n\nLegally, in many places, abortion is a personal choice, especially in early stages. Ethically, it's a complex issue. The author's actions were to avoid severe harm. She wasn't acting out of selfishness but out of fear for her life and safety. The boyfriend might feel betrayed, but her priority was survival. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, she had to make a life-or-death decision under high pressure. The fact that her family's culture condones honor killings adds a layer of danger. She didn't want to put her boyfriend in harm's way either. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's actions were a personal choice made under extreme circumstances to protect herself and her partner. Therefore, she isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
