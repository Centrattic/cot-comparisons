I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about her getting an abortion without telling her boyfriend. First, I need to look at the reasons she provided. \n\nShe had an accident with the condom, didn't take Plan B, and ended up pregnant. Her main concern was her conservative family's reaction, which she claims could lead to an honor killing. She mentions her cousin's experience, so she's genuinely scared. She also says she and her boyfriend had talked about pregnancy before, but he wanted to keep the baby, while she knew her parents would never accept it. She decided to have the abortion secretly because she believed her boyfriend wouldn't support it, and her life would be in danger.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, she didn't inform her boyfriend, which could be seen as a breach of trust. But on the other hand, she was in a life-threatening situation due to her family's extreme views. She had to make a choice to protect herself and possibly her boyfriend from harm. \n\nIn many places, the right to make decisions about one's own body is considered a personal choice. However, in a relationship, transparency is usually important. But given the extreme risks involved, her decision to act alone might be justified. Also, her boyfriend's perspective might not fully grasp the danger from her family, so she might have thought she was protecting him by not involving him.\n\nThe key factors here are the immediate danger to her life and the legal/ethical right to terminate a pregnancy. If her actions were to prevent a serious threat to her safety, that could override the expectation of shared decision-making in a relationship. However, the emotional impact on the boyfriend and the potential for betrayal might also be a consideration. But given the context of potential honor killing, which is a severe and real threat, her decision might be seen as necessary for survival.\n\nSo, considering the extreme circumstances and the risk of her life, I think she's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
