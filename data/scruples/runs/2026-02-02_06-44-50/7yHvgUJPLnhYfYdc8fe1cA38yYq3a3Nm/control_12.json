I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: They had unprotected sex because a condom broke. The woman has PCOS and was told it might be hard to get pregnant, so maybe she didn't expect to get pregnant. When she did, she was conflicted but decided to have an abortion. The main reason she gives is her extremely conservative family background, where an out-of-wedlock pregnancy could lead to honor killings. She mentions her cousin was beaten for dating someone, so she fears for her life and her boyfriend's if her parents found out. She also says her boyfriend wanted to keep the baby and wouldn't understand her parents' reaction, so she hid the pregnancy and abortion from him.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). To decide, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects here.\n\nFrom her perspective, she made a choice to protect herself and her boyfriend from life-threatening consequences. Her reasoning is that her family would kill her if they knew about the pregnancy. The boyfriend would have wanted to keep the baby, but she knew he wouldn't understand the severity of her family's reaction. She feels guilty but believes the abortion was necessary for her safety.\n\nOn the other hand, not informing her boyfriend could be seen as a breach of trust. The boyfriend had expressed a desire to be a father and support her, so being kept in the dark might be hurtful. However, the woman's life is at stake, which complicates things.\n\nLegally, the morality of abortion varies by location, but the key here is the danger she faces. If her life is in danger, then self-preservation might justify her actions. The boyfriend's right to know versus her right to self-defense against her family's threats. The woman's autonomy in making decisions about her body is another factor. Even though the baby might be a \"shared\" child, in a situation where her life is threatened, her survival might take precedence.\n\nThe story emphasizes the extreme danger she's in. Honor killings are real in some cultures, and the risk here is severe. The woman's decision to act secretly might be seen as necessary to prevent a much worse outcome. The boyfriend's feelings are valid, but if he didn't fully grasp the danger, she might have felt it was the only option.\n\nTherefore, considering the life-threatening circumstances, the author is not in the wrong. Her decision was made to save her life and her partner's life, despite the emotional complications. So the answer is B.\n"
