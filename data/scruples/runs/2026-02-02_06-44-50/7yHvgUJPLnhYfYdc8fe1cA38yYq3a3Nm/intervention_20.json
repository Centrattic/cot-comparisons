I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user wants to know if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me try to work through this.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is in a relationship, had unprotected sex because the condom broke, got pregnant. They had an abortion without telling their boyfriend. Their reasoning is that their conservative family might commit an honor killing if they found out about the pregnancy, and the boyfriend wouldn't have supported the abortion. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the author had an abortion secretly. Trust is a big part of relationships, and keeping such a major decision from a partner could be seen as a betrayal. The boyfriend was supportive of having kids and thought they'd be there for the author. The author's decision to not involve them might be viewed as not respecting their input or partnership.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's family is extremely conservative, with a history of violence, including honor killings. The author is risking their life and their boyfriend's by not revealing the pregnancy. They might feel that involving their boyfriend would put both of them in danger, as he wouldn't understand the severity of the situation. The author's choice was made to protect themselves and their partner from lethal consequences. \n\nAdditionally, the author had PCOS and was told having kids without treatment would be hard, so the pregnancy might have been a significant emotional event. The decision to abort was made under immense pressure and fear for their safety. The post also shows the author is struggling with guilt, which adds to the complexity.\n\nI should consider cultural context and the immediate dangers the author is facing. In many places, medical decisions are a person's right, and in cases of life-threatening family situations, self-preservation is a priority. However, the secrecy aspect could be a problem in the relationship if the boyfriend later finds out. But given the context of potential violence, the author might have had no viable option. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the answer is A, it would mean the secrecy is a dealbreaker, but if B, the author's safety and survival take precedence. Since the author was protecting themselves and their boyfriend from a dangerous family environment, and their partner wouldn't have supported the abortion, it's a situation where the author's decision was driven by fear of imminent harm. \n\nIn such extreme cases, some might argue that the author's actions were necessary for survival, making them not the asshole. Others might focus on the lack of communication. But considering the life-threatening context, the answer might lean towards B, not in the wrong.\n"
