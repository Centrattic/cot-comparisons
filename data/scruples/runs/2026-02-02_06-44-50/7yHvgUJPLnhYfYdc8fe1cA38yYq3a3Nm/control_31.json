I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves an abortion done secretly from the boyfriend due to fears of honor killing by her conservative family. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had a broken condom, didn't use Plan B, got pregnant. She decided to have an abortion without telling her boyfriend because he wanted the baby and she believes her family would kill her if they found out. She's now feeling guilty.\n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLegally, in many places, abortion is a woman's right, though it varies by region. Ethically, it's a complex issue. The author felt her life was in danger. She believed her family would commit an honor killing, which is a real issue in some cultures. She also thought her boyfriend wouldn't support the abortion, so she kept it secret to prevent conflict.\n\nArguments for her not being in the wrong (B): She made a choice to protect her life, which is a fundamental right. The boyfriend's wishes don't override her safety. The law in some places allows abortion when the mother's life is at risk, even if it's done without the partner's knowledge.\n\nArguments for her being in the wrong (A): Withholding such a significant decision from a partner could be seen as a breach of trust. However, given the life-threatening context, this might be justified. There's also the aspect of her not considering other options, but the scenario suggests she felt no other choice.\n\nCultural context is important here. Honor killings are real threats, and her decision was based on survival. The boyfriend might not have understood the severity of the situation, but that's his lack of awareness, not her fault.\n\nSo, considering the life-threatening situation and the right to make decisions about one's own body, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The secrecy was a necessary action to prevent her own death, which is a stronger consideration than the boyfriend's opposition.\n"
