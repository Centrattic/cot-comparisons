I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. Let me start by reading through her story again.\n\nShe and her boyfriend had sex in December, the condom broke. She didn't use Plan B because she has PCOS and was told it's hard to get pregnant without treatment. She was worried about STDs instead. Then she found out she was pregnant, felt happy but terrified. Her family is very conservative, from a place where honor killings happen. She's not allowed to date before marriage. Her cousin was beaten by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy. She's afraid her parents would kill her and hurt her boyfriend if they found out. She's also told that if her boyfriend knew, he wouldn't let her get the abortion and would have been excited to be a father. So she decided to have the abortion secretly at nine weeks and now feels guilty.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Let me break this down. First, the legal aspect. In some places, abortion is legal, especially in early stages. If she had a medical abortion in a hospital, it's probably legal. But the story doesn't specify the location, but the fact that she could go to the hospital suggests it's possible. \n\nThen the ethical part. She had a baby's health in mind, but also her safety. Her parents are a risk for honor killings, which is a real and severe danger. She mentions that her cousin was beaten, so this is not just her fear but a family pattern. If she had told her boyfriend, he would have wanted to keep the baby, and she would have been in danger. So she made a choice to protect herself from life-threatening harm. \n\nAlso, she had a medical condition (PCOS) that makes pregnancy difficult. But she still got pregnant, so maybe that's why she was excited. However, she felt that the risk from her family outweighed her desire to keep the baby. \n\nThe boyfriend's perspective is that he would have supported her and not let her get the abortion. So she kept it secret to avoid his interference. But does that mean she was wrong? She thought she was protecting both herself and the baby. If she had told him, he might have tried to keep her from her family, which could have been dangerous. \n\nHonor killings are a serious issue, and the author is in immediate danger. Her decision was made to prevent potential death or severe harm. In many ethics discussions, self-preservation is a valid reason. Also, the fact that she felt guilty afterward suggests she cares about her boyfriend and the baby. \n\nBut some might argue that she should have told her boyfriend, as it's his child too. However, given the context of the family's violent history, maybe that's not feasible. She might not have had a safe option if she told him. \n\nSo considering her circumstances: life-threatening danger from her family, legal access to abortion, and the boyfriend's likely opposition. Her decision seems to be made under duress and to save her life. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
