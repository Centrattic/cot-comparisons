I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple had sex with a broken condom. The author didn't take Plan B because of her PCOS and a history of being told it's hard for her to get pregnant. She was worried about STDs at first. Then she got a positive pregnancy test and felt conflicted. She's from a conservative family where honor killings are common, and her parents wouldn't accept her having a child outside of marriage. She mentions her cousin being beaten for dating, and she's scared they'd kill her if they found out. She also says her boyfriend would have supported the pregnancy and not allowed her to have an abortion. She did it secretly because she believed he wouldn't understand the severity of the situation.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, in the U.S., having an abortion is a legal right, and the decision is typically up to the pregnant individual. But the ethical side is more complex. The author made a choice based on her personal safety and family context. She had valid reasons, including the risk of her life and her parents' extreme reaction. However, she didn't share this with her boyfriend, which is the main point of contention here. The boyfriend wanted to be involved and support her, but she felt it was necessary to keep it a secret to protect both herself and him. \n\nNow, the question is whether the secrecy makes her wrong. In relationships, honesty is usually valued. But in this case, the author is in a dangerous situation. If she told her boyfriend, he might have tried to protect her by not letting her have the abortion, which could have led to her parents finding out. The author's decision was based on life-threatening risks. \n\nOn one hand, withholding such a significant decision from her partner could be seen as a breach of trust. But on the other hand, she was trying to prevent a worse outcome\u2014her own death or harm to her boyfriend. The boyfriend's reaction, while wanting to support her, might not have considered the actual danger she's facing. The author knows her family's mindset better than he does, so her choice to act alone could be seen as necessary for her survival.\n\nI think the key here is the context of the potential harm if the secret was revealed. In life-or-death situations, the decision to protect oneself might override the usual expectation of full transparency. So the answer would likely be B (No), because she acted to save her life and avoid extreme violence, and the secrecy was a protective measure, not necessarily a moral failing.\n"
