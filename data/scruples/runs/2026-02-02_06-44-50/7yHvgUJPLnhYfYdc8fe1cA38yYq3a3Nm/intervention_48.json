I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is complicated.\n\nFirst, the author got pregnant when the condom broke. She didn't use Plan B because of her PCOS condition. She was worried about having a child but also about her conservative family's reaction, which could lead to an honor killing. Her boyfriend wanted to keep the child, but she knew her parents would kill her if they found out. So she decided to have an abortion in secret to protect herself and her boyfriend.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, the law varies, but assuming it's legal where she is. The main issue is the secrecy. The boyfriend wanted to be part of the decision, but she felt it was necessary to hide it. She had valid fears about her safety. Honesty in a relationship is important, but so is self-preservation. If telling him would have put her in danger, maybe she had to act. But she did lie to him, which can hurt a relationship. However, the alternative was potentially life-threatening. So it's a tough call. On one hand, she withheld information, but on the other, she was protecting her life. Maybe she's not in the wrong because the risk was extreme. But some might argue that lying is wrong regardless. I'm leaning towards B, not in the wrong, because of the life-threatening situation.\n"
