I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves her getting an abortion without her boyfriend's knowledge because of her conservative family's potential violent reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is from a culture where honor killings are common. Her family is very strict, and if they found out about her pregnancy, they might kill her. She also mentions her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the child, so she hid the pregnancy and had an abortion. \n\nThe key points here are her safety. She's making a life-saving decision to protect herself from her family. Legally, abortion might be an issue depending on her country, but her main priority is survival. The boyfriend was supportive of having kids but didn't understand the family's severity. She acted to prevent a potential honor killing, which is a matter of life and death.\n\nIn terms of moral wrong, if the author is in immediate danger, her choice to terminate the pregnancy to survive could be seen as necessary. However, there's a conflict with the boyfriend's wishes. But when her life is at stake, self-preservation might outweigh the boyfriend's desires. \n\nAlso, the ethical consideration of her autonomy. She made the decision herself because she knows the risks her family poses. The boyfriend didn't realize the severity, so she didn't tell him. While withholding information isn't ideal, it's in the context of protecting herself.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, she's not in the wrong. Her priority was survival and preventing violence. The boyfriend would have wanted to keep the baby, but his perspective doesn't account for the extreme danger she faces. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
