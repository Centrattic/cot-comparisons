I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves getting an abortion without her boyfriend's knowledge due to fears of an honor killing from her conservative family. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, abortion is legal, especially in the early stages. The author was nine weeks pregnant, which is typically within the legal window. So, legally, she's not in the wrong. \n\nNext, the ethical angle. She had a valid reason: her family's extreme reactions. The risk of honor killing is a serious threat. She mentions her cousin was beaten and that her parents would kill her if they knew. Her safety and life are at stake. \n\nShe also considered her boyfriend's feelings. He wanted to keep the baby and support her, but she believed he underestimated the danger. She hid the abortion to protect him from her family. It's a tough choice, but she prioritized her survival.\n\nEmotionally, she's struggling with guilt. She loves the baby but felt forced to make a decision to protect herself. The decision wasn't made lightly, and she's dealing with the aftermath.\n\nThe boyfriend's perspective is important too. He wanted to be a father, but she made the choice to protect both of them. However, keeping such a significant decision hidden could affect their relationship. But given the circumstances, her primary concern was survival.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, many would argue that self-preservation is a strong ethical justification. The alternative was a potential death sentence for her and her boyfriend. So, her actions were a necessary evil.\n\nI should also consider the cultural context. Her family's background in a society where honor killings are common adds pressure. She's navigating two worlds\u2014her boyfriend's supportive attitude versus her family's extreme expectations. \n\nThe key points here are the immediate danger to her life, the legal right to an abortion, and the emotional conflict. While hiding the decision from her boyfriend is a point of contention, the underlying reason is life-threatening. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong. Her actions were driven by necessity to protect herself and her partner from a severe threat.\n"
