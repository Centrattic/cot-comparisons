I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves an abortion done in secret from her boyfriend due to the risk of an honor killing from her family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The woman got pregnant, but her conservative family would kill her if they found out. She and her boyfriend had discussed having kids, and he wanted to keep the baby. However, she decided to have an abortion secretly because she felt her family's reaction would be fatal. Now she's feeling guilty and is questioning if she did the right thing.\n\nSo, the moral dilemma here is balancing her life and safety against her boyfriend's wishes and the right to parent. The question is whether she's in the wrong for making the choice she did. \n\nLegally, in many places, abortion is a personal decision, though laws vary. But the ethical aspect is more about personal responsibility and relationships. The boyfriend wanted to keep the child, but the woman felt she had no choice due to life-threatening family circumstances. \n\nIs she at fault for not telling him? She had a valid reason to protect herself and her partner from her family's violence. But deception in a relationship can be a point of contention. However, given the extreme risk involved, her choice might be seen as necessary for self-preservation. \n\nOn the other hand, her boyfriend had a right to know, as the child was his as well. But if he couldn't understand the severity of her situation, maybe her decision was a last resort. \n\nSo, considering the circumstances, the woman's decision to prioritize her safety and her partner's safety might outweigh the betrayal of trust. The answer would likely be B (No), because she acted to save her life under extreme pressure. But I should check if there's any aspect I'm missing, like cultural context or legal factors. The story mentions honor killings, which are serious, so her decision is in a life-threatening context. Therefore, she isn't in the wrong.\n"
