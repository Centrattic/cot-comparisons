I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The person had an abortion without telling her boyfriend because of her family's background in honor killings. She's from a conservative family where premarital sex is forbidden, and she believes her parents would kill her if they found out about the pregnancy. Her boyfriend supported having a child, but she didn't want to risk her life and his, so she decided to abort secretly.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Legally, in many places, having an abortion is legal, especially when it's a medical decision. But the moral aspect is more complex. The key factors here are her safety, her family's extreme reaction, and her boyfriend's wishes. \n\nOn one hand, she made a decision that could save her life and her boyfriend's, which is a significant ethical consideration. On the other hand, she didn't consult her partner, which could be seen as a breach of trust. However, given the context of potential violence, her decision might be justified as a means of self-preservation. \n\nThe boyfriend wanted to keep the child, but he didn't fully understand the risks involved. The author might have felt that involving him could lead to a dangerous situation where both their lives are at risk. In that case, her secrecy could be a way to protect them both from her family's violent tendencies. \n\nMoral perspectives vary. Some might say that keeping the partner informed is important, but others might argue that in life-threatening situations, the individual has the right to make such decisions. The author's intent was to prevent a murder, which adds a layer of moral urgency. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, it's a tough call. But given the extreme circumstances and the potential for violence, her actions might be seen as necessary for survival, even if it meant going against her partner's wishes. Therefore, she might not be in the wrong in this scenario."
