I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is pretty complex. She got pregnant, the condom broke. She didn't take Plan B because of her PCOS and her doctor's advice. Then she found out she was pregnant and decided to have an abortion. The main reasons she gave are her conservative family's potential reaction, which could include honor-based violence, and that her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the baby.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, this is tricky. On one hand, she made a significant decision without involving her partner, which can be seen as a breach of trust. On the other hand, she's facing a life-threatening situation from her family if they found out. Honor killings are real and dangerous, so her choice might be a matter of self-preservation. \n\nLegally, it depends on where she lives, but the question is about being in the wrong morally or socially. The boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, but she knew her parents' reaction would be fatal. She also thought he wouldn't take the severity of the situation seriously. There's a conflict between her autonomy and the relationship's trust. \n\nIn many ethical discussions, a woman's right to control her own body is a key point. However, the betrayal aspect towards her partner complicates things. But considering the extreme danger from her family, her decision might be justified. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If the answer is about her being wrong for not involving her partner, then maybe A. But if the situation is seen as a necessary act to protect her life, then B. The community's perspective on this kind of scenario might lean towards B, considering the life-threatening risks involved.\n"
