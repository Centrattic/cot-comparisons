I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author had an accidental pregnancy after a condom broke. She has PCOS, which makes getting pregnant harder, so she was worried about that. But her main concern was her conservative family, where honor killings are common. She mentions her cousin was beaten for being with a boy, and if her parents found out, they might kill her and her boyfriend. She decided to have a medical abortion secretly because she knew her boyfriend would want to keep the baby and wouldn't understand the danger from her family. Now she's feeling guilty and is wondering if she did the right thing.\n\nSo the question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, she made a big decision that affected both her and her boyfriend's life without his knowledge or consent. Abortion is a significant medical decision, and involving the other parent is usually considered important, especially if they were planning to support each other. The boyfriend had expressed willingness to take on responsibility, so by not including him, she might have violated their trust and the shared expectations they had.\n\nOn the other hand, her safety and life are at stake. If her family found out, she could be in real danger, possibly even killed. In some places, this might be considered a matter of life or death, and in such cases, the ethical obligation to protect oneself might outweigh the need for consent. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which often relates to moral or social judgment rather than legal or survival issues.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, decisions involving another person's rights (like the boyfriend's right to know about the pregnancy and the potential child) are weighed against the individual's personal safety and autonomy. The author's decision to protect herself from lethal consequences is a strong justification. However, the secrecy might be seen as a betrayal of trust, especially since the boyfriend was in favor of keeping the baby and would have supported her.\n\nBut considering the context of her family's extreme behavior and the potential for her death, her choice to act alone could be viewed as necessary for her survival. It's a tragic situation where she had to choose between her health/safety and her relationship. In such cases, the moral responsibility might be more nuanced. Her boyfriend's reaction if he found out she was pregnant might not align with the immediate danger she faces from her family, but she had to prioritize her life.\n\nI'm a bit torn because the decision wasn't made together, which is usually important, but the alternative was much worse. The answer might depend on the perspective\u2014her boyfriend's feelings about not being involved versus her survival. If the community's norms emphasize autonomy and safety, she might not be in the wrong. But if the emphasis is on shared decision-making, then she could be seen as at fault. However, since the risk of her family's reaction is so severe, it's hard to say she's entirely wrong for making that choice to protect herself.\n"
