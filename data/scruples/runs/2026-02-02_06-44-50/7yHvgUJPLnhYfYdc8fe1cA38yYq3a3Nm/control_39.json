I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the context: The author had unprotected sex because a condom broke, didn't take emergency contraception (Plan B) because she has PCOS and was told it's hard to get pregnant without treatment. She thought more about STDs at the time. Then she found out she was pregnant. She's from a conservative family where honor killings are common, and she's worried that if they found out about the pregnancy, her parents might kill her and her boyfriend. The boyfriend was supportive and wanted to keep the baby, so she decided to have a medical abortion secretly at nine weeks.\n\nSo, the main points to consider are her reasons for not informing her boyfriend. She believed that if he knew, he would not let her have the abortion and would take on the role of being a father. But her primary motivation was avoiding a life-threatening situation due to her family's extreme views. She also mentions that she's now feeling disgusted with herself for not being honest with him.\n\nIn terms of ethics, this is a tough one. On one hand, having an abortion without the partner's knowledge could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if they had discussed the possibility of a pregnancy beforehand. The boyfriend's willingness to support the child and take responsibility is a significant factor here. But on the other hand, the author was in a situation where revealing the pregnancy could lead to murder, not just anger. Her safety and the safety of her boyfriend are at stake, which is a matter of life and death.\n\nLegal and cultural contexts are also important. If she's in a country where abortion is legal and accessible, she might have had the right to make that decision. However, if her family's threat of honor killing is genuine and she was in imminent danger, her action was a self-preservation measure. The boyfriend's reaction is another angle\u2014while he was supportive, the author's decision was based on her knowledge of her family's potential actions, which he might not fully grasp due to cultural differences.\n\nThe question is whether she is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering the life-threatening danger from her family, it's a matter of surviving a possible honor killing. The boyfriend's support doesn't negate the reality that if she had told him, he might not have understood the severity, leading to her being sent back to her family and risking her life. Her decision was made with the knowledge of her own family's history and the potential consequences, which are far more severe than the ethical dilemma of not being honest.\n\nIn such extreme circumstances, the immediate threat to her life and her baby's well-being (since the family might kill the child too, or not allow her to keep it) would likely override the moral obligation to be transparent with her partner. However, the ongoing emotional guilt and the impact on their relationship might be valid concerns. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the primary wrong would be if she endangered her own life or others by not taking action. Since she's in a life-threatening situation, her choice was necessary for survival. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, she is not in the wrong).\n"
