I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the abortion story is in the wrong. They mentioned that the author had an abortion secretly from her boyfriend because her conservative family might kill her if they found out. The boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, but the author didn't tell him because she thought he didn't understand the danger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is in a situation where her family is extremely conservative, and there's a real threat of honor-based violence. If her parents found out about the pregnancy or the abortion, they might kill her and her boyfriend. That's a life-threatening scenario. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't tell her boyfriend, who wanted to be involved and support them as a parent. The boyfriend believed they could handle it, but the author knew the risks. So, there's a conflict between the life of the child versus the safety of the mother and her partner. \n\nLegally and ethically, abortion is a personal choice, but the secrecy and the boyfriend's lack of knowledge complicate things. The author had to make a decision under extreme pressure. The key points here are the threat to her life and the boyfriend's, the lack of understanding from the boyfriend about their family's extremism, and the author's belief that keeping the baby would lead to their deaths. \n\nIn some perspectives, the author acted to protect herself and her partner, which is a valid reason. However, not informing the boyfriend might be seen as a betrayal. But given the potential consequences, it's a matter of survival versus honesty. \n\nSo, considering the context of honor killings and the immediate danger, the author's decision to abort and keep it secret might be justified as self-preservation. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
