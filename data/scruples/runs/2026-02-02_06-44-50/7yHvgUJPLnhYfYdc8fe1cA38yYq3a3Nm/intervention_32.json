I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves getting an abortion without the boyfriend's knowledge due to fear of an honor killing from her conservative family. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a broken condom, didn't use Plan B, got pregnant, and then had an abortion secretly. The main reasons given are the extreme risk from her family if they found out, and the belief that her boyfriend wouldn't support the abortion. \n\nOn one hand, the author made a decision that her partner wasn't part of. The boyfriend had expressed support for having a child, so by not telling him, she's keeping this critical decision private. That could be seen as a betrayal of trust, which might make her the asshole (AITA). \n\nBut on the other hand, the author is in a life-threatening situation. Her family's potential reaction is severe and violent, which is a valid fear. She might be protecting herself and her partner from danger. Also, her decision to have the abortion was to prevent a forced marriage or harm, which could be seen as self-preservation. \n\nThe question is whether withholding such a significant decision from her partner is wrong. In relationships, open communication is usually important. However, the stakes here are extremely high\u2014her life and safety are at risk. If she had told her boyfriend, he might not have understood the severity and could have tried to prevent her from getting the abortion, which could have led to her family finding out. \n\nSo, the author's actions were motivated by fear of immediate danger. While keeping it a secret might be ethically questionable, the circumstances are extreme. The boyfriend's perspective is that he would have supported her, but the author believed otherwise. Her judgment about her family's reaction is based on her own experience, whereas the boyfriend's view is more idealistic. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a complex situation. The author acted to save her life, which is a strong ethical justification. However, the lack of communication with her partner complicates things. But given the life-threatening context, many might argue she was right to act in her own survival. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because her primary motivation was self-preservation in a dangerous situation.\n"
