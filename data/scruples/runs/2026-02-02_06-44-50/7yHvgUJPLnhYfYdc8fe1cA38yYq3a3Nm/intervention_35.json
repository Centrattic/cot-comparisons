I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman who had an abortion without telling her boyfriend because she was afraid of being subjected to an honor killing by her conservative family if they found out. The boyfriend wanted to stay with her and take responsibility, but she hid the pregnancy because she knew her parents would react violently.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects here. The author had a reason to keep the abortion secret: her safety and the safety of her boyfriend. Honor killings are a serious issue, and her fear isn't baseless. She also mentions her cousin was beaten for being with a boy, so her family's reaction is a real threat.\n\nBut then there's the aspect of her boyfriend's wishes. He expressed a desire to be a father and support the child. By not consulting him, she took a decision that affects him as well. However, she knew if she told him, he wouldn't let her have the abortion. So the conflict is between her life and her partner's expectations. \n\nIn many cases, AITA (Am I the Asshole) threads consider intentions and consequences. Her intention was to protect both herself and her partner from a life-threatening situation. The consequence is that her boyfriend was kept in the dark, which might cause hurt feelings. But the immediate danger she faced is life-threatening, which is a more severe consequence than the relationship issue. \n\nAlso, the author is struggling with guilt, indicating she values her relationship and the life of the baby but felt forced into a decision due to her family's extreme views. The question is whether hiding the pregnancy was the right choice given the circumstances. \n\nLegally, in many places, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, which includes having an abortion. However, the moral component here is more complex. She had to weigh the risk of her family's violence against her partner's right to know. But in a life-or-death situation, self-preservation is a strong argument. \n\nThe boyfriend might feel betrayed, but the author's decision was made to prevent a much worse outcome. The community often looks at the context\u2014like threats to life and safety\u2014as a mitigating factor. So while it's a tough choice, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she was trying to protect herself and her partner from a far more severe consequence. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because her actions were driven by a critical need to avoid harm, and she made the decision after considering her partner's potential reaction. The boyfriend might be upset, but the situation is more about survival and safety than personal selfishness.\n"
