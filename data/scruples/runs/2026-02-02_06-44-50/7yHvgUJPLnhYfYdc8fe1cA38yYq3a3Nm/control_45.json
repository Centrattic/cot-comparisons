I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she had a pregnancy and decided to have an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The main reasons she gives are her conservative family background, the risk of honor killings, and her belief that her boyfriend wouldn't support the abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Honor killings are a serious issue in some cultures, and the author's family is described as very conservative. If they found out about the pregnancy before marriage, it could lead to severe consequences, even her death. That's a life-threatening situation. She also mentions that her boyfriend didn't fully understand the severity of her family's reaction. \n\nThe question is whether keeping the pregnancy a secret and having an abortion makes her \"in the wrong.\" Legally, in many places, abortion is a woman's right, so from that standpoint, she might not be in the wrong. Ethically, it's more complex. She had to choose between her life and the life of the fetus. Since her family's actions could kill her, prioritizing her own life is a survival choice. \n\nHer boyfriend thought he would support her if she got pregnant, but she believed he wouldn't support the abortion. There's a conflict between her safety and his wishes. However, she chose to make the decision herself to protect them both from her family. \n\nHiding the pregnancy might be seen as dishonest by some, but in a life-threatening scenario, the ethics of self-preservation might override that. The trauma she's experiencing post-abortion also shows she's struggling with the decision, indicating it wasn't made lightly. \n\nSo, considering the risks she faced and her efforts to protect herself and her boyfriend, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong). Her actions were to prevent a much worse outcome.\n"
