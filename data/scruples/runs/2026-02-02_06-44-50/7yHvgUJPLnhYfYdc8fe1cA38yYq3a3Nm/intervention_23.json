I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\".

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves an abortion done secretly by the author without telling her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author had a condom break, didn't take Plan B, got pregnant. Her boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, but she decided to have an abortion secretly because of her family's conservative background, fearing honor-based violence. She was concerned for her safety and his if they found out. Now she's feeling guilty for not telling him and is questioning if she was wrong.\n\nSo, the main points here: her decision to hide the pregnancy and abortion from her boyfriend. The boyfriend believed they would keep the baby if she got pregnant. She felt she had no choice due to her family's extreme views. Her reasoning is that her life and her boyfriend's life were in danger. She's also dealing with emotional turmoil post-abortion.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my perspective. The question is whether she's in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nLegally, in most places, a woman has the right to make reproductive decisions. However, the ethical aspect is more complex. The boyfriend was supportive of having the baby, so by not involving him, she may have disregarded his potential parental rights and feelings. On the other hand, she had valid fears for her safety and her family's extreme actions. \n\nHonor killings are a serious threat in some cultures. If she had told her family, it could lead to her and her boyfriend's deaths. The boyfriend didn't believe the severity of the threat, but she did. She had to make a choice between her life, her boyfriend's life, and the baby. Given the circumstances, her decision might be seen as a necessary sacrifice to survive.\n\nHowever, withholding such a significant decision from her partner could be seen as a breach of trust. The boyfriend was part of the situation; the baby was his as well. But in a life-threatening scenario, her priority was survival. \n\nIn AITA contexts, the community often considers intent, safety, and ethical dilemmas. Here, the author's primary concern was survival, which is a strong factor in absolving her of wrongdoing. The boyfriend's disappointment is valid, but her actions were protective.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). The author made a difficult choice to protect herself and her partner from a life-threatening situation, even though it meant going against her partner's wishes. Her actions were driven by necessity rather than selfishness.\n"
