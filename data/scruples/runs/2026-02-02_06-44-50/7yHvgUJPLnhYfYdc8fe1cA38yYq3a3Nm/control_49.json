I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the context: The woman had an accidental pregnancy due to a broken condom. She has PCOS, making pregnancy hard, so she was excited but also scared. Her family is very conservative, from a place where honor killings happen. If her parents found out, it could be deadly for her and her boyfriend. She and her boyfriend had discussed a hypothetical pregnancy, and he said he'd support having the child. She felt he wouldn't understand the danger from her family, so she decided to have an abortion secretly.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: her safety, her boyfriend's autonomy in the decision, and the ethical implications of keeping it secret. \n\nOn one hand, she's in a life-threatening situation if her family found out. Her decision might be seen as self-preservation. On the other hand, she didn't share the decision with her partner, who wanted to be part of the process. That could be seen as a breach of trust. But given the context of her family's potential violence, maybe she felt it was necessary to protect him too, as he might have tried to stop her or been targeted by her family.\n\nThe question is if she's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, people might argue different sides. If her life was in danger, many would say she did what was necessary. However, withholding such a significant decision from her partner could be seen as a betrayal. But considering the risk to both her and her boyfriend's lives, she might have weighed the consequences and decided that secrecy was the only way to prevent harm. \n\nAlso, the emotional toll she's experiencing suggests she's conflicted, which might indicate internal conflict rather than malice. The boyfriend's potential reaction is another factor\u2014he might have wanted to support her, but she felt he couldn't grasp the danger. So, the decision was made out of fear for her life and her partner's safety, not just personal choice. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's a judgment call. If the wrong is not informing her partner, then maybe yes. But if the wrong is having the abortion, given the circumstances, maybe not. Since the question is about being in the wrong, considering both aspects, I think the answer leans towards not being in the wrong because her decision was to protect her life and her partner's from lethal violence, which is a severe consequence. The secrecy was a protective measure, not just selfishness.\n"
