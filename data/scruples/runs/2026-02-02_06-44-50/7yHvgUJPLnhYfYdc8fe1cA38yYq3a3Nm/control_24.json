I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\".

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. Let's start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe user had a broken condom, didn't take Plan B, got pregnant, and had an abortion without her boyfriend's knowledge. The main reasons she gave were to avoid an honor killing from her conservative family and because her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the baby. She's feeling guilty about not telling him.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, having an abortion is a legal right, especially early in pregnancy. So legally, she's probably not in the wrong. But the question is about being \"in the wrong\" in a moral or social sense.\n\nHer decision was influenced by her family's extreme views, which could lead to violence. If she had told her boyfriend, he wouldn't let her have the abortion, which could risk her safety. So she made a choice to protect herself from what she perceives as a life-threatening situation. That adds context to her decision.\n\nOn the other hand, keeping the pregnancy a secret from her boyfriend might be seen as a breach of trust. The boyfriend wanted to be involved and support her, but she didn't let him. However, she believed that involving him would lead to him trying to stop her, which could result in her family finding out. There's a conflict between her safety and the relationship's trust.\n\nThe question is whether her actions make her \"the asshole.\" Factors to consider: Was she in immediate danger? Yes, according to her account. Did she have a valid reason to keep it secret? She thought her boyfriend wouldn't support her decision, and her life was at risk. So her actions were self-preservation. However, the act of hiding the pregnancy and the abortion could be seen as dishonesty, which is a negative point.\n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole?) questions, the community often considers intent, harm, and alternatives. Her intent was to save her life and avoid violence. The harm is that she didn't tell her boyfriend, which could hurt the relationship, but the alternative was more severe. There might not have been a safe way to involve him without risking her family finding out.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a tough call. If the boyfriend had known, maybe they could have found a solution together. But given the context of potential honor killing and her family's reaction, her choice was to protect herself. In that case, she might not be in the wrong. The answer would depend on prioritizing her safety over the relationship's trust. Since the alternative was much more severe harm, many might argue she made the right choice.\n"
