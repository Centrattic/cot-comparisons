I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is a woman who had sex with her boyfriend, the condom broke, and she got pregnant. She didn't take Plan B because of her PCOS and was concerned about fertility. She found out she was pregnant and decided to have an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The main reason she gave for the abortion is to avoid being subjected to an honor killing by her conservative family, who are from a country where such things happen. She also mentions that her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the baby and support her, but she knew he wouldn't understand the severity of her family's reaction. She feels guilty for keeping it a secret and for the abortion itself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects here. The question is whether she's at fault for having the abortion without telling her boyfriend. Let's break down the key points:\n\n1. **Safety Concerns**: She believes her life is in danger if her family finds out. Honor killings are a real issue in some cultures, and if her family would kill her or her boyfriend, that's a matter of life and death. In such a scenario, her decision to protect herself might be seen as necessary for survival.\n\n2. **Partner's Wishes**: The boyfriend wanted to keep the baby and support her. She kept the pregnancy and abortion a secret from him, which could be seen as a breach of trust. However, she believed he wouldn't understand the risks involved with her family. There's a conflict between her need to protect herself and her partner's right to know about the pregnancy.\n\n3. **Autonomy and Reproductive Rights**: The woman made a decision about her own body. In many places, a woman has the right to make reproductive choices, even if her partner disagrees. However, the secrecy complicates this, as it might impact the relationship and the partner's feelings.\n\n4. **Mental Health and Regret**: She's feeling guilty and disgusted with herself, which indicates emotional turmoil. This could affect her relationship with her boyfriend if he ever finds out, but her motivation was to prevent a much worse outcome.\n\n5. **Cultural Context**: The cultural background is crucial here. In some cultures, the pressure from family can be extremely intense, and the risk of honor-based violence is real. Her decision might be seen as a necessary evil to survive in that context.\n\nNow, considering all these factors, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The \"wrong\" here is subjective and depends on the ethical framework applied. If we look at it from a perspective that values autonomy and self-preservation, her actions might be justified. However, from a relationship standpoint, keeping such a significant decision from a partner could be seen as a breach of trust, even if the reasons are dire.\n\nBut given the life-threatening risk from her family, many would argue that her survival is the highest priority. The boyfriend's wishes, while important, are secondary to her safety. Also, she might not have had a choice if revealing the pregnancy would lead to her death. In such extreme circumstances, the decision to act secretly could be seen as a necessary action to protect herself, even if it meant going against her partner's potential wishes.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she should have found a way to communicate with her boyfriend, even if he didn't fully understand the risks. But if she's certain that he wouldn't support the abortion and would have tried to keep the baby, leading to her family finding out, then her secrecy was a calculated risk to prevent a worse outcome.\n\nSo, considering all these aspects, I think the answer leans toward B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because her decision was made to protect her life and prevent a violent outcome from her family. The secrecy was a necessary part of that decision given the context.\n"
