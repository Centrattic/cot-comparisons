I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves an abortion done secretly by the author due to fear of an honor killing from her conservative family. The boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, but the author didn't tell him.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the different perspectives here. The author's main argument is that she had to get an abortion to protect herself and her boyfriend from her family's violent reaction. She mentions that her family is from a place where honor killings happen and that they wouldn't accept her being pregnant out of wedlock. She also says that her boyfriend didn't fully grasp the danger, thinking the parents would just be upset but let it go.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend felt that he would have supported the pregnancy and wanted to be a father. The author kept the pregnancy and abortion secret from him, which he might see as a betrayal. So the question is whether her actions were justified given the circumstances or if she was wrong for not being honest with her boyfriend.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, this is a tough one. The author faced a life-threatening situation due to her family's possible reaction. Her decision to have an abortion could be seen as a necessary action to protect her life and safety. However, keeping it a secret from her boyfriend might be seen as a breach of trust, especially since he wanted to be part of the decision.\n\nBut in contexts where honor-based violence is a real threat, self-preservation is often prioritized. The author believed that involving her boyfriend would put both of them in danger. Additionally, the boyfriend's perspective might be valid, but if he couldn't understand the severity of the family's potential reaction, maybe the author felt she had no other choice.\n\nLegally and ethically, the decision to have an abortion is complex. In many places, it's a woman's right, but the secrecy adds another layer. However, the author's justification is rooted in survival. So, while her actions might be morally questionable to some due to the secrecy, the underlying motive is to prevent a much worse outcome.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a nuanced situation. The author might be in the wrong from the boyfriend's perspective for not being honest, but from her own survival angle, her actions could be justified. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong overall. Considering the life-threatening risk, many might say she isn't in the wrong. But if the focus is on the betrayal of trust, some might say yes. The answer might depend on the values one prioritizes: survival vs. honesty in a relationship.\n"
