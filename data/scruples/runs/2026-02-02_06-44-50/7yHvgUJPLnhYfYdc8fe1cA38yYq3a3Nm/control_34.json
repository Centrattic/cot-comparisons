I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves getting an abortion without the boyfriend's knowledge due to the risk of honor-based violence from her family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral perspectives. The author had a valid reason: her family is conservative and might kill her for the pregnancy. Honor killings are a real issue in some cultures. She believes that if her parents found out, it would be deadly for her and her boyfriend. She also mentions that her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the baby, so she kept it secret to prevent them both from being harmed. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend was kept in the dark. He thought he would support a child, but she decided without his input. But given the context, she felt it was necessary for survival. The question is whether hiding the pregnancy and making the decision alone makes her the asshole. \n\nLegally and ethically, in many places, a person has the right to make decisions about their own body, especially in life-threatening situations. However, the moral dilemma here is balancing autonomy with the partner's right to know. But given the extreme risk, her choice might be seen as self-preservation. \n\nThe boyfriend might feel betrayed, but the author's life was at stake. In such scenarios, many would argue that prioritizing safety is justified. The key factors are the threat level and her knowledge of her family's actions. Since she's been through a cousin's case, her fear is not unfounded. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Considering the circumstances, she made a choice to protect herself and her partner from lethal harm. While the decision was difficult and may have caused guilt, the intent was survival. Therefore, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
