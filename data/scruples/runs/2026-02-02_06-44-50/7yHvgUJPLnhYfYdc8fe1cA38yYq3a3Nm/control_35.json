I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author had an accidental pregnancy with her boyfriend when the condom broke. She decided to have an abortion without telling him because she feared her conservative family would kill her for being pregnant out of wedlock, even mentioning honor killings. Her boyfriend wanted to keep the baby and didn't understand the severity of the family's reaction. She felt she had to act alone to protect both herself and her boyfriend from her family's violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects. The author faced a life-threatening situation where her family might kill her for the pregnancy. Her boyfriend wasn't aware of how extreme the family's actions could be. By keeping the pregnancy and abortion secret, she was trying to prevent both her death and her boyfriend's potential harm. However, she did this without his consent, which her boyfriend valued as he wanted to be involved and support her.\n\nOn one hand, she made a life-saving decision to protect herself, which is a fundamental right. On the other hand, she didn't share the decision with her partner, which could be seen as a breach of trust. But given the context of her family's extreme actions, she might have believed that involving him would lead to him trying to protect the baby and thus putting both their lives at risk. \n\nThe question is whether she was in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The key points are her safety, the boyfriend's right to know, and the circumstances. Since her life was in danger, her decision to act alone might be justified. The boyfriend might see it as a betrayal, but her survival was at stake. In many ethical frameworks, self-preservation is a priority. So the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because she acted to protect her life under extreme circumstances, even though it involved withholding information.\n"
