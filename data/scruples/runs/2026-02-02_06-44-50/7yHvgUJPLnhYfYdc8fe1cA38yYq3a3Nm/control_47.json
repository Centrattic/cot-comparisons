I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the context is really important here. She's from a conservative family where honor killings are common. Her parents would kill her and possibly her boyfriend if they found out about the pregnancy. She mentions a cousin who was beaten for dating, so the risk is severe. She also says her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the baby and wouldn't have agreed to an abortion. \n\nThe author felt she had no safe option. She couldn't tell her parents because of the danger, and she couldn't tell her boyfriend because he would oppose the abortion. So she made the decision to protect herself and her boyfriend. \n\nNow, the ethical angle. The user is asking if she's in the wrong. Legally, abortion is a complex issue depending on the country, but the main moral question here is about her decision-making under coercion and fear. She had to choose between having a child in a life-threatening situation or terminating the pregnancy to avoid immediate danger. \n\nFrom a deontological perspective, lying to her boyfriend might be seen as morally wrong. But from a consequentialist or utilitarian view, her actions prevented a probable death, which is a greater good. Also, she was under immense pressure and had a valid reason to protect her life. \n\nThe boyfriend's perspective is that he was excluded from the decision. But if he had known, he might have tried to convince her not to abort, which could have led to them being discovered. Her choice was made in a context of survival. \n\nSo, considering all factors: imminent danger to her life, lack of support from her family, and her boyfriend's likely opposition, the decision was made to prevent greater harm. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
