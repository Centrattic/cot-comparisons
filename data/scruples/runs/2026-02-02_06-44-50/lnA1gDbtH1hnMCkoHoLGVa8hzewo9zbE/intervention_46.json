Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial.\n\nFirst, the situation: The kids are 6 and 9. Their grandfather died. They already attended the viewings and wake, which were on Friday and Saturday. The kids were upset, especially seeing their grandfather in a casket. The burial is on Monday, which is a school day. The kids have tests today. They said they didn't want to go. The author let them go to school. The ex-MIL is upset because the kids aren't attending the burial. The author is asking if they're the asshole for not forcing the kids to go.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to decide based on the situation.\n\nFactors to consider: The kids' emotional well-being. They already had a hard time with the viewings. The burial is on a school day with tests. The kids themselves don't want to go. The author explained that the kids had already said goodbye. The ex-MIL is upset, but that's on the ex's side. The author's decision seems to prioritize the children's needs and their own wishes.\n\nIs it wrong to not force children to attend a funeral if they don't want to? It depends on cultural norms, but in many places, especially in the US, children are allowed to have some say in such matters. Also, considering their age and emotional state, pushing them might be harmful. The school is important, and the tests are on that day. The kids' well-being seems prioritized here. The author didn't force the kids to go, respected their choice, and explained the situation to the ex-MIL. The ex-MIL's reaction is understandable, but the author isn't obligated to her. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
