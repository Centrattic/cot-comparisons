Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial.\n\nFirst, the context: The children are 6 and 9 years old. Their grandfather, who they were very close to, passed away. The parents are divorced and not on good terms, but the author loved their ex-FIL. The kids already attended the viewings and wake on Friday and Saturday, which were emotionally tough for them. The burial is on Monday, a school day with tests. The kids themselves said they didn't want to go, feeling they already said goodbye. The ex-MIL is upset, but the author is sticking by the kids' wishes.\n\nNow, considering the children's ages and the fact that they've already attended multiple events, it's reasonable to think they might not want to go again, especially if they're dealing with school. Forcing them could be traumatic. The author listened to their children's feelings, which is a good parenting move. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable, but the author's priority is the kids' well-being. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. They respected the kids' emotions and the school commitment. The key points are the children's well-being, their own wishes, and the practical aspect of school tests. The answer should be B (No).\n"
