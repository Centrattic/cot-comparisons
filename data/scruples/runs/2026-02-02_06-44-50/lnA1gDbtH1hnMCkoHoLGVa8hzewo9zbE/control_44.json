Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of their grandfather's burial. The situation is that the kids were already at the viewings and the wake, which were on Friday and Saturday. The burial is on Monday, and the kids have tests. They didn't want to go because they found it hard to see their grandfather in the casket. The ex-MIL is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. The kids are 6 and 9, which is pretty young. They already experienced the viewings and wake, which were emotional. The parent is choosing not to force them to attend the burial, respecting their wishes. That seems considerate of their emotional state. Parents often prioritize their children's comfort, especially in traumatic times.\n\nThen, the grandfather was a Veteran, so the burial might be at a specific cemetery, but the parent isn't involved in that part. The ex-MIL is upset, but maybe that's more about her feelings than the kids. The parent is not on good terms with the ex, but had a good relationship with the ex-FIL. The key here is whether the parent is obligated to make the kids attend the burial. Since the kids expressed not wanting to go and the parent is respecting that, it's more about their consent.\n\nCultural expectations might play a role. In some cultures, attending a funeral is important, but the parent is considering the children's emotional health. Also, the burial is a small event with a few family members, so maybe the kids were allowed to opt out without being present for the whole ceremony. The parent isn't making the kids go to school in bad faith; they have legitimate school commitments.\n\nSo, the parent is not being selfish but is acting in the best interest of the kids. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable but the parent isn't in the wrong for prioritizing the children's needs. Answering B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
