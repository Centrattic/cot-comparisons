Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The situation is that the kids were already at the viewings and wake, which were emotionally tough for them. Now, the burial is on a Monday, and they have tests at school. The kids themselves don't want to go, so the author sends them to school. The ex-MIL is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. The kids are 6 and 9, young, and dealing with grief. They had a hard time at the viewings. The author is prioritizing their emotional state by respecting their wishes not to attend the burial. Also, the burial is on a school day, and they have tests. There's an educational aspect here too.\n\nThe author's ex-MIL is upset because she expected the kids to be there. But the author is the one making the decision, and the kids themselves don't want to go. It's important to consider the children's autonomy in this case. Forcing them could cause more trauma. The author is balancing school commitments with the kids' emotional needs.\n\nAnother point is the practicality. The burial is on a Monday, which is a school day. Missing school for another funeral event might not be feasible, especially with tests. The author has already taken time off for the previous services. The kids have already had time to process the loss, and the burial is a more formal event with a small group. The author's decision seems reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nI think the key factors are the children's emotional state, their own wishes, and the educational obligations. The author isn't being cruel; they're being considerate of the kids' feelings. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
