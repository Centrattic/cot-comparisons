Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The situation involves a divorce, the kids being young (6 and 9), and the grandfather's funeral details.\n\nFirst, the kids already missed school for the viewings and the wake. They were emotional and had a hard time seeing their grandfather in the casket. The burial is a Monday, and they have tests. The author asked the kids if they wanted to attend, and they declined. The ex-MIL is upset about it.\n\nFrom a parent's perspective, the children's well-being is a priority. Young kids might not fully understand the finality of death, and the author is respecting their emotional needs by not forcing them to go. The kids said they'd already said goodbye, so pushing them to attend might cause more trauma. The ex-MIL's upset reaction is understandable, but the author is prioritizing the children's current emotional state over the expectations of the ex's family. \n\nIn such cases, the parent's decision to let the kids choose is usually considered the right move. The author isn't forcing them to attend, which aligns with child psychology advice that emphasizes respecting a child's feelings during bereavement. So, the answer is likely B (No). However, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong, so I need to make sure there's no cultural or situational factor I'm missing. But given the information, the author is making a compassionate choice for the children.\n"
