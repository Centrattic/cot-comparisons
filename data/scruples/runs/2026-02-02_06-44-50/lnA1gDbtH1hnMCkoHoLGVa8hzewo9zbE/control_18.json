Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial. The main points here are the children's well-being versus family expectations.\n\nFirst, the kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already attended two viewings and a wake, which were emotionally taxing. The grandfather was a significant figure in their lives, and they had difficulty processing the loss. The funeral is on a Monday, and they have tests. The children themselves don't want to go again, saying they've already said goodbye. \n\nThe ex-MIL is upset, but the author prioritized the children's emotional state and their school commitments. The ex-MIL's reaction might stem from cultural or family expectations, but the author has to balance that with the kids' needs. \n\nThe author is a parent, and their primary responsibility is to their children's well-being. Forcing them to attend might cause more trauma, especially since they've already been through multiple services. The school has tests on the burial day, but that's a secondary point compared to the emotional aspect.\n\nIn these situations, respecting the children's wishes and their emotional state is crucial. The author isn't in the wrong for making a decision that protects their kids' mental health. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable, but it's the author's call as a parent. So the answer should be B.\n"
