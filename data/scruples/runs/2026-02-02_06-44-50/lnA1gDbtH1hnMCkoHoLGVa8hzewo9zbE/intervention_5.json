Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sending their kids to the grandfather's burial. The situation is that the kids are 6 and 9 years old, they've already been to the viewings and wake, and they didn't want to go to the burial, which is on a Monday when they have school. The ex-MIL is upset because they weren't there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. The kids were already distressed at the viewings and wake. Making them attend the burial might add more trauma. The author listened to the kids' wishes, which is important because they are the ones experiencing the emotions. Also, the kids are young, and the school has tests. Missing school just for the burial might not be necessary, especially since they've already had time to grieve.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex-MIL is upset, which is understandable. Maybe she expected the kids to be there. But the author's decision was based on the children's emotional state and their own requests. The author isn't forcing them, respecting their feelings. \n\nThe key points are the children's emotional state, their own wishes, and the practicality of school. Forcing them to attend could have been more harmful. So, the answer is probably B (author isn't in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no cultural expectation I'm missing. However, since the kids expressed not wanting to go, and they were already traumatized, it's more about their well-being. So B.\n"
