Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The situation is that the kids are 6 and 9, they already attended viewings and a wake, and they didn't want to go to the burial. The mom sent them to school because they had tests. The ex-MIL is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. At 6 and 9, they're very young. Attending a funeral, especially a burial, which is more somber and formal, might be too intense for them. They already had a hard time seeing their grandfather in the casket, so forcing them to attend another event might cause more emotional distress.\n\nThe mom explained that the kids had already said goodbye. It's important to respect the children's feelings here. If they're not comfortable attending, making them go could be traumatic. Also, they had school tests, which are scheduled events. The mom had to balance the child's education and their well-being. \n\nThe ex-MIL's reaction is understandable, but the mom's decision is about the kids' best interest. The ex is the father's side, but the mom is the one making the decision now. The divorce situation might complicate things, but the primary concern should be the children's emotional state.\n\nVeteran burial details and the schedule might have made it logistically difficult. The kids were already at the viewings and wake, which they found hard. The burial might not add anything for them. The mom listened to their wishes, which shows she's being sensitive to their needs.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a tough call. Culturally, attending a funeral is seen as important, but when it comes to young children, their emotional health is more critical. The mom isn't wrong for prioritizing her children's feelings and their needs. The ex-MIL's upset is valid, but the mom's choice is reasonable. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
