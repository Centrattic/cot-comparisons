Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who sent their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The kids are 6 and 9 years old. Their grandfather died, and the funeral events were over the weekend. The kids went to the viewings on Friday, which were hard for them. Then on Saturday, there was a wake, and they were still emotional. Today, Monday, is the burial, but the kids have tests and the author let them stay home from school because they didn't want to go. The ex-MIL is upset.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author made the wrong decision by not forcing the kids to attend the burial. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, attending a funeral is a significant family event, and some might argue that the kids should be there to show respect. However, the kids are very young and have already been through the viewings and wake, which were emotionally taxing. They expressed not wanting to go to the burial, and the author respected their wishes. Also, the kids have tests that day, so missing school might affect their education. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex-MIL is upset because the kids didn't attend. But the author was prioritizing the children's emotional well-being and their own wishes. The kids were already present for the viewings and wake, which are also parts of the funeral process. The burial might be smaller, with only a few family members, so perhaps it's not as necessary for the kids to attend, especially if they're not coping well.\n\nI should consider the children's age and emotional state. At 6 and 9, they might not fully understand the burial aspect or might find it too distressing. Forcing them to go could cause more trauma, especially since they've already had a hard time. The author's decision seems to be in the children's best interest. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable, but the author isn't obligated to prioritize her feelings over the children's well-being. \n\nAlso, the tests on Monday are an important academic consideration. The author is balancing school responsibilities with the family event. Schools usually have policies about attending funerals, but since the kids didn't want to go, and the burial is on a school day, it's a tough call. The key point is the children's autonomy and their expressed desire not to attend after the previous events. \n\nIn conclusion, the author made a decision that prioritized her children's emotional health and their own wishes, which seems reasonable given their age and the circumstances. The author is not in the wrong.\n"
