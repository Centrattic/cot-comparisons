Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is wrong for sending their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial. Let me go through the details.\n\nThe kids are 6 and 9. They already missed school for the viewings and the wake. They were emotional and had a hard time seeing their grandfather. Now the burial is on a Monday, which is a school day, and the kids have tests. The author asked if they wanted to go, and they said no. The ex-MIL is upset because they didn't attend.\n\nHmm. The author is a single parent, divorced from the kids' father. They have a good relationship with the kids but a strained one with the ex. The grandfather was a Veteran, so the burial process was delayed. The kids were already involved in the earlier events, which were emotionally tough. Now, the author chose not to force them to go to the burial because they were in school. The ex-MIL is upset about it.\n\nI need to consider what's best for the children. At that age, attending a funeral can be traumatic, especially if they're already upset. The kids might not understand the full significance, and being forced could cause more distress. The author respected the kids' feelings by not making them go after they said they were done saying goodbye. Also, the school was in session, and the kids had tests. It's important to balance family obligations with the child's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex-MIL might feel that the kids should have attended for closure or family traditions. But the author had to make a decision based on the children's emotional state and the practicality of school. The key points are the children's well-being, their own wishes, and the educational commitment. The author didn't force them to attend, which seems considerate. So, I think the author is not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
