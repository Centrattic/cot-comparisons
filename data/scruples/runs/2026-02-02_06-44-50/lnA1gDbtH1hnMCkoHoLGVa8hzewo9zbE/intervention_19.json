Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The author's kids are 6 and 9 years old. They had already attended the viewings and the wake, which were emotionally tough for them. The burial is on a Monday, and the kids have tests. They didn't want to go, so the parent sent them to school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. Young kids, especially those age, can find funerals very distressing. They've already been through two viewings and a wake, which were hard. The parent mentions the kids cried and it was a difficult weekend. Forcing them to attend another event might cause more trauma. The parent also respects the ex-FIL, so it's not about not valuing the event but about the kids' emotional health.\n\nThe ex-MIL is upset because the kids aren't attending. But the parent isn't the one who divorced the ex; it's the other parent. The parent is making the decision based on the kids' current emotional state and their own wishes. The kids said they had already said goodbye, so the parent is respecting their feelings. \n\nLegally and ethically, parents have the right to make decisions about their children's attendance at such events. The key factors here are the children's age, their emotional state, and their expressed wishes. The parent isn't ignoring the funeral entirely; the kids were at the viewings and wake. The burial is the final part, but the kids don't want to go. The parent is choosing the kids' comfort over the ex-MIL's expectations.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might think kids should attend funerals, but others understand that very young children might not be ready. The parent is being considerate of their needs, which is a responsible approach. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
