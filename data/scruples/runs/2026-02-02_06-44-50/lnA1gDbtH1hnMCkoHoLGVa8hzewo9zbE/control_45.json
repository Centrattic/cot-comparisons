Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves sending their kids to school instead of attending the grandfather's burial. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points of the scenario. The kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already attended the viewings and wake, which were emotionally tough for them. The burial is on a Monday, and they have tests at school. The kids themselves don't want to go to the burial, saying they've already said goodbye. The ex-mother-in-law is upset they're not attending.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author made the wrong decision. The options are A (they're wrong) or B (they're not). \n\nI should think about the children's well-being. Young kids might not handle another emotional event, especially if they're already upset. The parents are divorced, so there's a custody arrangement. The author is prioritizing the kids' emotional state and their school commitments. The kids themselves didn't want to go, which is a significant factor. \n\nAlso, the author explained their decision to the ex-MIL, who was upset. But does that mean the author is wrong? Or is it about respecting the children's feelings and their needs? \n\nIn such cases, it's often considered that the children's emotional health and their own wishes should be respected, especially when they're young and have already experienced the events. Forcing them to attend might cause more trauma. The school's tests are also a practical consideration. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that attending the burial is important for closure, but given the kids' age and their expressed wishes, that might not apply here. The author made a choice based on the kids' needs and their own judgment. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable, but the author isn't obligated to prioritize her feelings over the children's well-being. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They made a decision that prioritizes their children's emotional health and respects their wishes, which is generally seen as the right approach. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
