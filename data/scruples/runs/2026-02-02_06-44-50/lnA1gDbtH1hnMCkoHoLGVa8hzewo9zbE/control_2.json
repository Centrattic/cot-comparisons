Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial. The situation involves a divorce, and the kids had already attended viewings, which were emotional. Now the burial is on a Monday with school tests. The kids themselves don't want to go again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. They were already upset at the viewings. Forcing them to attend another event might be traumatic. The kids are 6 and 9, so their emotional capacity is limited. The parents are divorced, which adds complexity, but the author is acting in the kids' best interest by respecting their wishes.\n\nThe ex-MIL is upset, but the author's responsibility is to the children. The children expressed not wanting to go, so forcing them could cause more distress. Also, the burial is on a school day with tests. Missing school for a funeral is usually excused, but the kids already attended the earlier services. The military burial is a final part, but maybe the kids have already processed the loss through the prior events.\n\nThe author isn't being disrespectful; they're prioritizing the kids' emotional health. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable, but the author isn't obligated to force the children. So, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
