Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe kids are 6 and 9 years old. Their grandfather died, and they already missed school for the viewings and the wake. The family had a close relationship, so this is a significant loss. The funeral is on a Monday, and the kids have tests that day. The author asked the kids if they wanted to go to the burial, and they said no. The ex-MIL is upset because the kids aren't attending. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the well-being of the children. They were already traumatized by seeing their grandfather in a casket and dealing with their emotions. Attending another service, especially on a school day with tests, might add more stress. The kids themselves expressed that they felt they had already said goodbye. As a parent, the author might be prioritizing the kids' emotional needs over attending the burial. But maybe there's cultural or family expectations to consider. \n\nIn some cultures, attending a burial is a significant part of mourning, so the ex-MIL's reaction might stem from that. However, the children's mental health is also crucial. Forcing them to attend could be retraumatizing. The author isn't ignoring the funeral entirely; the kids attended the viewings and wake. The burial is a separate event, and the kids seem to have processed their grief up to that point. \n\nAlso, the parent has to balance school responsibilities. The tests are important, and pulling them out might not be feasible. The parent respected the kids' feelings when they said they didn't want to go. That seems like a responsible decision. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground? Perhaps attending part of the burial or finding a way to honor the grandfather without the kids being present. However, the kids are clear in their decision, and the parent is respecting their autonomy. \n\nI think the key points are the children's emotional state, their own wishes, and the parent's role in supporting them. The parent isn't being neglectful; they're making a tough choice to protect their kids' well-being. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable, but the parent's decision is in the best interest of the children. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). \n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Could there be an obligation to the family to attend? But the parent is divorced, and the ex-MIL might not have authority over the children. The parent is making the call as the custodial parent. The kids' mental health is a priority here. So, the answer remains B.\n"
