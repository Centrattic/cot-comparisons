Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The situation is that the kids were already at the viewings and wake, which were emotionally tough for them. They had tests on Monday, and both kids said they had already said goodbye. The author chose to send them to school instead. The ex-MIL is upset.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the children's well-being versus family expectations. The author had the kids attend the viewings, which were hard on them. The kids themselves expressed that they were done, so forcing them to go might be traumatic. Also, the burial is on a Monday, which is a school day, and they have tests. The author is prioritizing the kids' education and emotional state. \n\nBut the other side is the ex-MIL's disappointment. However, the author's decisions were based on the kids' needs. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering the children's age and their own wishes, forcing them to attend could cause unnecessary stress. The author isn't being selfish; they're acting in the kids' best interest. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
