Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The kids are 6 and 9 years old. Their grandfather died, and they already attended the viewings and wake. The burial was on a Monday, and the kids had tests at school. They didn't want to go to the burial, so the parent sent them to school. The ex-mother-in-law is upset that the kids didn't attend the burial.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate this. Let's break it down.\n\nChildren that age might not understand the full significance of a burial. They were already emotional at the viewings and wake. Making them go to another event could be traumatic. The kids themselves didn't want to go, so forcing them against their will might be inappropriate. The parent explained their reasoning, which seems to prioritize the children's well-being and their expressed wishes.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that attending the burial is important for closure and respecting family traditions. However, given the circumstances\u2014the kids' age, their emotional state, their school commitments, and their own refusal\u2014it's reasonable to prioritize their needs here. The parent is divorced from the kids' father, but the decision was made with the kids' input and well-being in mind. The ex-MIL's upset reaction is a family issue, but the parent isn't obligated to satisfy her expectations at the expense of the children's comfort.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong. They made a compassionate choice based on the children's needs and their own wishes.\n"
