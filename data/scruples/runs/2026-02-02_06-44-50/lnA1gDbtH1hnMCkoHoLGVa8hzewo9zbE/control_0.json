Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forcing their kids to attend the grandfather's burial. The situation is that the kids were already at the viewings and wake, which were emotionally tough for them. Now the burial is on a Monday, and the kids have tests at school. They don't want to go again, so the author sends them to school instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. The kids are young (6 and 9) and have already been through the viewings and wake, which were hard for them. The grandfather was their first close family member to pass away. The burial is a smaller event with only a few family members. The ex-MIL is upset that the kids aren't there, but the author is prioritizing the children's emotional state and their school responsibilities.\n\nThe key points here are the children's emotional state and their autonomy. The author respected the kids' wishes by not forcing them to attend, which shows consideration for their feelings. Also, the burial is a smaller event, so maybe the presence of the kids isn't as critical as the earlier services. The author had to balance attending the funeral and the kids' school schedule. Since the kids were already present for the earlier events, the author might feel they've already participated in the mourning process.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family traditions or the ex-MIL's expectations are important. But the author's decision is based on the kids' well-being and their own judgment of what's best for them. The fact that the kids themselves didn't want to go is a strong point in the author's favor. The author isn't being inconsiderate to the ex-MIL, but they're prioritizing the children's needs, which is a parent's responsibility.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a tough choice that prioritized their children's emotional health and school obligations over attending a burial, especially since the kids had already been to the earlier services and didn't want to go again. The answer should be B.\n"
