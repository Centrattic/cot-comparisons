Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The situation involves a divorced parent, the kids are 6 and 9. The grandfather died, and there were viewings on Friday and a wake on Saturday. The kids went to those, were emotional, and now the burial is on Monday when the kids have school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's well-being. Young kids might not be able to handle the stress of another funeral event, especially if they've already experienced the viewings and wake. The author mentioned the kids had a hard time seeing their grandfather in the casket. The burial might be more somber and possibly involve more people, which could overwhelm them. The kids themselves said they had already said goodbye, so forcing them to attend might not be in their best interest.\n\nThen there's the ex-MIL's reaction. She's upset that the kids aren't attending. But the author's decision was based on the children's emotional state and school commitments. The burial is on a Monday, and the kids have tests. Missing school could have academic consequences, but the user might argue that the funeral is more important. However, the kids are very young and might not fully understand the significance of the burial. Their immediate reaction was to decline, and the author respected that.\n\nForcing children to attend a funeral against their will could be traumatic. The author's intention was to protect the kids, and they even had the kids miss school for previous events. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable, but the children's emotional health should be a priority. The author loved the ex-FIL like a father, so not going might feel personal to the mother, but the kids' well-being is key here.\n\nAlso, considering the cultural or religious aspects, some traditions might expect attendance, but since the author is a parent, their responsibility is to the children. The ex-MIL might have high expectations, but the parent has the right to make decisions they think are best for their kids. The children are still mourning, and the parent is managing their grief appropriately without forcing them into another stressful event.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The parent made a compassionate decision based on the kids' needs and their own wishes. It's important to balance family obligations with the immediate well-being of children, especially in a sensitive situation like this.\n"
