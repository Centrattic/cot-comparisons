Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent who sent their kids to school instead of taking them to the grandfather's burial. The kids were already at the viewings and wake, which were emotionally tough for them. Now, the burial is on a Monday, and the kids have tests. They didn't want to go, so the parent decided to send them to school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The kids are 6 and 9 years old. They've already attended two viewings, which were hard on them. They were emotional, and the parent is concerned about their well-being. The burial is on a school day with tests, and the kids themselves don't want to go again. The ex-mother-in-law is upset because the kids aren't attending, but the parent feels it's in the kids' best interest.\n\nIn terms of responsibilities, the parent has to balance honoring the deceased family member and the children's emotional needs. The children are young and have already experienced the loss; forcing them to attend another service might cause more trauma. The parent is respecting the children's wishes, which is important for their mental health.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex-MIL is upset because the kids aren't there, which might reflect on family traditions or expectations. But the parent's priority here is the kids' well-being. Schools have important obligations, and missing tests could affect the children's education. However, the parent had the kids miss school for the viewings and wake, but this time, the kids opted out. \n\nI think the parent made a responsible decision by considering the children's emotional state and their own wishes. The parent isn't forcing the kids to attend, which shows respect for their feelings. The ex-MIL's disappointment is valid, but the parent's role is to prioritize the children's needs. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
