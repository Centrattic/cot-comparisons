Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The situation is a bit complex. The kids are young, 6 and 9 years old. They already attended the viewings and the wake, which were emotional events. The burial is on a Monday, and the kids have school tests today. They themselves didn't want to go.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. Young kids might find funerals stressful, especially if they've already been at the viewings and wake. The kids expressed that they had said goodbye, so forcing them might be traumatic. The mother's decision to prioritize their emotional health and school commitments seems reasonable.\n\nThen there's the ex-MIL's reaction. She's upset because the kids aren't attending. But the mother explained the kids' feelings. Should she have made them go regardless? Maybe not, since the kids are the ones who chose not to attend. The mother respected their choice, which is important for their autonomy.\n\nAlso, the fact that it's a Veteran's burial with a busy cemetery might mean it's a formal event with fewer emotional moments. The ex's family members will be there, but the kids attending might not add to the ceremony if they're not emotionally ready.\n\nLegally, the mother has custody, so she's in charge of the kids' schedule. The ex-MIL is upset, but the mother isn't obligated to attend, let alone force the kids. The key here is the children's emotional state and their own wishes. The mother considered their well-being and made a decision that prioritizes their comfort. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong). She made a compassionate choice based on her children's needs and their own expressed desires.\n"
