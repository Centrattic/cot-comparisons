Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that their ex's father-in-law died, and they sent their kids to school instead of the burial. The kids were already at the viewings on Friday, which were hard for them. The author didn't force the kids to go to the burial because they didn't want to. The ex's mother-in-law is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the kids' well-being. They're 6 and 9 years old. They already had to go to the viewings, which were emotionally tough. The author explained that the kids said they'd already said goodbye, and they were having tests at school. Forcing them to go to another event might add more stress, especially if they're not emotionally ready. Children's emotional health is important, and pushing them to attend might not be the right call here.\n\nNext, the author's decision to prioritize school tests on a Monday. Schools have schedules, and missing tests could affect their education. However, some might argue that attending a family event is more important. But the kids themselves didn't want to go, so maybe the author is respecting their wishes. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex's family is upset. The grandmother is disappointed that the kids didn't attend the burial. Cultural and family expectations might play a role here. In some cultures, attending a funeral is a significant duty. But the author is now the primary caregiver, and the kids's well-being is her responsibility. \n\nThe author explained the kids's feelings and the school schedule. It seems like she made a decision based on the children's emotional state and practical considerations. The question is whether she should have forced them anyway. Since the kids were already traumatized by the viewings, forcing them to another event might not be in their best interest. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions seem to be in the best interest of the children. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
