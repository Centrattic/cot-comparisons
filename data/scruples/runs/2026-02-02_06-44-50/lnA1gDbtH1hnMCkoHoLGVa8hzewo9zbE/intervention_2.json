Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not making their kids go to their grandfather's burial. They had the kids attend the viewings and the wake, which were on Friday and Saturday. The actual burial is on Monday, which is a school day. The kids had tests and didn't want to go. The author sent them to school instead. The ex-MIL is upset about it.\n\nHmm. First, the kids were already at the viewings and the wake. The author mentioned that the kids were emotional and had a hard time seeing their grandfather in the casket. The children themselves said they didn't want to attend the burial. The father's ex-wife is upset, but the author is the one who made the decision based on the kids' wishes and their school schedule.\n\nSo, the key points here are the children's well-being and their own decision-making. The author considered the kids' emotional state and their school responsibilities. The burial is on a Monday, which is a school day, and the kids have tests. The author respected the kids' choice not to attend again. \n\nIs it wrong to prioritize the kids' needs and their own wishes over attending the burial? The ex-MIL is upset, but the author isn't in a good relationship with the ex. The main responsibility here is the children's emotional health. Forcing them to go might be traumatic again. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. They acted in the best interest of their children, considering their feelings and the circumstances. The answer should be B.\n"
