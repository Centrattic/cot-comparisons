Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending the kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe kids are 6 and 9 years old. Their grandfather died, and the funeral was on Monday. They already went to the viewings on Friday and the wake on Saturday. The kids were really upset seeing their grandfather in the casket. Now, the burial is on a Monday, and the kids have school tests. They don't want to go, and the author sends them to school instead. The ex-mother-in-law is upset about it.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author should have made the kids attend the burial. The author is a divorced parent, and the kids are with them. The ex-mother-in-law is upset because the kids aren't going. But the kids themselves don't want to go, especially after the previous viewings were hard on them.\n\nI think the key points here are the children's well-being and their wishes. The kids were already traumatized by seeing their grandfather. Making them go to the burial might cause more distress. Also, the kids are young; forcing them to attend might not be appropriate. The author considered the kids' feelings and their school schedule. The ex-mother-in-law might feel it's important for the kids to be there, but the author is acting in the best interest of the children. \n\nI remember that in similar situations, respecting a child's emotional state is crucial. Forcing them to attend could retraumatize them. The author is not in the wrong because they prioritized the kids' mental health and respected their wishes. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
