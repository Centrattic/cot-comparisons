Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The situation involves a divorced couple, the kids are 6 and 9 years old. The grandfather died, and the kids were at the viewings and wake, but the burial is on a Monday when they have school tests. The kids didn't want to go to the burial, so the author sent them to school. The ex-MIL is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. The kids already had a hard time during the viewings and wake, especially since it's their first family member to pass away. They were emotional, crying. The author made a choice based on the kids' own wishes and their emotional state. Forcing them to attend another event might have been traumatic. \n\nThen there's the aspect of respecting the kids' feelings. The son said he already said goodbye, so forcing them to go might not be appropriate. The author is prioritizing the children's emotional health over attending the burial. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex-MIL is upset, so maybe there's a cultural expectation or family tradition that the burial should be attended by the grandchildren. But the author's main responsibility is to the children's well-being. \n\nAlso, the burial is a smaller event with a few family members. The kids had already participated in the earlier events, which might be sufficient in terms of their mourning process. \n\nSchool tests are important, but maybe not as critical as the child's mental health. Sending them to school when they're still processing grief could be seen as neglecting their emotional needs. \n\nThe author communicated with the ex-MIL and explained the situation, but the ex-MIL was still upset. However, the author had the kids' best interests in mind. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. The decision was based on the children's emotional state and their own wishes. It's important to respect the child's feelings during such a time. So the answer should be B.\n"
