Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The situation involves a divorced parent, the kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already attended viewings and a wake over the weekend, which were emotionally tough for them. The burial is on a Monday, and the kids have tests at school. They declined to go to the burial, so the parent sent them to school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the kids' emotional well-being. The kids are young and already found the viewings and wake difficult. Forcing them to attend another event might cause more distress. The parent mentioned that the kids said they already said goodbye, so respecting their wishes seems important here.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of their education. The tests are scheduled, and attending the burial would mean missing school. While funerals are important, so is the kids' education, especially with scheduled tests. The parent is balancing practical considerations here.\n\nThe ex-MIL is upset, but the parent had to prioritize the children's comfort and their commitments. The parent considered the kids' feelings and their own decision to not attend. The ex-MIL's reaction is a conflict point, but the parent isn't obligated to satisfy the other parent's family's expectations. \n\nLegally and ethically, parents have the right to make decisions based on their children's best interests. The kids were already involved in the earlier events, and the parent is respecting their current wishes. There's no indication of neglect or disregard for the deceased; the parent loved the grandfather and involved the kids in the earlier services.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the parent isn't in the wrong. They made a tough decision based on the children's emotional state and educational needs. Answer B.\n"
