Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not making their kids go to the grandfather's burial. The situation is that the kids already attended the viewings and the wake, which were more emotional. They had tests at school on the burial day, and the kids themselves didn't want to go. The ex-MIL is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. The kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already had a hard time at the viewings and the wake. Forcing them to go to the burial might be too traumatic, especially since they said they already said goodbye. The parents' responsibility is to prioritize the kids' emotional health.\n\nThen, the funeral was on a school day with tests. Missing school could have academic consequences. The kids might have felt pressured to attend even if they didn't want to. The author respected the kids' wishes, which shows they are being considerate of their children's feelings.\n\nThe ex-MIL's reaction is understandable but maybe she didn't consider the children's emotional state. The author explained the situation, so they aren't being inconsiderate of the family. The key points are the children's age, their emotional state, their own wishes, and the practical aspect of school. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. They made a decision that prioritized their children's needs, which is the right thing to do. The answer should be B.\n"
