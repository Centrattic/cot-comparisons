Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about sending the kids to school instead of their grandfather's burial. The OP (original poster) is a parent who's divorced from the kids' other parent. The kids were already at the viewings on Friday and the wake on Saturday. The actual burial is on Monday, which is a school day with tests. The kids said they don't want to go, and the parent chose to send them to school. The grandmother is upset.\n\nFirst, the parent's main reason is the kids' well-being. They were already emotional from the previous days. Making them go to another event might be too much. The kids themselves don't want to go, which is another factor. The parent is respecting their children's feelings here. \n\nAlso, the parent is a single parent, and the ex isn't in a great relationship with the ex. The parent had a good relationship with the grandfather. But the kids might be overwhelmed. Forcing them to attend might cause more trauma. \n\nThe grandmother's reaction is understandable, but the parent is prioritizing the kids' emotional state. The parent explained the situation, so they aren't being inconsiderate. The kids are young, 6 and 9, so their understanding of death is different. They might have felt they said goodbye already.\n\nSo, the parent isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
