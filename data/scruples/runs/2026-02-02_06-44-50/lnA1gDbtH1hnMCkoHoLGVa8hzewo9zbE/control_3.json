Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about sending the kids to school instead of their grandfather's burial. The kids are 6 and 9. They already attended the viewings and the wake, which were on Friday and Saturday. The burial is on Monday, which is a school day, and the kids have tests. They don't want to go to the burial, so the author sends them to school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the kids' well-being. The kids had a hard time seeing their grandfather in the casket, and they were emotional at the wake. They might not be ready for the burial, especially after already going through the viewings. The author mentions that the children themselves decided not to go, so respecting their wishes seems important. Forcing them to attend might cause more trauma.\n\nThe ex-MIL is upset because the kids aren't attending. But the author explains that the kids felt they had already said goodbye. The author also has to balance the kids' needs versus the expectations of the ex's family. The ex and the author are divorced and on bad terms, so maybe there's some tension there. But the author loved the ex-FIL and was close to him.\n\nLegally, the author is the custodial parent (since they're the ones making the decision), so they have the right to make decisions about the kids' activities, including school attendance. The school tests are a factor here. Missing school might affect the kids' education, especially with tests. But is that a strong enough reason?\n\nEmotionally, the kids might be better off not attending the burial if they're not ready. The author is prioritizing their children's emotional state. The ex-MIL's upset reaction is understandable, but the kids' well-being is a parent's primary responsibility. However, cultural expectations might play a role here. In some cultures, attending a funeral is important, but the kids are very young. The author might need to consider the long-term effects on the kids versus the immediate family expectations.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the decision is based on the kids' wishes and their emotional state, then the author is acting in their children's best interest. The ex-MIL's upset is a consequence, but the author isn't obligated to force the kids to attend if they're not ready. So probably answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
