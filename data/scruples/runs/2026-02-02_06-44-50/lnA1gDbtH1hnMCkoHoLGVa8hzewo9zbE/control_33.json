Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The author's kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already attended two viewings and a wake, which were emotionally tough for them. The actual burial is on a Monday, and the kids had tests at school that day. They declined to go, so the mother sent them to school instead. The ex-MIL is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional well-being of the children. They're very young and had already been through a lot with the viewings and the wake. Forcing them to attend another event might add unnecessary trauma. The kids themselves expressed they were done saying goodbye, so respecting their wishes makes sense.\n\nSchool attendance is another factor. The tests are scheduled, and the burial is on a school day. The mother might have to balance between attending the funeral and keeping the kids in school. Since the kids were attending the earlier events, maybe missing the burial is a reasonable choice, especially if they're not in a state to handle more stress.\n\nLegal or moral obligations? Legally, the mother has custody, so she can make decisions for the kids. Morally, it's about what's best for the children. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable, but the mother's priority is her children's emotional health. The fact that the kids declined to attend shows they're not ready. The mother isn't forcing them; she's respecting their choice.\n\nAlso, the grandfather was a Veteran, but the burial is a smaller event with only the ex's family. The kids might not be essential there. The mother is prioritizing their academic responsibilities and emotional state over attending a burial that the kids themselves don't want to be part of.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at the intent and the well-being of the children. The mother's actions seem to be in the kids' best interest. So, the answer is B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
