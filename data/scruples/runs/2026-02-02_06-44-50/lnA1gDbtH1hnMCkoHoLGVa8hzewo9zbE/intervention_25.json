Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. Let's start by looking at the situation they described.\n\nThe kids are 6 and 9 years old. Their grandfather passed away, and they had already attended the viewings and wake on Friday and Saturday. Those events were tough for them because they had to see him in the casket, and they were emotional. Now, the burial is on a Monday, and the kids have tests at school. The author asked them if they wanted to go, and they declined, saying they'd already said goodbye. The ex-MIL is upset that the kids aren't going to the burial.\n\nFirst, I should consider the age of the children. At 6 and 9, they might not fully understand the significance of a burial compared to the earlier services. They had a hard time with the viewings, which involved seeing the body. The burial might be a more solemn event, but maybe they're not ready for it. The author is respecting their wishes, which is important for a child's emotional well-being. Forcing them to attend could cause more distress, especially if they don't want to go after the previous experiences.\n\nThen there's the fact that the burial is on a school day, and the kids have tests. The author is prioritizing their education, which is a common practice. Parents often have to balance family obligations with school and work, and in this case, the children have specific academic commitments. The author is also considering the children's own feelings, which shows empathy and understanding.\n\nThe ex-MIL is upset, but the author explains that the kids felt they'd already said goodbye. The ex-MIL's reaction seems to be based on her own expectations rather than the children's emotional state. While it's natural to want family members at the burial, especially grandchildren, the kids' well-being and their expressed desires should be a priority here. The author isn't forcing them, so it's respecting the children's autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family traditions and being present for such a significant event are important. However, the children have already been to multiple services, and the burial is a follow-up. Given their young age and the fact that they've already experienced the viewings and wake, maybe the burial is less necessary for them. The author is also in a divorced situation with the ex, which might complicate things further, but the main issue here is about the kids' welfare.\n\nI think the key points are the children's age, their emotional state, and their expressed desire not to attend. The author is making a decision that's in the best interest of the kids, considering their school schedule and their feelings. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable but the author isn't wrong for putting the children's needs first. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
