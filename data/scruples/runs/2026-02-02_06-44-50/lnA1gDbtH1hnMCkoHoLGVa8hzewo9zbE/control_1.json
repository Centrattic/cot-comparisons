Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they sent their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial. The kids had already attended the viewings and were upset. The ex-MIL is upset they didn't go to the burial.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: The kids are young (6 and 9), they've already been to the viewings and wake, which were emotional for them. They didn't want to go to the burial, so the parent chose not to force them. The parent is respecting the kids' wishes and also considering their school commitments, especially tests. The funeral was on a Monday, which is a school day. \n\nThe ex-MIL is upset, but the author explains the kids' feelings and the school tests. The parent is prioritizing the children's emotional well-being and their education. The kids had already said goodbye, so maybe the parent thinks they've honored their grandfather enough. There's a divorce involved, and the parent is trying to make the best decision without involving the ex, which might complicate things.\n\nPossible angles: Is the parent wrong for not making the kids attend? Well, forcing kids to attend a burial when they're emotional and have school might be stressful. The parent is listening to the kids' needs. On the other hand, some might argue that attending the burial is a family tradition or respect for the deceased. But the kids themselves didn't want to go, so the parent respected their choice. \n\nAlso, the parent had already taken them to the viewings, which were impactful. Maybe the burial is a smaller event with family. The parent is balancing their children's current emotional state and academic responsibilities. The parent's explanation to the ex-MIL was clear, but the ex-MIL's reaction shows there's a cultural or family expectation conflict. However, the parent is acting in the kids' best interest. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The parent made a compassionate choice based on the children's feelings and practical considerations.\n"
