Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're an a**hole for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. They already took the kids to the viewings and wake on Friday and Saturday, which were tough for the kids. Now the burial is on Monday, which is a school day, and the kids have tests. The kids themselves don't want to go, saying they already said goodbye. The ex-MIL is upset.\n\nSo, the key points here: the kids are young (6 and 9), they've already experienced the services and found them hard. The burial is on a school day with important tests. The kids don't want to go. The parent had to explain that the kids were at school, and the ex-MIL was upset. \n\nI think the parent is not in the wrong. They prioritized the kids' emotional well-being and school commitments. The kids had already participated in the earlier services, and forcing them to go to another event might have been too much, especially if they didn't feel the need to. The parent respected the kids' wishes, which is important for their mental health. The ex-MIL's upset is unfortunate, but the parent's decision was in the children's best interest. So answer B.\n"
