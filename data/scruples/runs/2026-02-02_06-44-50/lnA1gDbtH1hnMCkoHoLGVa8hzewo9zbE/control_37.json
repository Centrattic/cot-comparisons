Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The kids are 6 and 9 years old. Their grandfather on the father's side passed away. The parents are divorced, but the mother loved the ex-father-in-law. The kids attended the viewings on Friday and the wake on Saturday. The burial is on Monday, which is a school day, and the kids have tests. The kids themselves don't want to go to the burial, saying they've already said goodbye. The ex-mother-in-law is upset that the kids aren't attending.\n\nSo, the main points here are the children's well-being, their wishes, and the mother's decision to send them to school instead. The mother is balancing her own grief with the children's emotional state and their school responsibilities. The ex-MIL is upset, but the mother's priority is the kids' comfort and their school commitments.\n\nI need to consider if the mother's decision is justified. The kids are young and already had a hard time with the viewings and wake. Forcing them to attend another event might cause more trauma. The mother is respecting their wishes, which is important for their emotional health. Also, the burial is on a school day with tests, so there's an educational aspect to consider. The mother is making a choice that prioritizes the children's current emotional state over attending the burial, which might be seen as a responsible decision.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex-MIL is upset, and there's a cultural or family expectation that the kids should attend. But the mother is the one making the decision, and she's in a position where she has to balance different factors. The kids themselves don't want to go, so forcing them against their will could be traumatic. The mother might be right in not pushing them further after they've already said goodbye.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because she's considering the children's emotional well-being and respecting their decision, especially given their age and the circumstances.\n"
