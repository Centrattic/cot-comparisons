Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The situation is that the author's ex-FIL died, and there's a burial happening on a Monday. The kids are 6 and 9. They already went to the viewings on Friday and the wake on Saturday. The author had to take them to those, and the kids were really upset. Now, the burial is on a Monday, and the kids are at school. The author let them stay because they said they already said goodbye. The ex-MIL is upset about this.\n\nSo, the question is whether sending the kids to school instead of the burial is wrong. The author is asking if they're an a**hole for not making the kids go to the burial. \n\nFirst, the kids are young. They had a hard time with the viewings and the wake. The author explained that the kids themselves didn't want to go, so they sent them to school. The ex-MIL is upset, but the kids are the ones making the decision here. Should the author have forced them to go even if they didn't want to? \n\nWell, considering the children's well-being is a priority. If the kids are already traumatized by the viewings and the wake, making them attend the burial might be too much. Also, the burial is on a Monday, which is a school day. The kids have tests. Forcing them to miss school for the burial might affect their education. \n\nBut on the other hand, the ex-MIL is upset because they didn't attend. The author's ex-MIL might feel that the kids should be there for the final respects. However, the author's main responsibility is to the children's emotional and educational needs. The kids themselves expressed that they already said goodbye, so the author respected their wishes. \n\nIn many cases, allowing children to process grief on their own terms is important. Forcing them to attend might cause more distress. The author did take them to the earlier services, which is a significant part of the mourning process. The burial is a smaller, more family-centered event, and the kids are young. \n\nSo, I think the author is not in the wrong. They prioritized the children's emotional state and their education, and followed the kids' own wishes. The ex-MIL's reaction is part of the family conflict, but the author's actions seem reasonable. So the answer should be B.\n"
