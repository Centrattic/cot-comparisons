Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the right thing here. The situation is that they sent their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial. The kids are 6 and 9, so pretty young. The grandfather died, and they had viewings on Friday and a wake on Saturday. The burial was on Monday, which is a school day with tests.\n\nThe author mentions that the kids were already at the viewings and were very emotional. They had a hard time seeing their grandfather in the casket. The kids themselves said they didn't want to go to the burial, so the parent sent them to school. The ex-mother-in-law was upset about this decision.\n\nSo, the key points here are the well-being of the children. The parent had to balance between the kids' emotional state and the expectations of the ex-MIL. The kids were already traumatized by the viewings and were struggling emotionally. Forcing them to attend another service might have been too much, especially since they felt they had already said goodbye. The parent was respecting the children's feelings here.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex-MIL might feel that it's important for the kids to attend the burial as part of the grieving process and family traditions. But considering the kids' age and their emotional state, it's a tough call. The parent had to make a decision that prioritized the immediate emotional needs of the children. \n\nI think the parent made the right choice. It's important to let children process grief in their own way, especially when they're young. Forcing them to attend might have caused more distress. The parent was following the kids' lead, which shows empathy towards their feelings. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable, but the parent's decision was in the best interest of the children. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
