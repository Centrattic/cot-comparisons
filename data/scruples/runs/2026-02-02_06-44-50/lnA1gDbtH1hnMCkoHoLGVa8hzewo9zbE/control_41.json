Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe kids are 6 and 9 years old. Their grandfather passed away, and they had a close relationship. The parents are divorced, and the author is the parent who took the kids to the viewings on Friday and the wake on Saturday. The kids were really upset during those events. Now, the burial is on Monday, which is a school day, and the kids have tests. The author asked if they wanted to go, and they declined, saying they already said goodbye. The author sent them to school, and the ex-MIL is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I should consider the age of the children. At 6 and 9, they are very young, and attending viewings and wakes can be traumatic. The kids were already emotional after the previous events. The author is prioritizing the children's well-being and their school commitments, especially tests. The ex-MIL seems to expect the kids to attend the burial, but the author respects the kids' wishes.\n\nIs the author wrong for not forcing the kids to attend? Well, forcing children to attend a funeral when they're not emotionally ready could be harmful. The parents have a responsibility to consider their children's emotional health. The kids expressed they didn't want to go after the previous events, so the author is respecting their autonomy, which is important.\n\nAlso, the burial is on a school day. The school is a structured environment, and missing school could have academic consequences. The author might be balancing the child's education and emotional needs. The ex-MIL's reaction is hurtful, but the author isn't obligated to accommodate the ex-MIL's expectations if it's not in the children's best interest.\n\nHowever, some might argue that attending a family member's funeral is important for cultural or family reasons. But in this case, the kids already had their chance to say goodbye, and the burial is a more formal event. The children's comfort and their own choices should be respected. There's no indication that the author is neglecting the children's needs; instead, they are making a decision that prioritizes their well-being.\n\nSo, considering all aspects, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a compassionate decision based on the children's emotional state and academic schedule. The answer should be B.\n"
