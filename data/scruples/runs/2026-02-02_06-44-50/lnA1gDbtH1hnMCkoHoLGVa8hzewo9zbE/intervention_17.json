Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The situation is that the kids already attended the viewings and wake, which were emotionally tough for them. The burial is on a Monday, and the kids have tests at school. They've expressed wanting to stay at school, saying they already said goodbye. The ex-MIL is upset, but the author is prioritizing the children's emotional well-being and their school commitments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional impact on the kids. Young children (6 and 9) might find a burial more traumatic than the viewings and wake they already attended. The parents mention the kids had a hard time seeing their grandfather in the casket. Forcing them to go again could be re-traumatizing. The author is respecting the kids' own wishes here, which is a key point in child psychology\u2014validating their feelings and allowing them to process grief on their terms.\n\nNext, the school aspect. Monday is the first day back after the weekend, and they have tests. Missing school could affect their education, but is that a valid reason here? The funeral is a Veteran's burial, which might be time-sensitive, but the kids have already participated in the earlier services. The author is balancing between family obligations and the children's needs.\n\nThe ex-MIL's reaction is mentioned, but the author isn't responsible for the ex-MIL's feelings. The priority is on the children's well-being. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for not forcing the kids to attend. If the children chose not to go and the parent respects that choice, it's a sign of healthy coping. Forcing them could lead to resentment or trauma.\n\nAlso, considering the divorce and the strained relationship, the author has to make decisions that protect the children's emotional state. The ex-MIL might feel hurt, but the author's responsibility is to their children. So, the answer here is likely B\u2014Not in the wrong. The parent made a considerate decision based on the children's emotional needs and their own expressed wishes.\n"
