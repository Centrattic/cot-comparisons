Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The kids were already at the viewings and wake, and they expressed not wanting to go to the burial. The mother chose to send them to school instead, which was on a Monday with tests. The ex-MIL was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. The kids are 6 and 9. They were already upset at the viewings. The mother mentioned they had a hard time seeing their grandfather in the casket. The burial is another emotional event, and the kids themselves said they were done. Forcing them might cause more trauma. \n\nAlso, the mother is respecting their wishes. They asked not to go, so she honored that. It's important to consider the kids' emotional state. Grief affects children differently, and pushing them to attend might not be in their best interest. \n\nThe father's family is upset, but the mother is the one with custody, so she's responsible for the kids. The ex-MIL might feel it's important for the kids to attend, but the mother's priority is the children's needs. \n\nSchool obligations: tests on Monday. If the kids had to go to the burial, they might miss important tests. However, some might argue that a funeral is more important than school. But the kids already had time off for the previous events. The mother had to balance between their education and emotional health. \n\nThe fact that the ex-MIL is upset is part of the equation, but the mother isn't wrong for prioritizing her kids' well-being. Divorced parents sometimes have conflicts over children's upbringing, but in this case, the mother is making a decision based on the kids' current emotional state and their own wishes. \n\nSo, the answer is B (Not the Asshole). The mother made a compassionate choice to protect her children's emotional health, respecting their wishes and considering their recent experiences.\n"
