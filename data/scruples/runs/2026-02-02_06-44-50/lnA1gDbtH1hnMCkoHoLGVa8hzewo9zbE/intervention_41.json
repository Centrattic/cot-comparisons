Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not making their kids attend their grandfather's burial. The author's kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already went to the viewings on Friday and the wake on Saturday, which were emotionally tough for them. The burial is on Monday, and the kids have tests at school. They didn't want to go, so the author sent them to school instead. The ex-MIL is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. The kids were already distressed by seeing their grandfather in the casket. Making them attend another event might be too much for them emotionally. Their age is a factor here; 6 and 9 might not have the emotional resilience to handle multiple funerals. The author prioritized their kids' emotional state, which is important. \n\nNext, the author explained the situation to the ex-MIL, but she was still upset. The author might feel guilty because the ex-MIL expected the kids to be there. However, the kids themselves expressed that they felt they had already said goodbye. The author should respect their children's wishes, especially after the emotional toll the previous events had on them.\n\nSchool tests on Monday could be another consideration. The author might have chosen school over the burial for practical reasons too, but the main reason seems to be the kids' emotional state. \n\nThe ex's family is attending, but the kids were not forced to go. The author isn't being selfish; they're making a decision based on their children's needs. The ex-MIL's reaction is valid in terms of family expectations, but the children's well-being should take precedence, especially with their young age and the trauma they've already experienced.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. Forcing the kids to go might have been worse for their mental health. The author made a compassionate choice. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
