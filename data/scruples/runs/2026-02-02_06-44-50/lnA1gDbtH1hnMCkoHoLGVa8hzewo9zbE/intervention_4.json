Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forcing their kids to attend their grandfather's burial. The author's kids were already at the viewings and wake, and the burial is on a Monday with school tests. The kids themselves didn't want to go again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The kids are 6 and 9, which is a young age. They've already been through the viewings and wake, which were emotionally tough for them. The author mentions they had a hard time seeing their grandfather in the casket. The burial is a smaller event with just a few family members. The kids have already expressed they felt they said goodbye, and the author respected their wishes by sending them to school. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex-MIL is upset that the kids didn't attend the burial. But the author's decision was based on the kids' emotional well-being and their own wishes. The author is also a parent who's prioritizing the children's comfort, especially after a traumatic experience. \n\nForcing children to attend a funeral they're not ready for could cause more harm. The parent is not obligated to override the child's wishes in this case. The author explained the situation to the ex-MIL, even though she was upset. \n\nSo, the author is acting in the best interest of their children. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
