Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The situation involves a divorce, children of different ages (6 and 9), and a family conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The kids already attended the viewings and the wake, which were emotionally tough for them. The burial is on a Monday, which is a school day, and the kids have tests. They themselves refused to go to the burial, saying they already said goodbye. The ex-MIL is upset because the kids aren't attending.\n\nThe main question is about the author's decision to send them to school instead. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the answer might depend on various factors. \n\nOn one hand, the grandfather was important to the family, and attending the burial could be a way to honor him. Missing school for a family event might be justified, especially if it's a significant event. However, the kids were already emotionally affected by attending the earlier events. Forcing them to go to the burial could cause more distress. Also, school has tests, so there's an academic consideration. \n\nThe kids themselves expressed that they didn't want to go. If they felt they had already said goodbye, respecting their wishes might be important. The author is prioritizing the children's emotional well-being and their school obligations. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that attending the burial is a family responsibility, especially for a close family member. The ex-MIL's reaction adds pressure, suggesting that she feels the children should be there. However, the author is the parent, and they have the final say in what's best for their kids. \n\nLegal custody and visitation rights aren't mentioned, but since the kids are with the author, they make the decisions. The author might not want to push the kids through another emotional event, especially if it's their first experience with death. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's decision seems to be in the best interest of the children's emotional state. The author isn't forcing them to attend, respecting their wishes, and balancing school. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable, but the parent's role is to protect the children's well-being. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
