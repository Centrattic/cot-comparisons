Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The kids are 6 and 9 years old. Their grandfather on the father's side passed away. The parents are divorced, and the ex-spouse isn't on the best terms with the author. The grandfather was a Veteran, so the burial process took longer. The kids already attended the viewings and the wake, which were emotional and tough for them. The actual burial is on a Monday, and the kids have tests at school. They said they didn't want to go to the burial, so the author sent them to school. The ex-mother-in-law is upset about this.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole for not making the kids go. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the key points. The kids have already attended part of the services, which were stressful. They're young and dealing with their first family death. The burial is on a school day with exams. The kids themselves don't want to attend, which the parent respected. The ex-MIL is upset, but the author is prioritizing the children's well-being and their wishes.\n\nFrom a child's perspective, forcing them to attend after they've expressed not wanting to might cause more distress. The parent is respecting the child's emotional state, which is important. Also, the school day is a factor, but maybe the parent could have discussed with the school to get an exception? However, the kids did attend the earlier events, which was significant.\n\nThe ex-MIL's upset is more about her expectations vs. the parent's decision. The author isn't in a close relationship with the ex-spouse, so maybe the expectations aren't as strong. The parent's main responsibility is to the children's emotional needs here. So, I think the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
