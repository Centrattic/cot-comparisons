Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of attending their grandfather's burial. The situation involves a divorced parent, a recent death, and children's emotional well-being.\n\nFirst, the kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already attended the viewings and were emotionally affected. The author made the decision based on the children's wishes and their school tests. The ex-MIL is upset, but the kids said they were okay with just saying goodbye earlier.\n\nI need to consider child development here. Young children might not be able to handle the stress and trauma of another funeral event. The author respected the kids' feelings, which is important. Also, school tests are scheduled, but is that a valid reason? Maybe not the main concern, but part of the decision.\n\nThe author wasn't forcing the kids to attend; they asked and the kids declined. That seems reasonable. The ex-MIL's upset reaction comes from her own expectations, but the children's needs should come first. Forcing children to attend might cause more trauma. So the author made a decision based on the children's emotional state. That's probably the right call. So the answer is B.\n"
