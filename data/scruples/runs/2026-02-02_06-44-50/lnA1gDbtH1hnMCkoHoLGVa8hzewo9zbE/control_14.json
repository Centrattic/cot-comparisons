Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who sent their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already attended two viewings, which were traumatic for them. They were emotional and had a hard time seeing their grandfather in a casket. The burial is on a Monday, and they have tests at school. They themselves didn't want to go to the burial, saying they had already said goodbye. The mom decided to send them to school instead. The ex-MIL is upset and thinks they should have attended.\n\nNow, the key points here. The kids have already been through the viewings and the wake, which were difficult. The burial is a more formal event, and the kids didn't express a desire to attend. The mother is prioritizing their emotional well-being by respecting their wishes, especially considering the tests. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable, but the kids' needs might be more important here.\n\nIn such cases, it's common to consider the child's emotional state. Forcing them to attend a burial might re-traumatize them. The mother is making a decision based on the children's expressed feelings and their well-being. The ex-MIL's expectations might stem from her own grief and cultural or family traditions, but the children's mental health is a priority. \n\nSo, the mother isn't in the wrong. She's acting in her children's best interest, respecting their wishes and their academic schedule. The answer should be B.\n"
