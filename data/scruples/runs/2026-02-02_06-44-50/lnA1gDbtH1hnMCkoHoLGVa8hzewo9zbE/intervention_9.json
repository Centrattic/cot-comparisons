Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for sending their children to school instead of attending their grandfather's burial. The situation involves a divorced parent, so the children's father is the one who's part of the burial, but the mother (the author) is making the decision here.\n\nFirst, the grandfather died on March 1, and the funeral and burial happened over a few days. The kids missed school on Friday for viewings and the wake on Saturday. Now, the burial is on Monday, which is a school day, and the children have tests. The author asked if they wanted to go, and both declined. The ex-MIL is upset because the kids aren't attending the burial.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not making her kids attend. Let me consider the factors. The kids are 6 and 9, very young. They already had a hard time with the viewings and the wake. The mother is respecting their wishes, which is important. Forcing children to attend a burial might not be appropriate if they're not ready or if it's going to be traumatic. Also, school is important, especially with tests. \n\nOn the other hand, family expectations might be that all relatives attend the burial. The ex-MIL is upset, so there's a cultural or family norm being considered. But the mother is prioritizing her children's emotional well-being and their school commitments. The kids themselves felt they had said goodbye, which is a valid consideration. \n\nI think the key points are the children's age, their emotional state, and their expressed desire not to go. The mother isn't being selfish; she's listening to her kids and considering the school tests. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable, but the mother's decision seems reasonable. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
