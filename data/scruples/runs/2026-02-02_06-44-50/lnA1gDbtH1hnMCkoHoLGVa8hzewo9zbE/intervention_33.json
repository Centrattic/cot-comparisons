Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not taking their kids to the grandfather's burial. The situation involves a divorce, a difficult time for the kids, and the ex's mom being upset.\n\nFirst, the key points: The kids were already at the viewings and the wake, which were on Friday and Saturday. They found the experience tough, especially seeing their grandfather in a casket. The burial is on a Monday, which is a school day, and the kids have tests. They choose not to go, saying they've already said goodbye. The mother sends them to school, and the ex-MIL is upset about it.\n\nSo, the main question is whether sending the kids to school instead of the burial is wrong. The author argues that the kids were already present for the viewings, had a hard time, and are now focused on their tests. The ex-MIL wants them to attend the burial, but the kids don't want to.\n\nI need to consider the children's well-being. The kids are 6 and 9, young, and dealing with their first major family loss. The mother is prioritizing their emotional needs by respecting their decision not to attend another event. The burial is a formal event with military honors, which might be even more stressful for them. The tests on Monday might be a factor, but maybe not the main one. The ex-MIL is upset, but the mother's priority is her children's comfort and their expressed wishes.\n\nForcing kids into an emotional situation they're not ready for could be harmful. The mother is allowing them to process the grief at their own pace. The ex-MIL's upset could be about cultural or family expectations, but the mother's choice is about the kids' well-being. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
