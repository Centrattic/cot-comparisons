Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The author explains that the kids were already at the viewings and the wake, which were emotionally tough for them. The kids didn't want to go to the burial, especially since they have tests on a Monday. The ex-MIL is upset, but the author prioritized the children's well-being and their school obligations.\n\nFirst, the kids are 6 and 9 years old. They've experienced multiple stages of the funeral process already. The author mentions they had a hard time seeing their grandfather in the casket, and the weekend was difficult. At that age, their emotional capacity is limited, and forcing them to attend another event might be traumatic. The children themselves expressed not wanting to go, so respecting their wishes seems important.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of their education. The author is sending them to school for tests on a Monday. Missing school again might not be in their best interest. The author isn't forcing the kids to go; they made their own decision. The author is respecting the kids' feelings and choices here.\n\nThe ex-MIL's reaction is part of the situation, but the author can't control how others feel. The key here is the children's well-being versus the expectations of the ex-MIL. Since the kids have already participated in the viewings and wake, and they've chosen not to attend the burial, the author is acting in their children's best interest. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
