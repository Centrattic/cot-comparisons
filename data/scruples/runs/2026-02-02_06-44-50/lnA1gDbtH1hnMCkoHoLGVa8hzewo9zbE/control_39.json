Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about whether to take their kids to the grandfather's burial. The kids are 6 and 9 years old. The grandfather passed away, and there were viewings on Friday and a wake on Saturday. The kids attended those, which were emotionally tough for them. Now the burial is on Monday, which is a school day, and the kids have tests. The parents are divorced, and the author is the parent who has custody? Or maybe they share custody? Not sure.\n\nThe key points here are the children's well-being. The kids already attended the viewings and the wake, which were hard for them. They're young and might not fully understand the burial process. The author decided to send them to school instead of the burial because they said they already said goodbye. The ex-MIL is upset, but the author is prioritizing the children's emotional state and their school obligations.\n\nLegally, the parent making the decision has the right to prioritize the children's needs, especially their education and emotional well-being. Forcing children to attend a burial when they're not ready or when it's causing them distress might not be in their best interest. Also, the burial is on a school day with tests, so academic responsibilities are a factor. The ex-MIL's feelings are important, but the parent's primary responsibility is to the children. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they considered the kids' emotional state and practical matters. They didn't force the children to go against their will. The answer should be B.\n"
