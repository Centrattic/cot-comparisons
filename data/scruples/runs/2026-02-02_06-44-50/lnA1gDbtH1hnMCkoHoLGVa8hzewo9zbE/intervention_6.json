Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The situation involves a divorce, and the kids are young (6 and 9). The grandfather died, and the kids already attended viewings and a wake, which were emotionally tough for them. Now, the burial is on a Monday, and the kids have tests at school. The author decided to send them to school instead, respecting their wishes. The ex-MIL is upset because the kids aren't attending the burial.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. At 6 and 9, they might not fully understand the significance of a burial compared to the earlier services. The author mentions that the kids were already traumatized by seeing their grandfather in the casket. Forcing them to go to the burial might cause more distress. The kids themselves said they wanted to go to school, so the author respected their choice. \n\nAlso, the author explains that the kids had already participated in the viewings and wake, which are major parts of the funeral process. The burial might be more for the family members to say their final goodbyes. Since the author's ex-husband and ex-MIL are attending, maybe the kids's presence isn't as crucial there. Plus, the kids have school obligations, and the author is prioritizing their well-being and their own needs. \n\nThe ex-MIL's upset reaction is understandable but the author had to make a decision based on the kids' emotional state. The author wasn't forcing the kids to go; they made a choice based on the children's feelings. So, considering all these factors, it seems like the author made a compassionate choice. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
