Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The situation involves a divorce, so there might be some family tension.\n\nThe kids are 6 and 9, pretty young. They already attended viewings and a wake, which were emotional. The burial is on a Monday, and they have school tests. The author asked the kids if they wanted to go, and they declined, feeling they said goodbye already. The ex-MIL is upset, but the author prioritized the kids' well-being and their school commitments.\n\nFirst, the kids' emotional state is a key factor. They were already traumatized by seeing their grandfather in a casket. Making them go to another service might add more stress. The author respected the kids' wishes, which is important for their autonomy, even at a young age.\n\nSchool tests on a Monday are significant. Missing school could affect their education, but the author already took them out for the viewings and wake. The burial is a smaller event with just family, so maybe it's less critical for the kids to attend.\n\nThe ex-MIL's upset reaction is part of the family dynamics. But the author isn't obligated to satisfy the ex's family expectations. The priority here seems to be the children's emotional health. \n\nIn terms of cultural or family expectations, some might say attending a burial is important. But the author considered the kids' feelings and their own well-being. It's a balance between respecting family traditions and protecting children from added trauma.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a compassionate decision based on the kids' needs. The answer should be B.\n"
