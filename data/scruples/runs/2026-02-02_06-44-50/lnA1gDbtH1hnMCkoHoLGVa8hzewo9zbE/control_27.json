Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the main question is about whether sending the kids to school instead of their grandfather's burial makes them an asshole.\n\nFirst, the facts. The kids are 6 and 9 years old. Their grandfather passed away on March 1st. The funeral events were Friday the 8th and Saturday the 9th. The kids went to those viewings and wake, which they found very emotional. Now, the burial is on Monday, March 11th, which is a school day. The kids have tests, and they themselves said they already said goodbye, so the author sends them to school. The ex-MIL is upset because the kids aren't attending the burial.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that the kids have already been to the viewings, are emotionally affected, and now they don't want to go to the burial. The author respects their wishes. The ex-MIL is upset because she expected the kids to be there.\n\nNow, considering the children's well-being. The kids are very young and have already attended the viewings and wake, which were hard for them. Forcing them to go to another event, especially a burial, might cause more trauma. The child psychologist might say that respecting a child's emotional needs is important. Also, the kids have tests, which are academic responsibilities. The author had to balance the kids' emotional health and their school obligations.\n\nThe ex-MIL's upset is understandable because she might think the kids should be present for the burial. But the author is the parent making the decision in the kids' best interest. The kids themselves don't want to go, so forcing them could be counterproductive. The author is not being disrespectful to the grandfather by sending the kids to school; they've already participated in the earlier services.\n\nLegally and ethically, parents have the right to make decisions for their children's well-being. The author isn't breaking any laws here. Culturally, there might be expectations about family attendance at funerals, but the kids' emotional state is a valid reason to prioritize their needs.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
