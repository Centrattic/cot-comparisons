Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already went to the viewings and the wake, which were on Friday and Saturday. The author mentioned that the kids had a hard time seeing their grandfather in the casket and were emotional. The burial is on Monday, which is a school day, and the kids have tests. They themselves said they didn't want to go, feeling they already said goodbye. The author sent them to school, and the ex-MIL is upset.\n\nSo, the main question is whether not forcing the kids to attend the burial makes the author an asshole. Let's consider the kids' well-being. They were already traumatized by seeing their grandfather's body. Making them go to another event might be too much for their age. The author respected the kids' feelings, which is important. Also, the school tests and the age-appropriateness of attending such a somber event play a role.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that attending the burial is a family tradition or a sign of respect. However, the kids didn't want to go, and the author explained their choice. The ex-MIL's upset reaction is understandable, but the priority should be the children's emotional state. Forcing them could cause more distress.\n\nI think the key points here are the children's emotional needs versus family expectations. Since the kids chose not to go and the author supported that decision, it seems like the right call. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
