Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe kids are 6 and 9 years old. They attended the viewings on Friday and the wake on Saturday. The burial is on Monday, which is a school day. The kids had tests and didn't want to go. The author decided to send them to school instead. The ex-MIL is upset because the kids aren't attending the burial.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. Young kids might find funerals stressful, especially if they've already been through the viewings and wake. The author mentions they had a hard time seeing their grandfather in a casket and were emotional. Forcing them to attend another event might be traumatic. The kids themselves said they didn't want to go, which is important. The author respected their wishes, which shows consideration for their children's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex-MIL is upset. But the author's responsibility is to the kids, not the ex-MIL's expectations. The kids had already said goodbye, so attending the burial might not add to the closure for them. Also, school is important, especially with tests. Missing school could have academic implications, but the author might have balanced the emotional needs versus the academic needs here.\n\nCultural and family expectations might play a role. In some cultures, attending the burial is a significant duty. But the author's decision was based on the children's emotional state and their own judgment. The kids weren't forced, and they felt they had already said goodbye. The author also explained the situation to the ex-MIL, which shows effort to communicate.\n\nIs the author wrong? I think not. Prioritizing the children's emotional well-being and respecting their wishes is key here. The author isn't making a selfish decision but one that's in the kids' best interest. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable, but the author isn't obligated to meet her expectations at the cost of the children's comfort.\n"
