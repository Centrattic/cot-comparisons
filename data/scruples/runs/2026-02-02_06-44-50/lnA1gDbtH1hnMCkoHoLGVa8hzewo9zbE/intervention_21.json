Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not making their kids attend their grandfather's burial. The author's kids are 6 and 9 years old. They missed school for the viewings and wake, which were on Friday and Saturday. The burial is on Monday, which is a school day, and the kids have tests. They didn't want to go, so the parent sent them to school instead. The ex-MIL is upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are the children's well-being, their emotional state, and the parent's decision to prioritize their education and their own comfort. The kids were already stressed by the viewings and the wake, which made them emotional. The author is a divorced parent, and the ex's family is upset, but the parent is following the kids' wishes.\n\nFrom a child's perspective, being forced to attend a funeral they're not ready for could cause more trauma. The parent respected their children's feelings, which is important. The grandfather was a Veteran, so the burial might be a formal event, but the kids already had their goodbyes. The parent didn't force them, which seems considerate. The ex-MIL's reaction might be hurt because of the cultural or familial expectations, but the parent's priority is their children's emotional health.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parent made a choice based on their kids' needs. While the ex-MIL might feel it's important for the kids to attend, the parent's decision to honor their children's wishes and avoid additional stress seems justified. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no cultural context I'm missing where attending the burial is expected regardless. However, the story doesn't mention that the grandfather wanted the kids there specifically. The main argument is about the kids' emotional state and their choice. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
