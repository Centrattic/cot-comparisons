Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of attending their grandfather's burial. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already attended two viewings, which were emotional for them. The burial is on a Monday, and they have tests at school. The kids themselves didn't want to go to the burial, saying they had already said goodbye. The ex-mother-in-law is upset because the kids aren't attending.\n\nThe author's main points are that the kids were already at the viewings, they were upset, and now they don't want to go to the burial. The parent chose not to force them, respecting their choice. The ex-MIL is upset, but the author thinks they did the right thing by prioritizing the kids' well-being and their school obligations.\n\nOn one hand, some might argue that attending the burial is a family tradition or that the kids should be present for the final farewell. But on the other hand, the kids were already traumatized by the viewings, and forcing them to attend might cause more distress. The parent respected their children's feelings, which is important for emotional development. Also, school is important, and missing tests could be a factor, but maybe that's secondary to the emotional aspect.\n\nI think the key points are the children's emotional state and their own wishes. The author made a choice based on what they thought was best for the kids, considering their age and the emotional impact. The ex-MIL's reaction is understandable but maybe not the parent's fault. So, the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong). The parent prioritized the children's well-being and their expressed wishes, which is a responsible decision.\n"
