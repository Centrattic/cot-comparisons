Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who sent their kids to school instead of to the grandfather's burial is in the wrong. The situation involves a divorced parent and ex-spouse's family. The kids are 6 and 9. The grandfather died after a long illness, and the family attended the viewings and wake, which were emotionally tough for the children. The burial is on a Monday when they have school tests. The kids themselves didn't want to go, so the parent sent them to school. The ex-MIL is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. The kids already attended the viewings and wake, which were hard for them. They were emotional and cried. The parent explained that the kids felt they'd already said goodbye. The parent is prioritizing their children's emotional health by not forcing them to attend the burial, especially if they're not ready. \n\nAlso, the practical aspect: the tests on Monday. Missing school could affect their academic progress, but the parent might balance this against the emotional impact. However, the ex-MIL is upset, thinking the kids should be there. But the parent is the one responsible for the kids and should prioritize their needs.\n\nLegal or ethical considerations: The parent has custody, so their decisions about the kids' schedule are their responsibility. The ex-MIL is upset, but the parent isn't obligated to comply with the other family's wishes if it's not in the kids' best interest. The children's own wishes are also considered here\u2014they said they didn't want to go. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say that attending the burial is important for closure, but given the kids' age and emotional state, it's reasonable to respect their choice. The parent is also considering their children's mental health, which is crucial. \n\nSo, the parent isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
