Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial. The situation involves a divorced parent, young children, and a family funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already attended the viewings and the wake, which were emotionally tough for them. The burial is on a Monday, and they have tests at school. The author respected the kids' decision not to attend the burial, as they felt they had already said goodbye. The ex-MIL is upset about this.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. The main factors to consider are the children's emotional well-being versus family expectations. The kids were already traumatized by seeing their grandfather in the casket. Forcing them to attend another event might cause more stress. Also, the parents are divorced and not on good terms, so the author might be prioritizing the children's wishes here.\n\nLegal and ethical standards usually support a parent's right to make decisions in their children's best interest, especially considering their mental health. The author didn't force the kids; they listened to the children's preferences. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable, but the parent's responsibility is to protect their children's well-being. \n\nSchool attendance is also a factor. The tests are important, but if the burial is during school hours, there might be logistical issues. However, the main point is the children's emotional state. \n\nIn similar cases, it's common for families to have differing opinions on funeral attendance for young kids. The key is whether the decision was made in the child's best interest. Here, the author did that. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
