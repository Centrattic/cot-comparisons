Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The situation is that the kids already went to the viewings and the wake, which were on Friday and Saturday. The actual burial is on a Monday, which is a school day, and the kids have tests. They didn't want to go, so the parent sent them to school. The ex-mother-in-law is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. The kids are 6 and 9 years old. They were already traumatized by seeing their grandfather in a casket during the viewings and had a hard time emotionally. Making them attend another event might add more stress. The parent seems to have prioritized the children's emotional state, which is a key factor in parenting decisions. \n\nNext, the parent's relationship with the ex-MIL. Since they are divorced and not on the best terms, the parent might not have the same influence or responsibility to involve the kids in all family events. The parent is respecting the children's wishes, which is important. Kids at that age might not fully understand the significance of a burial, so forcing them could be counterproductive. \n\nThe fact that the kids had already said their goodbyes at the earlier events might justify not making them attend the burial. The parent is also being honest with the ex-MIL, explaining the situation. The ex-MIL's reaction is understandable, but the parent's choice is based on the kids' needs. \n\nIn terms of cultural or family expectations, some might argue that attending a grandparent's burial is important. However, the parent is making a decision based on the children's current emotional capacity and their school responsibilities. The tests on Monday could be important, but maybe not as critical as the kids' mental health. \n\nThere's no indication that the parent is being negligent. They allowed the kids to attend the earlier events and acknowledged their feelings. The decision to let the kids stay in school is a compassionate one, considering their age and the circumstances. \n\nSo, the parent isn't in the wrong. They're making a judgment call to protect their children's well-being. The answer should be B.\n"
