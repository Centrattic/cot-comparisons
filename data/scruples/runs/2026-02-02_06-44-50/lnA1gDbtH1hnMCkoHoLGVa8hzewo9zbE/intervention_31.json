Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the parent who chose to send their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial is in the wrong. The parent's ex-mother-in-law is upset about it.\n\nFirst, the kids are only 6 and 9. They missed school on Friday for viewings, which were already tough for them. Now, the burial is on a Monday, and the kids have tests. They said they wanted to go to school instead. The parent respects their wishes. \n\nThe ex-MIL is upset, but the parent's responsibility is to the children. Forcing them to attend a burial after they've already seen their grandfather in the casket might be traumatic. The parent's decision prioritizes the kids' emotional well-being and their education. \n\nAlso, the parent and ex are divorced and not on good terms, but they were close to the grandfather. The funeral was delayed due to being a Veteran, which might have caused some tension. The parent had to make a call between the kids' needs and the family's expectations. \n\nI think the parent is not in the wrong because they considered the children's feelings and the practicalities of school. The kids had already participated in the earlier events, and the burial is a smaller family gathering. The parent shouldn't be forced to take the kids against their will, especially if it's not in the kids' best interest. So, answer B.\n"
