Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The situation is that the kids are 6 and 9, they already attended viewings and a wake, and they're having a hard time. The burial is on a Monday when they have school tests. The kids said they didn't want to go, so the parent sent them to school instead. The ex-mother-in-law is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's age and emotional state. They've already been through the viewings and a wake, which were tough. The kids expressed not wanting to go to the burial. Forcing them might cause more trauma. The parent is prioritizing the kids' well-being by respecting their wishes and their school obligations. \n\nThe parent isn't on the best terms with the ex, but they had a good relationship with the ex-FIL. The burial is a family event, but the children are the focus here. The parent made a choice that's in the best interest of the children, considering their age and emotional capacity. \n\nThe ex-MIL's reaction is understandable, but the parent isn't obligated to accommodate her expectations, especially when the children are the ones affected. The decision to send them to school was based on the kids' own feelings and practical considerations like tests. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They made a responsible decision based on their children's needs and well-being.\n"
