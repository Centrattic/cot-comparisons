He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband setting up his office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the author, who also works from home and handles most household chores and childcare.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband chose to work from the bedroom despite being offered the basement, which is quieter. His job is mostly conference calls, so he needs silence. But because he's in the bedroom, the author can't use the top floor, can't shower, do chores, etc. She works from home too and does most of the housework and childcare. She told him she can't guarantee silence if he stays in the bedroom, and he's upset she's not keeping the environment quiet, while she's upset he's not using the basement.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me analyze. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom, despite having an alternative, is the root issue. He prioritized the view over practicality, which leads to the author's hardships. The author is trying to set boundaries by saying she can't promise silence, which is reasonable because she manages the household and kids. The husband's job requires silence, but he's in a space where that's not feasible without cooperation from others, especially since there are kids. The author's role is handling the kids and chores, so if the office is in a high-traffic area, it's unrealistic to expect her to manage both her work and the household without interruptions.\n\nThe husband's argument is that he's the asshole for not being quiet, but he's the one who chose an inconvenient location. The author is not obligated to make his work environment perfect if he made a choice that complicates the household dynamics. The basement was a viable option, and he rejected it. So the problem lies in his decision, not her inability to provide silence in an already compromised setup. Therefore, the husband is more at fault here, and the author is justified in her stance. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
