He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband setting up his office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife. The wife suggested the basement for more space and silence, but he prefers the bedroom for the view. Now, she has to manage the kids and household chores around his work calls, which affects her own ability to do things like shower or take a nap.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom might be inconvenient, but the wife is also trying to balance work and household responsibilities. The key points are about mutual consideration and shared living space.\n\nThe husband is working from home, which is a valid need, but he's choosing a space that's shared (the bedroom), which is a private area. The wife is taking on most of the domestic duties and her own work. By choosing the bedroom, he's limiting her use of that space, which is essential for her daily routine. \n\nThe wife's response was to say she can't guarantee silence if he stays in the bedroom, which seems reasonable. She's not saying he can't work there, but she's setting boundaries. The husband is upset because he wants undisturbed work, but he also chose the location that causes the conflict. \n\nIs the wife in the wrong? Well, she did suggest the basement as an alternative, which would minimize disruption. By not choosing that option, the husband is creating a problem that affects her. The wife is trying to balance her responsibilities, and the husband's choice is making it harder. \n\nSo, maybe the husband is more at fault here for not considering the practical implications of his office location. The wife's reaction is about her need for space and flexibility, which is understandable given her workload. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong). But I need to make sure I didn't miss any details. The wife is not entirely avoiding responsibility; she's trying to manage a difficult situation. The husband's preference for the view over functionality adds to the problem. So, yes, B seems correct.\n"
