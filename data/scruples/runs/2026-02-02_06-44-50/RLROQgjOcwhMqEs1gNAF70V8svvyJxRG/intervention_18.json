He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband working from home in the bedroom, which causes disruptions for the wife and kids. \n\nFirst, the husband set up his office in the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion to use the basement. The basement is quieter, so he's choosing a location that's less practical. His job is mostly conference calls, so he needs silence, but when he's in the bedroom, the wife has to manage the kids and household tasks without using the top floor. She can't even take a shower or nap without disturbing him. She works from home too and handles most chores and childcare.\n\nThe wife's main point is that she can't promise silence in the bedroom, so she's pushing him to move to the basement. The husband argues she's the asshole for not being quiet, but she thinks he's the asshole for not using the basement. The user initially thinks the author (the wife) is in the wrong but is unsure.\n\nI need to assess who is at fault. The husband is the one who chose a less optimal location for his office despite being offered a better alternative. His decision impacts the wife's ability to manage the household and her work. The wife is setting boundaries to protect her own well-being and responsibilities. Since he's the one creating the conflict by not using the available basement space, the blame likely lies with him. Therefore, the author (wife) isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
