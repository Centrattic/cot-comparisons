He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about their husband setting up his office in the bedroom, leading to disruptions for the author.\n\nFirst, the husband works from home a few days a week and chose the bedroom over the basement despite the wife's suggestion. The basement would have been quieter. The wife is handling most of the housework, kids, and her own job, but the husband being in the bedroom limits her ability to do these things. She told him she can't guarantee silence there, so he's upset she's not keeping the bedroom quiet. She's frustrated he didn't take the basement option.\n\nThe key points are about shared space usage and compromise. The husband's choice affects the wife's daily life significantly. The wife tried to suggest an alternative (basement) which he rejected. Now, she's enforcing that if he's in the basement, there's no disruption. But since he's in the bedroom, she can't promise silence. The husband is upset about the noise, but the wife is upset about the lack of flexibility and the impact on her routine.\n\nIn a typical scenario, when someone works from home, it's reasonable to expect a setup that minimizes disruption for others. The husband chose a shared space (bedroom), which is a common area, while the basement is more isolated. The wife is in a tough spot because her responsibilities (kids, chores, her job) require her to use the top floor, which is now off-limits due to his calls. \n\nThe question is whether the wife is in the wrong for not keeping the bedroom quiet. But since the husband made the choice to work there, maybe the responsibility is on him to consider others. However, the wife did warn him about the noise issues if he stays in the bedroom. She's trying to manage her own workload and responsibilities. \n\nI think the husband might be at fault for not considering the practicality of the setup. However, the wife could have tried to negotiate further or set clearer boundaries. But given that she suggested the basement and he refused, her stance that she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom might be reasonable. So the answer might be B (she's not in the wrong).\n"
