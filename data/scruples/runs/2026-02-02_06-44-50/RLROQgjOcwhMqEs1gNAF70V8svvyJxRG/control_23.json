He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband setting up his home office in the bedroom, which causes disruptions for the wife.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The husband works from home a few days a week, chose the bedroom over the basement because he likes the view. The wife suggested the basement for fewer disturbances. His job is mostly conference calls, so the wife has to manage the kids and keep them from disturbing him, which restricts her movement in the house. She can't do chores, shower, etc., while he's on calls. She works from home too and handles most household tasks and kids. She told him she can't guarantee silence if he stays in the bedroom, so he thinks she's the asshole for not being quiet, while she thinks he's the asshole for not using the basement.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom the details, the husband made a choice that affects the wife's ability to function. The wife gave a reasonable alternative (basement), but he chose the bedroom. The problem arises because his choice leads to significant limitations for her. The wife is trying to balance her work and family responsibilities, but the husband's setup hampers her. \n\nTypically, in such situations, shared spaces like the bedroom and bathroom are important for both partners. Using the bedroom for an office when there's an alternative space (basement) available could be seen as selfish, especially when it causes others in the household (kids) to be restricted and affects the wife's ability to manage her tasks. The husband's preference for a better view seems less important compared to the practical impact on the wife and kids. \n\nThe wife's main issue is that she can't use her bathroom, do chores, etc., which are her responsibilities. The husband is in a position where he can control the environment by choosing where to set up. The wife's refusal to guarantee silence is reasonable because she can't control the kids or her own needs. \n\nIn most cases, shared spaces should be considered for both partners' well-being. The husband's choice to use the bedroom might be the root of the problem. Therefore, the husband might be more at fault here. So the author (the wife) isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
