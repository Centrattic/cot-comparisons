He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband setting up his office in the bedroom, which causes disruptions for the author (the wife). The husband works from home a few days a week, mostly on conference calls, and the wife feels that this setup is making it impossible for her to do chores, take a shower, or even nap because she has to keep the kids from disturbing him. She suggested the basement, which has more space and would be quieter, but he prefers the bedroom for the view. Now she's telling him she can't guarantee silence if he stays in the bedroom, and he's arguing she's the asshole for not being quiet, while she thinks he's the asshole for not moving to the basement.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but want to know my opinion. I need to determine if the author (the wife) is in the wrong here. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the husband chose to set up his office in the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion to use the basement. The basement is described as having adequate space and being more suitable for work with minimal disruptions. The husband's preference for the view seems to be a personal choice that leads to conflicts in their living space. The author is then forced to manage the household and childcare without being able to use the top floor, which impacts her ability to work and take care of household tasks. \n\nThe key points here are: \n1. The husband's choice of workspace is causing significant disruption to the wife's daily life and responsibilities.\n2. The wife is taking on most of the house chores and childcare, which is compounded by the husband's work setup.\n3. The wife is setting boundaries by saying that if he stays in the bedroom, she can't guarantee quiet, which is a reasonable response to protect her own needs and responsibilities.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, setting up a home office in a shared space like the bedroom without considering the impact on a spouse's ability to manage the household seems impractical. The husband's preference for the view is a minor inconvenience compared to the wife's challenges. The wife is trying to balance her own work and household duties, and the current setup is making it impossible. Her response to move the office to the basement seems logical and considerate of both their needs. If the husband refuses to compromise, then the responsibility for the disruption lies with him. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. She is advocating for her needs and the practicality of the situation, while the husband is prioritizing his personal preference over shared responsibilities. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
