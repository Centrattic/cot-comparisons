He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe husband set up his office in the bedroom despite being offered the basement for less disruption. His job is mostly conference calls, so he needs silence. The wife is handling the kids, chores, and also works from home. She's saying that having him in the bedroom restricts her from doing basic things like showering or taking a nap. She told him that if he stays in the basement, they won't disturb him, but if he stays in the bedroom, she can't guarantee silence. He's upset she isn't being quiet, and she thinks he's wrong for not moving to the basement.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author (the wife) is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The question is whether she's wrong.\n\nFirst, let me consider the situation. The husband chose the less practical option (bedroom over basement) for a better view. The wife is managing a lot\u2014work, kids, household tasks. By moving to the basement, the husband could avoid the noise issues. The wife is trying to set boundaries by saying she can't promise silence if he's in the bedroom. That seems reasonable because she's juggling multiple responsibilities.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and accommodation. The husband's work does require quiet, but so does the wife's work and personal time. The basement option was presented as a solution to avoid conflict. By not choosing the basement, the husband is creating a situation where his needs are prioritized over hers. The wife is asserting her right to functionality in her space, which is important when sharing a home, especially when both work from home.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is wrong, but I think the opposite. The wife is justified in her stance because she's trying to balance her responsibilities and needs. The husband is the one who chose a setup that causes more conflict. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
