He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom, which is where he works from home a few days a week. The wife suggested the basement, which is quieter, but he prefers the bedroom for the view. Now, she has to manage the kids and chores without disturbing him, which is making her life harder because she also works and does most of the housework. She told him she can't guarantee quiet if he's in the bedroom, but he's upset she's not keeping it quiet. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. Let me analyze. The key points here are about space usage and mutual respect. The husband chose to work in the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion of the basement. By setting up there, he's taking over a shared space that's also used for personal activities (like showering, napping). The wife is trying to manage her responsibilities (kids, chores, work) but can't because the bedroom is off-limits when he's on calls. \n\nOn the one hand, the husband's job requires him to be undisturbed for calls, which is reasonable. But on the other hand, the wife is also dealing with her work and household duties. The fact that the basement is available and quieter suggests that moving there would solve the problem. Since the husband chose the bedroom despite the wife's advice, maybe he's the one creating the conflict by prioritizing his preference over the shared space's practical use. \n\nThe author (wife) is trying to protect her own needs by not making promises she can't keep. By telling him upfront that she can't ensure silence in the bedroom, she's being honest. The husband's frustration seems to stem from not having his preferred setup, but maybe he's not considering the inconvenience it's causing her. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if he insisted on the bedroom despite the basement being available, then the problem is his choice. The wife is just asserting her right to use the space she needs. So perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. She's trying to balance both their needs but the husband's decision to set up in the bedroom is the root issue. Therefore, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
