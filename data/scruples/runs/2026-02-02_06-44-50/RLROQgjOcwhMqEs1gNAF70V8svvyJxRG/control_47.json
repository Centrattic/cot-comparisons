He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about their husband setting up his home office in the bedroom, leading to conflicts because he's on conference calls and the author feels restricted from using the top floor.\n\nSo, the husband wanted the bedroom because of the view, even though the basement is more suitable for less disruption. The author had suggested the basement, but he didn't take it. Now she's struggling with managing the kids and household tasks without being able to use the bathroom, shower, etc., when he's on calls.\n\nThe key points here are about compromise and mutual consideration. The husband had the option to choose the basement, which would have been less disruptive, but he chose the bedroom instead. The author is then held responsible for not keeping the top floor quiet, even though she had to manage kids and chores. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the husband made a choice that affects the author's daily life. The author is trying to balance her work and family responsibilities, and the husband's setup is interfering with that. The author isn't obligated to compromise further if the husband isn't willing to meet halfway. \n\nThe husband's argument that the author is being an asshole for not being quiet seems to ignore that he could have chosen a location that doesn't cause this conflict. The author is not at fault here because she made a reasonable suggestion (basement) and he didn't take it. Now she's trying to set boundaries, which is understandable given the impact on her life. \n\nSo, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
