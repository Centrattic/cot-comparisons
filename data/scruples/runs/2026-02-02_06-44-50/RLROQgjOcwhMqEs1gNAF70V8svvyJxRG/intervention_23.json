He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the wife) is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe husband started working from home part-time and set up his office in the bedroom. The wife suggested the basement, which has less disturbance. The husband prefers the bedroom because of the view. His job is mostly conference calls, so the wife has to keep the kids from disturbing him. This means the top floor is off-limits when he's on calls, and the wife can't do chores, shower, nap, etc. She also works from home and does most housework. She told him she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom but would if he was in the basement. The husband says she's the asshole, she says he is.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. I need to decide if she's wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, the husband's choice of where to work affects the wife's ability to function. The basement is available and quieter, but he chose the bedroom. The wife is managing the kids and work, and his setup limits her space. The problem seems to be his initial decision to set up in the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion. She's trying to balance both their needs, but his choice creates conflict. \n\nHe's not being flexible, while she's compromising by offering to keep quiet if he moves. He's not taking her needs into account by staying in the bedroom. The wife is trying to maintain her responsibilities and personal time but is hindered by his setup. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, he made the choice that caused the problem. She's trying to find a solution (moving to the basement) that would benefit both. He's unwilling, leading to the conflict. So, the author isn't in the wrong because she's advocating for her own needs and trying to find a solution. The husband is the one causing the issue by not moving to the basement. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
