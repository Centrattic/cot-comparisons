He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The story is about a husband setting up his office in the bedroom, leading to conflicts with the wife's ability to manage household duties and rest.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The husband chose to work from the bedroom despite the wife suggesting the basement, which would be quieter. His reasoning is the better view, but he's causing disruptions because of his job's conference calls. The wife is handling most of the housework, kids, and also works from home. She's unable to do basic tasks without disturbing him. The husband argues she's the asshole for not being quiet, while she thinks he's wrong for not moving to the basement.\n\nI need to evaluate who is at fault. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom, knowing it restricts the wife's space and responsibilities, seems problematic. The wife's suggestion was practical for minimizing disruption. The husband's preference for a better view over family needs might be seen as selfish, especially since there's adequate space in the basement. The wife is juggling work and chores, and his setup is hindering her ability to function.\n\nThe user thinks the author (wife) is in the wrong, but that seems unlikely. The key point is that the husband made a choice against the wife's suggestion, leading to her being unable to manage her tasks. The wife is not obligated to create a disturbance-free environment for him if he's in a space that's her primary living area. The husband's refusal to move to the basement is the root cause. Therefore, the husband is more at fault here. The wife's actions are a reaction to his decision, so she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
