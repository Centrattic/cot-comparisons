He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband working from home in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife who also works and takes care of the kids and chores.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband chose to set up his office in the bedroom despite the wife suggesting the basement, which is quieter. The wife feels that this limits her ability to do things like shower, use the bathroom, take a nap, etc., especially since she has a lot of responsibilities. The husband argues that she should keep it quiet, but the wife argues that he should have chosen the basement.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author (the wife) is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. I need to evaluate if her stance is justified. \n\nKey points: The husband has the option to work in the basement, which would minimize disruption. By choosing the bedroom, he's creating a situation where his work interferes with her daily life. The wife is handling a lot of childcare and chores while working from home. The husband's choice impacts her ability to manage her own work and household duties. \n\nThe wife is not making a demand but setting boundaries, saying she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom. The husband's insistence on being in the bedroom despite the consequences might be the issue here. The wife's actions are about respecting mutual space and responsibilities. \n\nSo, the husband's decision to prioritize his view and comfort over the wife's ability to function might make him the one in the wrong. The wife is trying to balance her own workload and family needs, which are valid. Therefore, the author (wife) isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
