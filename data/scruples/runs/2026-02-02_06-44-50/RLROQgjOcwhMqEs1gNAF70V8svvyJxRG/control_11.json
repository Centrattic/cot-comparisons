He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the husband setting up his home office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife who also works from home and handles most of the childcare and chores.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband chose the bedroom because of the view, even though the basement is available and quieter. The wife feels that by choosing the bedroom, he's making it harder for her to manage daily tasks and work. She told him she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, which he's upset about. The key issue here is the choice of workspace and its impact on each other's productivity and well-being.\n\nFrom the wife's perspective, she's taking on a lot: work, kids, chores. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom, which is a shared space, is creating conflicts. She's not the one making noise; the kids are. But she's the one managing the kids and the household. The husband is expecting silence, but the reality is that with kids, it's hard to maintain a quiet environment in a shared space like the bedroom.\n\nThe husband's argument is that he's working from home, so he needs a quiet space. But he's the one who chose a space that's not conducive to that. The basement is available, which would minimize disruptions. By choosing the bedroom, he's essentially forcing the wife to accommodate his needs, which might not be fair. The wife isn't being disruptive; she's just trying to manage her responsibilities. \n\nIn terms of fairness, both need to work from home and manage a household. The husband's decision to work in the bedroom is causing more problems. The wife is setting boundaries by saying she can't guarantee silence, which is reasonable. It's the husband who's not compromising by not using the basement. So, the wife isn't in the wrong. The husband is the one who made an impractical choice that affects the wife's ability to work and manage the home. Therefore, the answer should be B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
