He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style question is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the husband set up his office in their bedroom, leading to conflicts because the wife can't do her chores or take care of the kids without disturbing him. The wife suggested the basement, but he chose the bedroom for the view. The husband works mostly on conference calls, so the wife has to manage the kids and keep them away, limiting her own activities.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author (the wife) is in the wrong. The question is whether she's at fault for not keeping the husband undisturbed while he works from home. \n\nThe husband's choice to set up in the bedroom is a key point. He has the option of the basement but prefers the bedroom for the view. The wife has her own work and household responsibilities. Setting up in the basement would give him more privacy and reduce disruptions for the wife. However, he didn't choose that option. \n\nThe wife is taking on a significant amount of domestic and childcare work. By having the office in the bedroom, he's effectively limiting her ability to manage the home and take care of herself. The husband is expecting her to adjust her schedule and activities to accommodate his work environment, which might be unfair given that he had the alternative space available. \n\nThe core issue is about balancing work and household responsibilities. The wife isn't in the wrong if she's not the one who created the conflict. The husband made a choice that complicates her responsibilities. The wife is trying to communicate the impact of his decision on her, so she's not being unreasonable. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The husband's decision to work in the bedroom, despite the basement being available, is the root of the problem. The wife isn't at fault for not being able to meet his expectations if he's the one who set up the situation.\n"
