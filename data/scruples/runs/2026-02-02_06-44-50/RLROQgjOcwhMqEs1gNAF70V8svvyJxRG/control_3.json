He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband setting up his home office in the bedroom instead of the basement, leading to disruptions for the author.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The husband works from home part-time and chose the bedroom over the basement because of the view. His job is mostly conference calls, so when he's on calls, the wife has to keep the kids from disturbing him. This restricts her movement in the top floor, preventing her from doing chores, showering, napping, etc. She also works from home and does most of the housework and childcare. She suggested the basement, which is quieter, but he refused. Now she's being asked if she's in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed when he's in the bedroom.\n\nThe question is whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me break down the arguments. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom creates a conflict. He could have chosen the basement for less disruption but preferred the bedroom. The wife is managing work, chores, and kids, and his location is limiting her ability to do basic tasks. She made a reasonable suggestion (basement), which he ignored. Her response was to tell him she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom but would be quiet if he was in the basement. So, she's not making a promise she can't keep. \n\nIs she at fault? It seems like the husband is the one causing the problem by not choosing the better location. The wife's actions are a reaction to his choice. She's not disturbing him; she's just trying to live her life. The husband's decision to work in a shared space (bedroom) leads to the conflict. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
