He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband setting up his office in the bedroom, which causes disruptions for the wife. She suggested the basement for silence, but he prefers the bedroom view. The wife then restricts the top floor when he's on calls, affecting her ability to do chores, shower, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom leads to significant limitations for the wife. She works from home too and handles most household duties. By setting up in the bedroom, he's essentially reducing her available space and time for tasks. The wife's response is to not guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, which leads to her restrictions. \n\nThe key points are: the husband has a choice to work elsewhere (basement) but refuses. The wife is caught in the middle, handling work and kids, and the husband's setup is causing her stress. The question is whether the wife is wrong for not keeping him undisturbed. \n\nIf the husband made a poor choice (bedroom over basement) that affects others, then the wife isn't at fault for not accommodating that choice. She's being realistic about the impact on her life. So the husband's decision is the root problem. The wife is defending her needs by not promising silence, which is reasonable. Therefore, the author (wife) isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
