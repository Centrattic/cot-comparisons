He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong for not keeping her husband undisturbed while he works from home in their bedroom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband chose to set up his office in the bedroom, which is a shared space, even though the basement (a separate area) was suggested. He works mostly on conference calls, which require quiet. The wife is handling the kids, housework, and also works from home. She can't do basic tasks like showering or napping because he's in the bedroom. She told him she can't guarantee silence if he's there but can if he's in the basement. He's upset she's not keeping it quiet, while she's upset he didn't take the basement.\n\nHmm, so the main issue is where the office is set up. The wife was advised to suggest the basement because it's quieter, but he didn't take that option. If he's in the bedroom, a common area, then expecting complete silence might be unreasonable, especially with kids. But he chose that spot for the view. The wife is managing a lot and can't do her tasks because he's in the bedroom. \n\nIs the wife at fault? She tried to suggest the basement, which would solve the problem. But he didn't take it. So, maybe the husband is the one being unreasonable because he didn't take the practical option. However, the wife is now not keeping the room quiet, which he expects. But if he made the choice to be in a shared space, expecting silence might not be fair. \n\nThe wife is trying to balance work and family, and her needs are being impacted. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom complicates things. So the wife isn't necessarily wrong for not keeping him undisturbed because he's in a shared space. The problem started with his decision not to use the basement. Therefore, the husband is more in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
