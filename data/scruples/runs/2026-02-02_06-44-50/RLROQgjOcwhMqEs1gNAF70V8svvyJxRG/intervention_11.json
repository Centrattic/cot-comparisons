He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's husband working from home in the bedroom, causing disruptions because of conference calls. The author suggested the basement for his office but he chose the bedroom for better view. Now, the author feels burdened with keeping kids quiet and managing the household, and can't do basic tasks like showering or napping. The husband argues that the author isn't being quiet enough, while she thinks he should have chosen the basement.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom is causing conflict. The author suggested the basement, which has less disruption, but he refused. This leads to the author having to manage the household without being able to use the bathroom or shower freely. The husband's job requires conference calls, so he needs silence, but the author is also working from home and handling most of the housework and kids. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The husband is prioritizing his comfort (better view) over the author's ability to function. The author is trying to set boundaries by suggesting the basement, but he didn't agree. The husband's work setup is affecting the author's work and daily life. \n\nIn many cases, when both partners work from home, it's important to have separate spaces to minimize disruption. The husband's refusal to use the basement, despite it being a viable option, seems selfish. The author is trying to manage the household but is hindered by the husband's location. The husband's argument that the author isn't quiet is a bit harsh since she's managing the kids and chores. \n\nI think the main issue is the husband not considering the impact of his choice on the author. The author is justified in pointing out the problem and suggesting an alternative. The husband's insistence on the bedroom office without compromise might be the real issue here. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
