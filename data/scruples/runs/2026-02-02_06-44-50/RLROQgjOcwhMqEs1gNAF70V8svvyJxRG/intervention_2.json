He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband working from home in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife who also works and handles the kids and chores.\n\nFirst, the husband chose to set up his office in the bedroom despite being offered the basement. The basement is described as having less disruption, so he prefers the view. But his job involves a lot of conference calls, so when he's on calls, the wife has to keep the kids away, which limits her space and ability to do chores or rest.\n\nThe wife feels that he's making it impossible for her to manage her tasks and personal time. She's working from home too and taking care of the kids and housework. She told him that if he stays in the bedroom, she can't guarantee silence, but if he moved to the basement, they wouldn't bother him. He's upset that she's not keeping quiet during his calls, but she's frustrated he's blocking the bedroom.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author (the wife) is in the wrong, but wants to know. The question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the husband made the choice to work in the bedroom, which is their shared space. The wife is trying to explain the impact this has on her. If he wanted a dedicated office with minimal interruptions, the basement would be the better choice. By choosing the bedroom, he's affecting her ability to use that space. The wife isn't the one causing the disruption; the husband's location is the root cause. She's trying to manage her responsibilities and personal needs but is being restricted because of his setup. \n\nThe husband is expecting her to accommodate his work environment in a way that limits her own ability to function. The wife is not at fault for not keeping the bedroom undisturbed because it's a shared space. He chose the less optimal location despite being advised otherwise. Her stance that he's the one causing the problem by not moving is reasonable. So, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
