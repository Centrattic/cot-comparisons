He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband setting up his office in the bedroom, leading to disruptions for the wife.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband chose to work from the bedroom despite the basement being available and presumably quieter. The wife is handling the kids, chores, and also works from home. She's being asked to keep them all quiet so he can do conference calls, which is causing her a lot of stress and limiting her ability to do basic tasks like showering or taking a nap. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he prefers the bedroom because of the view, but the basement is presented as a viable alternative. The wife offered the basement as a solution, so maybe she's trying to accommodate him. But by not using the basement, he's creating a situation where she has to manage everything else around his work schedule. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and consideration. The husband is in a position where he could choose a less disruptive location, but he's choosing convenience for himself. The wife is already handling a lot, and the current setup is making her life harder. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, setting up the office in a place that causes so much disruption might be on him. The wife is being clear that she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom, which is a reasonable stance. She's not the one causing the disruption; the husband's choice of workspace is the root issue. \n\nSo, the author (the wife) is not in the wrong because she's trying to balance her responsibilities and has offered a better alternative. The husband is the one who's not compromising here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
