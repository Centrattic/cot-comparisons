He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband setting up his office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the author, who handles most of the housework and childcare.\n\nFirst, the husband chose to work from the bedroom despite being offered the basement, which would have been quieter. The author is now stuck managing the kids, chores, and her own work while he's in the bedroom, leading to a lot of inconvenience. The author told him she can't guarantee silence if he stays in the bedroom, which is a reasonable stance because she can't control the kids or her own needs. The husband is upset that the author isn't quiet, but she's arguing he should have chosen the basement.\n\nThe key points here are mutual responsibility. The husband made a choice that affects the author's ability to function. While the author could try to minimize disruptions, the root issue is his decision to work in a space that's not optimal for both. The author is setting boundaries by saying she can't promise silence, which is valid. The husband's job requires him to be in a quiet environment, but he should have considered the household dynamics when choosing his workspace. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she's trying to balance her responsibilities. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom without considering the consequences is a bigger issue here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
