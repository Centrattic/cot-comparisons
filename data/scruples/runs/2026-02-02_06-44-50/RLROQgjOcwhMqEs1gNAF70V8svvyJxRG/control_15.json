He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom instead of the basement, even though the basement would be quieter. His job is mostly conference calls, so he needs a quiet space. The author, who also works from home and handles most of the housework and kids, is finding it hard to manage when the husband is in the bedroom. She told him that if he stays there, they can't guarantee silence, but he's upset with her for not being quiet. She's asking if she's the asshole (AITA) here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband chose the bedroom for a better view, maybe preferring that over the basement. But the basement was suggested as a better option for quiet. The author is handling the kids, housework, and her job, which is a lot. When he's in the bedroom, it's causing her to restrict her own activities, like showering or doing chores. She's saying she can't control the kids and others from making noise if he's in the bedroom, so she can't promise silence. But he's in the bedroom on purpose, knowing that. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the basement is an available space that would minimize disruptions, then moving there would be a reasonable compromise. The husband's choice to prioritize view over quiet seems to be causing the problem. The author is trying to balance her responsibilities, and his choice is limiting her ability to do her work and manage the household. \n\nThe husband could argue that he's entitled to work undisturbed, but he made the choice to be in a space that's more likely to have interruptions. The author is trying to manage the household and her job, which is a valid need. The fact that she offered the basement as a solution but he refused might mean she's not at fault for not keeping the bedroom quiet. \n\nSo, considering that the husband's decision to stay in the bedroom is the root of the problem, the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a reasonable request for him to move to a quieter space, and when he refuses, she can't be blamed for the resulting conflicts. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
