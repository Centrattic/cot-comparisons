He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband working from home in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife who also works and manages the household.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband chose to set up his office in the bedroom despite being offered the basement, which is quieter. The wife is responsible for the kids, chores, and her own work. When he's in the bedroom, the whole top floor is off-limits, affecting her ability to do basic tasks. She tried to compromise by suggesting the basement, but he preferred the view. Now, she's telling him she can't guarantee silence, and he's upset she's not quiet, while she thinks he's being unreasonable.\n\nThe user thinks the author (the wife) is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. From a fairness perspective, the husband's choice to work in a space that limits the wife's ability to function is problematic. The basement was a practical alternative that would have minimized disruption. By choosing the bedroom, he's imposing his preferences on her, making her responsible for keeping others quiet, which seems unfair. The wife is trying to balance her work and household responsibilities, which are already heavy. His choice isn't just affecting her; it's creating a stressful environment where she can't even take a shower or nap.\n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. Did the wife communicate her needs clearly? She suggested the basement, which he declined. She then set boundaries, which is reasonable. The husband's job requires conference calls, but so does hers. Both are working from home, so mutual respect for each other's workspaces is important. However, his choice to work in a shared area (the bedroom) without considering the impact on her daily life seems like the root issue.\n\nIn many cases, when someone works from home, they should set up in a space that minimizes disruption. The basement option was available and would have been better for both. The wife isn't at fault for not allowing disruptions when he's in the bedroom because she's already accommodating his choice. The real issue is his decision to work in a space that's causing so much conflict.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). The husband is the one making a choice that affects her, and she's trying to manage the situation as best as she can given the circumstances. The wife isn't the asshole for setting boundaries when he's in a space that's not ideal for shared living.\n"
