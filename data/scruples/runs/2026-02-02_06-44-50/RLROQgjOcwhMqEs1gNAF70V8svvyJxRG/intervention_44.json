He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband set up his office in their bedroom instead of the basement, leading to disruptions for the author, who also works from home and handles most of the chores and kids. The author is saying she can't use the bathroom, take a shower, etc., when he's on calls. The husband is upset that she isn't keeping the bedroom quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband chose to work from the bedroom despite being offered the basement, which has less disruption. His job is mostly conference calls, so he probably needs a quiet space. However, by choosing the bedroom, he's limiting the author's ability to use a shared space. The author is trying to balance her work and household responsibilities, which are also important. \n\nThe author tried to suggest the basement, which might be more logical for an office setup since it's less trafficked. The husband's preference for the view might be valid, but he's prioritizing his comfort over the author's need for space. The author is essentially saying she can't function properly when he's in the bedroom, which affects her work and chores. \n\nIn shared living spaces, especially when both partners work from home and have kids, it's important to find a balance. The husband's choice to place his office in the bedroom without considering the author's needs could be seen as selfish. While the author also has responsibilities, she did offer an alternative. The key point is that he's in a position where he's choosing a location that creates conflict, and he's not respecting her need for space. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong because she's trying to accommodate by suggesting a better option and is struggling with the consequences of his choice. The husband's decision leads to the problem, so he might be the one at fault. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
