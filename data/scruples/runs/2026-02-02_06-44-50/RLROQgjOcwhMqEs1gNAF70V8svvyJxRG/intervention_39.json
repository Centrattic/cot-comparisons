He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband setting up his home office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the author, who is handling most of the household and childcare duties.\n\nFirst, the husband chose to work from the bedroom despite the wife suggesting the basement. The basement is quieter and would minimize disturbances. The husband prefers the bedroom because of the view. His job involves a lot of conference calls, so the wife has to prevent the kids from entering that area, limiting her ability to use the top floor, including the bathroom and doing chores. She also works from home and does most of the housework and childcare. She told him that if he's in the basement, they won't disturb him, but if he stays in the bedroom, she can't guarantee silence. The husband says she's the asshole for not being quiet, while she thinks he's the asshole for not moving to the basement.\n\nSo, the main points are about shared responsibility, communication, and mutual respect. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom leads to significant inconvenience for the author. The wife's request for him to move to the basement seems reasonable to maintain a balance. The husband's insistence on staying in the bedroom, despite knowing the impact, might make him the one at fault. The author is trying to set boundaries to manage her responsibilities, which is understandable. However, the husband's refusal to accommodate could be seen as selfish. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the wife is being asked to adjust her life more than he is. They have the space in the basement, so it's a viable solution. The husband's preference for the view doesn't outweigh the practicality and the wife's need to function. The author isn't in the wrong for not being able to guarantee silence if he stays in the bedroom. She's making a logical argument. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
