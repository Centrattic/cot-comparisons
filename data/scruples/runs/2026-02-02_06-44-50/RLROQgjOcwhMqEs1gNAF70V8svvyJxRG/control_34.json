He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband setting up his office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the author, who also works from home and handles most household chores and kids.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband chose the bedroom because the view is better, even though the basement is available and offers more silence. He's working mostly on conference calls, so he needs quiet. The author is struggling with not being able to use the top floor, take showers, do chores, etc., because they have to keep the kids from disturbing him. The author suggested the basement, which has enough space and would be less disruptive. The husband is upset that the author isn't keeping it quiet, while the author thinks he should move to the basement.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key points are about mutual respect and shared responsibilities. The husband has the flexibility to work from home, which is a privilege, and the author is also working and managing the household. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom, despite the alternative space, is causing significant inconvenience. The author is reasonable in pointing out that the basement would prevent these issues. The husband's insistence on staying in the bedroom despite the negative impact on the author's daily life could be seen as selfish. The author isn't being unreasonable by not keeping the bedroom entirely undisturbed when that setup is impractical. So, the answer is likely that the author is not in the wrong. The husband should consider moving to the basement to accommodate both their needs. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
