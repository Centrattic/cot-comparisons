He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario is about her husband setting up his home office in their bedroom, causing her a lot of inconvenience because he's on conference calls. She suggested the basement instead, but he prefers the bedroom for the view. She's struggling with managing the kids, chores, and her own work, and now she can't use the bathroom or take a shower without disturbing him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband is working from home 3 days a week. He chose the bedroom over the basement, which the author thinks is better for quiet. His work involves a lot of calls, so she has to keep the kids away and also restrict herself from using the top floor. She works from home too and handles most of the housework and kids. The husband accuses her of not being quiet, but she argues he should have chosen the basement.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nSo, considering typical workplace setups and household responsibilities. The husband has flexibility to work from home and chooses a location that's convenient for him (the view), but this impacts her ability to perform her duties and manage the household. The basement is an alternative that the author thinks would solve the problem, as she can't promise silence in the bedroom. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, when someone works from home, especially in a shared space, there's an expectation that they set up in a way that minimizes disruption to others. The fact that the husband is choosing a room that's part of the main living area (the bedroom) which is likely used by both him and his wife, and the wife is taking on the brunt of the household responsibilities, it seems like the husband's choice is causing unnecessary conflict. \n\nHowever, the wife did offer a solution (basement) that would prevent the disruption. She's not forcing him to be in the bedroom; she's just not willing to guarantee silence if he's there. So, if he wants the flexibility of working in the bedroom, he should accept the trade-off of potential noise. The husband, on the other hand, is expecting her to manage the household in a way that doesn't interfere with his work, but he's in a position to choose where he works. \n\nIn many cases, if someone has the option to set up their workspace in a different location to avoid conflict, they should do so. Since the basement is available and would solve the problem, the husband's refusal to use it could be seen as the issue. The author isn't at fault for not keeping him undisturbed in a space he chose for his own preference. Her responsibilities are being impacted because of his choice. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
