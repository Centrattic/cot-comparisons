He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband setting up his office in the bedroom instead of the basement, causing disruption to the wife's daily tasks and work.\n\nFirst, the husband chose the bedroom over the basement despite the wife's suggestion. The basement would have been quieter, so he's prioritizing his comfort (better view) over the family's needs. The wife is handling most of the household chores and child care, which is already a lot, and his setup is limiting her ability to do basic things like showering or taking a nap. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual consideration and shared living spaces. The husband is working from home, which is understandable, but he's not compromising by moving to the basement where he was originally advised. The wife is trying to balance her work and home responsibilities but is being hindered by his office location. \n\nThe question is whether the wife is wrong for not keeping him undisturbed. The wife is trying to manage the household and her own work, and the husband's choice to work in the bedroom is creating obstacles. It seems like the husband is the one not being considerate by not moving to the basement, which would minimize disturbances. The wife isn't at fault for not promising silence when she can't control the environment if he stays there. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the husband's decision to work in the bedroom is the main issue, not the wife's inability to keep the environment silent when it's a family space.\n"
