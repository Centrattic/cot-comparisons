He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband setting up his home office in the bedroom, leading to conflicts with the wife who handles most of the household and childcare duties.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The husband works from home part-time and chose the bedroom for his office, despite the wife's suggestion to use the basement. His job involves a lot of conference calls, so the wife has to prevent the kids from disturbing him. This restricts her movement in the house\u2014she can't shower, do chores, nap, etc. She works from home too and manages childcare. The husband argues that she's the problem for not keeping quiet, while she thinks he's wrong for not using the basement.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The husband has the option of using the basement, which is more isolated and would minimize disruptions. By choosing the bedroom, he's creating a situation where the wife's daily activities are limited. The wife is trying to balance work and household responsibilities, which is already a lot. The husband's choice impacts her ability to function, especially when they both work from home and have kids.\n\nIs the author (the wife) in the wrong? She made a reasonable suggestion to use the basement, which would solve the problem. By rejecting that and staying in the bedroom, the husband is the one causing the conflict. The wife is trying to manage her responsibilities and is not at fault for not being able to maintain silence when her needs are also valid. The husband's refusal to adjust his setup is the main issue here. So, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
