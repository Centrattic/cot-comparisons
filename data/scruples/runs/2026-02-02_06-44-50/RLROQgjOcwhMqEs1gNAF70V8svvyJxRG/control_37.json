He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband setting up his office in the bedroom, causing disruption for the author, who handles most of the housework and childcare. \n\nFirst, the husband works from home a few days a week and chose the bedroom over the basement for a better view. The author suggested the basement for less disruption, but he preferred the bedroom. Now, when he's on conference calls, the whole top floor is off-limits, affecting the author's ability to do chores, shower, etc.\n\nThe key points here are about shared space and mutual respect. The husband's choice to use the bedroom as an office impacts the author's daily life significantly. Even though he's working, the author has her own work and responsibilities. The basement was an available alternative that would have prevented the disruption. \n\nThe author's argument is that she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, so she's setting a boundary by suggesting he move. The husband is upset because she's not keeping quiet when he's on calls. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband made a choice that affects others without considering the consequences. The author is asserting her right to use the space, which is reasonable. Since the basement was an option, the husband's decision to stay in the bedroom is the root of the problem. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed; the issue is his placement of the office.\n"
