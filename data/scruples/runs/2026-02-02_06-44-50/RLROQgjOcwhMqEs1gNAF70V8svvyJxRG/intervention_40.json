He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband setting up his home office in their bedroom, causing disruptions for the author, who also works from home and handles most household duties.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband chose the bedroom over the basement despite the basement being more suitable for minimizing disruptions. His job is 90% conference calls, so he needs a quiet environment. However, by being in the bedroom, he's restricting the author's ability to use the space, take showers, do chores, etc. The author suggested the basement, which would avoid these issues. The husband refuses because of the view, and the author is now being criticized for not keeping him undisturbed.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. \n\nI need to weigh both sides. The husband's right to a quiet workspace is valid, but the author also has her own work and domestic responsibilities. By choosing a location that causes conflict, the husband might be contributing to the problem. The author's compromise was to move the office to the basement to avoid disruptions, but the husband didn't agree. So, the author's stance is that he's being unreasonable by not moving, while the husband thinks she should keep the bedroom quiet. \n\nConsidering that the basement is available and would prevent the conflict, the husband's refusal to use it could be seen as the root issue. The author is not at fault for not keeping him undisturbed because the problem stems from his choice of location. Therefore, the husband's decision to work in the bedroom creates the conflict, making him the one in the wrong. The author is justified in standing her ground about the basement option. So the answer should be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
