He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom, even though the wife suggested the basement for less disruption. He works mostly on conference calls, so the wife has to manage the kids and avoid disturbing him. This causes her to have trouble with her own chores, taking a shower, etc. The author (the wife) is saying that she's not in the wrong for not keeping her husband undisturbed, while he says she's the asshole for not being quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband chose to work in the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion. The basement is available and quieter, but he prefers the view. By choosing the bedroom, he's creating an environment where the wife's daily activities are restricted. The wife is handling most of the housework and childcare, which is already a lot. The fact that she can't even take a shower or nap without worrying about disturbing him seems unfair. \n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. If the husband had chosen the basement as the wife suggested, the problem wouldn't exist. His choice to be in the bedroom is the root cause. The wife is being asked to adjust her life to accommodate his work setup, which is understandable to a point, but if he's not willing to compromise, it's not entirely her fault. \n\nAlso, working from home can be challenging for both parties, but the husband's setup should ideally minimize disruption to household members. The wife's inability to perform her duties and take basic care because of his location seems like a significant issue. The husband's refusal to move to the basement, despite the wife's suggestion, could be seen as self-centered. \n\nSo, considering these points, the author (wife) isn't in the wrong. She's trying to balance work and home while dealing with a husband who isn't accommodating. His choice to work in the bedroom leads to the conflict, and she's justified in not being quiet if he's in a public space like the bedroom. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
