He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom even though the wife suggested the basement, which is quieter and less disruptive. Now, the wife can't do her usual things because the husband is working there, and she's stuck taking care of the kids and doing chores. She told him she can't promise silence if he's in the bedroom, and he's upset about that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband chose the bedroom for the view, even though the basement is available. He's working from home, but his job is mostly conference calls, which probably require a quiet environment. However, the wife is also working and handling most of the housework and kids. If the husband is in the basement, maybe that would make things easier for both of them, but he didn't choose that option. The wife tried to suggest the basement, but he refused. Now, she's saying she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, which is a valid point because the house is in use with kids. \n\nIs the wife in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed? Well, if he chose the bedroom despite the potential for noise, maybe he should have considered the impact on her. On the other hand, she did offer an alternative (basement) that would minimize disruption. By not choosing that, he's putting himself in a position where disturbances are more likely. The wife is trying to manage the household and her own work, and the husband's setup is limiting her ability to do her tasks. The fact that she's asking for him to move to the basement seems reasonable. If he's not willing, then maybe the wife isn't at fault for not keeping him undisturbed because she can't control the kids or the household activities. \n\nThe husband's job does require a quiet space, but he made the choice to set up in the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion. The wife's argument is that she can't control the environment if he's in the bedroom, which is true. So, maybe the husband is the one at fault for not choosing the basement, which would make his work less disruptive. The wife is trying to balance her own work and family responsibilities, and the husband's choice is making it harder for her. So, the author (the wife) isn't in the wrong because she's trying to manage her responsibilities and can't control the kids. The husband is the one who should have considered the alternative.\n"
