He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The husband set up his office in the bedroom instead of the basement, even though the basement would be less disruptive. He works mostly on conference calls, so the wife has to manage the kids and avoid disturbing him. This limits her ability to do chores, take showers, or rest. She suggested the basement, but he prefers the view in the bedroom. She told him she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, but he's upset with her for not being quiet during his calls.\n\nThe user thinks the author (the wife) is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. The husband chose the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion. The basement is available and less disruptive. The wife is juggling work, chores, and kids. By choosing the bedroom, the husband is creating a situation where he needs her to restrict her activities. The wife is setting boundaries by saying she can't promise silence if he's in the bedroom, which is reasonable because she can't control the kids. The husband is upset that she isn't keeping the kids quiet, but maybe he should have chosen the basement to avoid this conflict. \n\nSo, the key point is that the husband made a choice that leads to her being restricted. The wife is not at fault for not enforcing silence if he's in the bedroom. She's trying to manage her responsibilities. The husband's decision to be in the bedroom is the root of the problem. Therefore, the author (wife) is not in the wrong.\n"
