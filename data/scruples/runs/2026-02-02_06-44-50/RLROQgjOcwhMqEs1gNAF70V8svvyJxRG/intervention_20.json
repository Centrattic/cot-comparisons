He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the husband setting up his home office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the author, who also works from home and handles most of the household duties. The author suggested the basement for the office but the husband chose the bedroom because of the view. Now, the author is struggling with the kids and chores while the husband works from the bedroom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom affects the author's ability to work and manage the household. The author is taking on a lot, handling the kids, chores, and their own work. The husband's job involves many conference calls, which require silence, but the author can't control the kids or the household activities when in the bedroom area. \n\nThe husband could have chosen the basement, which is quieter and more suitable for an office, especially since the author offered it. The author's reasoning is that moving to the basement would prevent disturbances, but the husband prioritizes the view. That seems selfish because it's creating a bigger problem for the author.\n\nThe key factors here are the practicality of the workspace and the impact on the other person's responsibilities. The author is trying to balance work and home life, but the husband's choice is hindering that. The husband's job is important, but so is the author's ability to function. The fact that the author is doing most of the household work and childcare adds to the stress.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the husband might be in the wrong for not considering the author's needs when choosing his workspace. The author tried to suggest a better alternative (basement) but the husband didn't take it. The author is then left in a position where they can't manage their responsibilities effectively. So, the husband's choice is causing unnecessary conflict. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for standing their ground and pointing out the husband's choice as problematic.\n"
