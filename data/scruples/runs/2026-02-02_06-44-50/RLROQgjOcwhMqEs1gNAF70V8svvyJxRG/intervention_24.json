He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband setting up his office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife who also works from home and handles most of the household and childcare.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband chose the bedroom for his office because of the view, even though the basement has more space and would be quieter. The wife is frustrated because when he's on calls in the bedroom, she can't use the top floor, including the bathroom, laundry, etc. She suggested the basement, which he refused. Now, she's making him choose between the basement or not having the disruptions. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and shared responsibilities. The husband has the right to work from home, but his choice affects the wife's ability to work and manage the household. The wife is trying to balance her work and domestic duties, which are already heavy. By choosing the bedroom, he's making her bear the brunt of the disruptions. \n\nSetting up an office in a shared space might not consider the impact on others. The basement is an alternative that would prevent these issues. The wife is not being unreasonable by asking him to move there. The husband's refusal to consider the basement is the root of the problem here. The wife is trying to set boundaries to protect her own work and household responsibilities, which is valid. Therefore, the husband is more in the wrong for not compromising, not the wife.\n"
