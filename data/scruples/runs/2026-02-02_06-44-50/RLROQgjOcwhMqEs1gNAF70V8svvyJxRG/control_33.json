He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband setting up his office in the bedroom, causing disruption for the wife and kids. The husband has the option to work from the basement but chose the bedroom for a better view. The wife is handling most of the housework and childcare, and his setup is limiting her ability to do basic tasks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom might be his preference, but the wife is dealing with the consequences. The wife is trying to balance her own work, chores, and family. She suggested the basement as a solution for less disruption. By staying in the bedroom, he's making her responsible for keeping the environment quiet, which might be unfair. \n\nThe question is whether the author (the wife) is at fault. The key points here are about shared responsibility and compromise. The husband could have chosen the basement to minimize disruption, but he didn't. The wife can't control the kids perfectly, so expecting her to keep the top floor quiet might be unrealistic. She's already taking on more household duties, and his choice is making it harder for her. \n\nThe husband's decision to prioritize his view over the family's convenience might be the main issue. The wife isn't at fault for not being able to control external factors like the kids. The problem stems from his initial choice. The answer is likely that the wife isn't in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
