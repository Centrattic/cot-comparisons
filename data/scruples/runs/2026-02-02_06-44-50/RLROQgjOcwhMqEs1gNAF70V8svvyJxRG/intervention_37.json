He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband setting up his home office in the bedroom, which is causing disruption to the wife's ability to manage household tasks and work from home. The husband refuses to move the office to the basement despite the wife's suggestion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband works from home and chose the bedroom for better views, but his job involves a lot of conference calls, requiring silence. The wife, who also works from home and handles most household chores and childcare, argues that having the office in the bedroom restricts her movement and tasks. She offered the basement as an alternative, which would have guaranteed silence and less disruption. The husband, however, is unwilling to move there. \n\nThe wife's argument is that she can't control when the kids will be noisy, so she can't promise silence in the bedroom. The husband is upset because he feels she's being uncooperative. The user initially thinks the author (the wife) is in the wrong but is seeking confirmation.\n\nNow, analyzing responsibilities. In a shared living space, reasonable accommodations should be made for both parties to work effectively. The husband's job requires silence, and he has the option to move to the basement, which the wife suggested. However, he chose the bedroom. If the basement is available and would allow both to work without conflict, it seems the husband should consider that. The wife's suggestion is practical, but the husband's refusal to move might be the issue. \n\nBut the wife's refusal to allow him to use the basement isn't the case. She said they can't disturb him if he's in the basement, implying that if he were there, they wouldn't interfere. But he's in the bedroom, so she can't control the disruptions. So the problem lies in the husband's choice of location. If he's in a space that's shared (bedroom) and requires silence, he needs to consider the impact on others. \n\nThe wife is trying to balance her work and childcare duties. If the husband's setup is preventing her from doing her job and household tasks, that's a valid concern. The husband's priority on the bedroom's view seems less important than creating a work environment that doesn't disrupt his partner. \n\nSo, the key point is whether the husband's choice of location is reasonable. Since the basement is an option that would minimize disruption, his refusal to use it might make him the asshole. Therefore, the wife isn't in the wrong. She's trying to maintain her responsibilities and work while the husband isn't considering the impact of his decision. The answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
