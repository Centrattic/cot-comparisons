He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out who's in the wrong here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post (the author) is at fault in their situation with their husband.\n\nSo the husband set up his office in the bedroom instead of the basement. The author suggested the basement because it's quieter and more private. The husband prefers the view. Now, the problem is that when he's in the bedroom working, especially on conference calls, the author can't do basic things like shower, take a nap, or do chores because she has to keep the kids from disturbing him. The author works from home too and handles most of the household chores and childcare. She told him that if he stays in the bedroom, she can't guarantee silence, but if he went to the basement, they would never disturb him. The husband thinks she's the asshole for not being quiet, and she thinks he's the asshole for not going to the basement.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about shared living space and responsibilities. The husband chose to work in the bedroom, which is a shared space, knowing that the author also needs it for her own work and household duties. By choosing the bedroom, he's limiting her ability to use that space. The author is taking on most of the childcare and household tasks, which are necessary, and the husband's choice to work there creates conflict. \n\nThe author is trying to prioritize her responsibilities and her own needs, which are valid. The husband's preference for the view seems less critical compared to the practical impact on the author's ability to function. The author isn't being unreasonable in her request for the husband to use the basement, which is available and offers a better work-life balance. \n\nSo, the husband's choice to work in the bedroom is causing significant disruption, and the author is justified in pointing out the unfairness. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
