He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is a wife whose husband works from home a few days a week. He set up his office in their bedroom instead of the basement, which she suggested. His job involves a lot of conference calls, and she has to manage the kids and other chores. Because he's in the bedroom, she can't use the top floor for her activities, which affects her work and personal time. She told him that if he's in the basement, they won't disturb him, but she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom. Now they're arguing about who's the asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author (herself) is in the wrong, but she wants to know what others think. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The husband chose to work in the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion of the basement. The basement is described as having guaranteed silence and minimal disruption. The husband's preference is for the view. However, his presence in the bedroom disrupts her ability to work, do chores, and take care of the kids. She's taking on most of the household responsibilities, and his location is causing her significant inconvenience.\n\nNow, considering the husband's perspective: he might believe he has a right to work in a comfortable space, and he might not see the full extent of the disruption he's causing. From the wife's side, she's trying to balance her work and home duties, and his choice is limiting her space and time. \n\nThe husband's job setup is affecting her ability to manage the household and her own work. The basement is a viable alternative that would minimize disruptions. The wife's request is reasonable\u2014she's compromising by offering to keep him undisturbed if he moves to the basement. By choosing the bedroom, he's imposing limitations on her. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband's decision to prioritize his comfort (better view) over the wife's practical needs (space to work and manage chores) could be seen as the root of the problem. The wife is trying to set boundaries to protect her own responsibilities and well-being. \n\nSo, if the husband had chosen the basement, the wife wouldn't have an issue. By not doing so, he's creating a situation where she can't efficiently handle her duties. Therefore, the fault might lie more with the husband for not considering the practical implications of his choice. However, the wife might feel justified in pushing back because she's already taking on more responsibilities. \n\nThe question is whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed. If she's arguing that he should move to the basement, which is the better solution, then she's not wrong for advocating for that. The problem arises because he's in her space, making it hard for her to function. So, she's not at fault for not being able to guarantee silence in that scenario. She's in the right for trying to resolve the issue by suggesting a better arrangement. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
