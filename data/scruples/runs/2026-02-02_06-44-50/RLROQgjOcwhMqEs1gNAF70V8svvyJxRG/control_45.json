He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband setting up his office in the shared bedroom, causing the wife to have to restrict her own activities to avoid disturbing his work calls.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The husband chose to work from the bedroom despite being offered the basement option. He prioritizes the view, which might not be a valid reason given the disruption it causes. The wife is handling most of the housework and childcare, and his setup limits her ability to do basic tasks. \n\nThe husband's job is mostly conference calls, which do require a quiet environment. However, the wife is also working from home and managing the household. The main conflict is about space usage and mutual respect. The wife tried to suggest a better location (basement) that would minimize disruption, but he refused. By staying in the bedroom, he's creating a situation where the wife has to adjust her life around his work calls, which seems unfair.\n\nThe question is whether the wife is wrong for not keeping him undisturbed. The husband's choice to be in the bedroom led to the problem. The wife is not obligated to sacrifice her needs for his preference. The husband's refusal to use the basement is a key point. The wife is not in the wrong because she's not the one causing the disruption; the husband's location choice is the root cause. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
