He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario involves a husband working from home in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife and kids. The wife suggested moving the office to the basement, but he didn't. Now she's struggling with managing the household and kids when he's in the bedroom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider who is actually at fault here. The husband chose to set up his office in the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion to use the basement, which would have been less disruptive. His job is mostly conference calls, so he needs silence, but by choosing the bedroom, he's limiting the wife's ability to do her work and household tasks. \n\nThe wife is trying to balance her own work and childcare. If the office was in the basement, maybe the disruptions could be minimized. The husband's choice to prioritize the view over practicality is leading to conflict. \n\nThe author (wife) is frustrated because she can't even use the bathroom or take a shower without worrying about disturbing him. She's taking on most of the house chores and dealing with the kids. Her refusal to guarantee silence when he's in the bedroom is a reasonable stance because she can't control the kids or her own needs. \n\nSo, the husband's decision to stay in the bedroom despite knowing it creates problems might make him at fault. The wife is just trying to manage the situation as best as she can. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her needs and the practicality of the situation. The husband's choice is the root issue here. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
