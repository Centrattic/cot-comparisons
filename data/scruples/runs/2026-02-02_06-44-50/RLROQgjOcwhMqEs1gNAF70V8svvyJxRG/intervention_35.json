He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom, even though the wife suggested the basement. Now, when he's working from the bedroom, especially during conference calls, she has to manage the kids and can't use the top floor for chores or personal time. She's frustrated because he's in the room she uses for her bathroom and other tasks, so she can't take a shower or even take a nap without worrying about disturbing him. She's arguing that he should move to the basement, but he's upset that she's not keeping it quiet in the bedroom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband chose the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion. The wife is taking on a lot of household responsibilities and work from home, which is being hindered by his setup. The husband's job is mostly conference calls, so he needs quiet for that, but the wife's daily tasks and personal time are also being affected. \n\nThe question is whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. \n\nI need to think about the balance of responsibilities. The wife is handling most of the housework and childcare, and the husband's choice of workspace is making her life harder. The husband's job allows him to work from home, but he should have considered the family's needs when choosing a workspace. The basement was an option that would minimize disruption for both. \n\nThe wife's decision to not guarantee silence if he stays in the bedroom is a reasonable response to his choice. She's not being uncooperative; she's pushing back because his decision is causing her significant inconvenience. The husband's preference for the view might be valid, but it shouldn't override the practical impact on his spouse. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband should have chosen a location that doesn't interfere with the wife's responsibilities and personal time. The wife isn't at fault for not allowing disruptions that he caused himself by choosing an inconvenient location. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B). The husband is the one who chose the setup, so he's the one causing the conflict. The wife is asserting her right to manage her own time and responsibilities without unnecessary hindrance.\n"
