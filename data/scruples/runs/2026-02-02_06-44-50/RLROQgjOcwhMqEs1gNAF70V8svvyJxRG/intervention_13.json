He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband setting up his home office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife and kids. The wife suggests the basement for more space and silence, but he prefers the bedroom for the view. Now, she can't use the bathroom, do chores, etc., when he's on calls. She told him she can't promise quiet if he's in the bedroom, but he's upset she's not being quiet enough.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author (the wife) is in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but I need to evaluate both sides. The husband chose the bedroom over the basement despite the wife's suggestion. The basement was presented as a better option for less disruption. The wife feels her responsibilities are hindered because of his choice. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The husband made a decision that affects the household's daily life. The wife is managing work, housework, and kids. If the husband insisted on the bedroom for personal preference (view), then he's creating an environment where others can't function. The wife's inability to use the bathroom or take a nap is a significant issue. \n\nIn shared living spaces, especially when working from home, setting boundaries is important. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom, which is a common area for the family, might not consider the impact on others. The wife is trying to set boundaries by saying she can't guarantee quiet if he's in the bedroom, which is a valid point. However, she's also not being quiet, which the husband is upset about. \n\nBut the root cause is the husband's decision to work from the bedroom despite having a better alternative (basement). The wife is trying to balance her responsibilities and her own needs. So, the husband might be more at fault for not choosing the basement, which would minimize disruptions. The wife isn't in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed if he's in a shared space where others need to use the facilities. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. She's standing up for her needs and the practicality of the setup. The husband's choice to prioritize his view over the family's convenience is the main issue. So the answer is B.\n"
