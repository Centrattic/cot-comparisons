He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a husband who set up his office in the bedroom instead of the basement, leading to conflicts because he's on conference calls a lot. The wife is handling most of the housework and childcare, and his setup is making it hard for her to do her job or take care of the house.\n\nFirst, the husband chose the bedroom because of the view, but the wife suggested the basement for less noise. The husband is the one who made the choice to be in the bedroom. The wife is then trying to manage the kids and household tasks while he's there. Since he's on calls 90% of the time, that's a lot of disruption for her. She can't even use the bathroom or take a nap when the baby is asleep because she's worried about disturbing him. That sounds really tough.\n\nThe husband is working from home, which is a valid need, but so is her need to work and manage the household. He's in a position where he could have chosen the basement, which would have given him a quieter space and allowed her more freedom. By choosing the bedroom, he's limiting her ability to function. The wife is honest about her limitations\u2014she can't promise silence if he's in the bedroom, which makes sense because kids and housework are unpredictable. She's setting boundaries, which is reasonable. The husband, on the other hand, is not considering her workload and is getting upset when she can't be completely silent. \n\nSo, the key points are: the husband made a choice that impacts her daily life, she's trying to manage both work and home, and he's not accommodating her needs by moving to the basement. The wife isn't being unreasonable by not keeping him undisturbed when it's impossible. She's asking for mutual respect and practical solutions. Therefore, the husband might be the one not considering her situation, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
