He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom, even though the wife suggested the basement. The husband works from home a few days a week, mostly on conference calls. The wife ends up having to manage the kids and household tasks without being able to do her own things because the top floor is off-limits when he's working. She also works from home and does most of the chores and childcare. She told him that if he's in the basement, they won't disturb him, but if he stays in the bedroom, she can't guarantee silence.\n\nThe user thinks the author (the wife) is in the wrong, but I need to decide. Let's break it down. The husband chose the bedroom over the basement for a better view. The wife is handling most of the housework and childcare, which is already a lot. By setting up in the bedroom, he's limiting her ability to do her job and manage the house. The wife is clearly overwhelmed. The husband's job is mostly conference calls, which require quiet, but he had the option to go to the basement where it's quieter, which would have solved the problem. Instead, he chose convenience (better view) over the wife's ability to function. That seems like he's the one making a selfish choice. The wife is trying to communicate that her needs matter too. So, the husband is the one in the wrong here. The author (wife) is not in the wrong because she's standing up for her needs and the practicalities of their living space. She's trying to find a compromise by offering the basement option. The husband is not considering the impact of his choice on her. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
