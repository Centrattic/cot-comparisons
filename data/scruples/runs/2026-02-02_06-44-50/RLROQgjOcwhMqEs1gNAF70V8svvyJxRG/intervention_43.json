He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion to use the basement. His job involves a lot of conference calls, so the wife has to manage the kids and avoid disturbing him, which limits her ability to do chores, take a shower, nap, etc. The wife works from home too and handles most of the housework and kids. She told him she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, but he says she's the asshole for not being quiet, while she thinks he's wrong for not using the basement.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author (wife) is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide if it's A (author wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFirst, the husband chose the bedroom despite the wife's reasonable suggestion. The basement is available and would be quieter. By choosing the bedroom, he's causing disruption. The wife is trying to manage the household and her own work while also dealing with the kids. Her argument is that she can't control the kids' behavior, so she can't promise silence. \n\nThe husband's job is important, but he had the option to choose a less disruptive location. The wife is not at fault for the husband's choice. She's being reasonable in saying she can't guarantee silence if the kids are around. The husband is in the wrong for not considering the practicality of the basement. So the author (wife) is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
