He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom, even though the wife suggested the basement which is quieter. His job involves a lot of conference calls, so the wife has to make sure the kids don't disturb him. But this setup is causing problems for the wife because she can't use the top floor for chores, showers, etc. She works from home too and handles most of the housework and kids. She told him that if he stays in the bedroom, she can't promise silence, but if he went to the basement, they would never bother him. Now he's upset with her for not being quiet, and she's arguing he's in the wrong for not choosing the basement.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about mutual respect and consideration. The husband chose a location that's inconvenient for his wife's responsibilities. The wife made a suggestion that would solve the problem but he refused. Now she's setting boundaries by saying if he's in the bedroom, she can't guarantee quiet. He's upset, but she's the one trying to balance work, chores, and kids. The husband's preference for the view is conflicting with her practical needs. Since he didn't take the reasonable alternative offered, the problem arises from his choice. The wife is trying to protect her space and ability to function. So the answer is probably B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
