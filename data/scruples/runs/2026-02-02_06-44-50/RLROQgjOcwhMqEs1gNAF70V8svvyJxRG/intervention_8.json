He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom, which is causing a lot of disruption for the wife. She suggested the basement, which is quieter and more private. The husband prefers the bedroom because of the view. He works mostly on conference calls, so the wife has to manage the kids and other tasks around his work schedule. The wife works from home too and does most of the housework and childcare. She's frustrated because he's in the bedroom, limiting her ability to do basic things like showering or taking breaks. She told him that if he's in the basement, she can guarantee no disturbances, but she can't promise that if he's in the bedroom. The husband thinks she's the problem, while she thinks he's the one being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband chose the bedroom as his office despite the wife's suggestion of the basement. The basement is described as having less disruption, so why choose the bedroom? The view is better, but that's a personal preference. The wife's main issue is that his choice of workspace is limiting her ability to manage the household and her own work. She's taking on the bulk of the childcare and housework, which is already a heavy load. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and consideration. When someone works from home, it's generally expected that they will set up their workspace in a way that minimizes disruption to others. The husband's choice to be in the bedroom, a shared space that's also used for personal activities, might not be the most considerate option. The wife is trying to balance her work and household duties, and his presence in the bedroom is creating a conflict. \n\nFrom the wife's perspective, she's making a reasonable request for him to use the basement to avoid the issues that come with sharing the bedroom as an office. The fact that he's not willing to compromise here could be seen as the problem. The wife is then not in the wrong for setting boundaries and explaining the consequences of his choice. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel that his work needs are important and that the view is a valid reason to stay in the bedroom. But his job doesn't require physical presence in the bedroom, just a quiet place for calls. The basement seems to offer that, so his refusal to move there could be seen as selfish. \n\nConsidering all this, the author (the wife) is not in the wrong. She's trying to manage a busy household and work from home, and her suggestion to use the basement is practical. The husband's insistence on the bedroom is causing unnecessary conflict. So the answer should be B.\n"
