He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the husband setting up his office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the author, who has to manage the kids, housework, and also works from home. The husband prefers the bedroom because of the view and insists on not moving to the basement where he could be more isolated. The author is frustrated because she can't do basic things like shower or take a nap when he's on calls.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's job requires conference calls, so he needs a quiet environment. He chose the bedroom over the basement even though the basement would be quieter. The author is handling most of the household responsibilities and her work, but his setup is limiting her ability to function. \n\nThe key points here are about expectations and communication. The husband was given a choice by the author to set up in the basement to avoid disruptions, but he chose otherwise. The author then can't guarantee silence in the bedroom, leading to conflicts. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, maybe the husband should have prioritized the basement for his own productivity and to minimize his wife's stress. However, the author might not be in the wrong because she communicated her concerns and offered a solution. The husband's refusal to take that solution could be his issue. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she's trying to manage the household and her work while he's in the bedroom, she's not at fault for not being able to control the kids or household activities when he's working. The husband's choice to stay in the bedroom despite knowing it would cause problems might be his fault. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the wife could have set clearer boundaries or negotiated differently. But given that she already suggested the basement as an alternative and he rejected it, her frustration is valid. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. I think the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
