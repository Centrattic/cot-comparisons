He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about the husband working from home in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife. The wife suggested the basement, but he chose the bedroom for the better view. Now, she can't do basic tasks because of his work setup.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom affects her ability to manage the household and work. She's handling most of the chores, kids, and her job. The husband's job is mostly conference calls, so he needs silence, which is why he's in the bedroom. But she can't use the bathroom, shower, etc., when he's there. \n\nThe key point is the setup. The husband has the option of the basement, which is quieter. The wife told him she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, so she's setting boundaries. The husband is upset that she's not keeping quiet, but she can't control that if the kids are around. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the husband's choice to be in the bedroom is causing her inconvenience. She's offering a solution (basement) that he's refusing for his preference. So, maybe he's the one in the wrong because he's prioritizing his comfort over her needs. But the user thinks the author (wife) is in the wrong. Wait, the author is the wife here. So, if the husband's setup is causing issues, and she's trying to set boundaries, is she at fault?\n\nThe wife is not being quiet by choice but because the kids are active. She's managing the household and her job. The husband is choosing a location that disrupts her. So the husband's choice is the problem. The wife is trying to mitigate it by suggesting the basement. Therefore, the husband is the one in the wrong for not moving to the basement. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). But the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Hmm. Need to make sure. The user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. Based on the analysis, the author (wife) is not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
