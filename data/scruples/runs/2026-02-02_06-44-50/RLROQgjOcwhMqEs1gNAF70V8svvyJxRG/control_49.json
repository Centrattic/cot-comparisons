He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the husband working from home in their bedroom, causing disruptions because of conference calls. The wife suggests moving to the basement for less disturbance, but he prefers the bedroom for the view. She ends up having to manage the kids and chores without being able to use the bathroom or take a shower when he's on calls. She sets up a rule that if he stays in the bedroom, she can't guarantee silence, but if he moves to the basement, they won't disturb him.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author (the wife) is in the wrong. The husband chose to work from the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion of the basement. His job involves many calls, which require silence. However, by choosing the bedroom, he's creating a situation where the wife can't use their shared space. The wife is trying to balance work, chores, and kids. She's not being unreasonable by not promising silence when they're in their own bedroom. The husband's choice to prioritize the view over the practicality of working in a separate space might be the root issue.\n\nThe key points are: the husband's setup affects the wife's ability to use the bedroom, he's not willing to compromise by moving to the basement, and the wife is setting boundaries. Since the husband is the one making a choice that causes the conflict, the wife isn't in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed when he's in their shared space. So the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
