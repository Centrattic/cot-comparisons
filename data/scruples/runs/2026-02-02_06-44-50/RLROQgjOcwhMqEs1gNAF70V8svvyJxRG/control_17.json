He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's husband setting up his home office in their bedroom, leading to conflicts over noise and space. The author is struggling with balancing her own responsibilities and the husband's work setup.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband works from home part-time and chose the bedroom as his office, even though the basement is available. The author suggested the basement for fewer disturbances, but he preferred the view. Now, when he's in the bedroom, she can't do daily tasks like showering, chores, or napping because the kids and her activities might disrupt his conference calls. She's handling most of the housework and childcare, so his office setup is hindering her ability to function. She told him she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom but can in the basement. The husband thinks she's the problem for not being quiet, while she thinks he's wrong for not using the basement.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's evaluate both sides. The husband has a job that requires focus and frequent calls, so he needs a quiet space. However, choosing the bedroom (a shared space) over the available basement creates conflict. The author is taking on a lot of domestic responsibilities, and the current setup is making it hard for her to manage her work and family duties. The fact that there's an alternative space (basement) that could solve this issue suggests that the husband's choice is contributing to the problem. The author's request for him to move to the basement is reasonable since it would prevent disruptions without affecting her ability to use the main floor. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, both partners need a balance. The husband has a right to work without interruptions, but the author also needs space to manage her responsibilities and personal time. By choosing the bedroom, he's limiting her use of the house, which isn't ideal. The author isn't refusing to be quiet; she's pointing out the impracticality of his setup. The husband's refusal to consider the basement is a key issue here. \n\nIn many relationships, compromise is essential. The author is suggesting a solution that would satisfy both parties, but the husband is refusing, leading to conflict. The author isn't wrong for holding her ground here. The problem lies in the husband's decision to use a shared space for his office without considering the impact on his partner. So, the author isn't in the wrong; the husband is being unreasonable by not using the basement. Answer B.\n"
