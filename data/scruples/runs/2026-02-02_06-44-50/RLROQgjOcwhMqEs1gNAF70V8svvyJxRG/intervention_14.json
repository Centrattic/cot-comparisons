He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the husband works from home and set up his office in their bedroom despite the wife suggesting the basement. The wife now has to manage the kids and household tasks but is restricted because the husband is on calls in the bedroom, causing her to be unable to do basic things like showering or taking a nap.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband chose the bedroom for the view, even though the basement was an option. The wife is handling most of the household chores and childcare, which is time-consuming. The husband's setup is causing her inconvenience. The question is whether she's wrong for not keeping him undisturbed when he's working from the bedroom, as he requested.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author (wife) is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. So the key points here are about mutual respect and practicality. The husband's choice affects the wife's ability to manage her responsibilities. Setting up in the basement would minimize disruptions, but he chose not to. The wife is honest about her limitations, saying she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, so she's setting boundaries. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband's decision to prioritize his comfort (better view) over the family's functional space might be the issue. The wife is trying to balance her work and household duties, which are also important. The husband's work from home setup should ideally accommodate the family's needs, but he's not compromising. The wife is not wrong for not being able to ensure silence when she's managing the kids and chores. The problem stems from the husband's choice to be in the bedroom, so the responsibility for the disruption lies with him. Therefore, the author (wife) is not in the wrong.\n"
