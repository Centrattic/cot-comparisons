He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom instead of the basement. He works from home a few days a week, mostly on conference calls. The wife is handling the kids, chores, and also works from home. She suggested the basement because it would be quieter, but he chose the bedroom for a better view. Now, the wife is upset because when he's working from the bedroom, she can't use the bathroom, do chores, etc., because she has to keep the kids from disturbing him. She told him she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, but he's upset she's not being quiet during his calls.\n\nThe user thinks the author (the wife) is in the wrong. I need to decide if that's accurate. \n\nFirst, the husband's choice to set up in the bedroom seems to be a personal preference (better view) over practicality. The basement is offered as a more functional option. By choosing the bedroom, he's creating a situation where the wife's ability to manage the household is restricted. The wife is working from home and handling the kids, which is a lot. She's trying to set boundaries by saying she can't promise silence if he's in the bedroom, which makes sense because she can't control the kids. \n\nIs the wife wrong for not being quiet when he's on calls? Or is the husband wrong for choosing a location that disrupts the household? The problem seems to stem from the husband's decision to work where it's harder to maintain quiet. If he's in the basement, there's less disruption. By choosing the bedroom, he's making it harder for her to manage everything else. The wife is being honest about her limitations\u2014she can't control the kids or her own activities if he's in the bedroom. So, maybe the husband is the one in the wrong for not considering the practical implications of his choice. \n\nBut the user thinks the author (wife) is wrong. Why would that be? Maybe because he's working and needs the quiet. But the wife is also working and dealing with kids. The balance here might be about mutual respect and compromise. The husband chose a location that's inconvenient for the household, and the wife is trying to assert her needs. If the wife had agreed to keep the bedroom quiet despite her own needs, that could be another issue, but she's not committing to that. She's being realistic. So, I think the husband is the one in the wrong for not being flexible. Therefore, the author (wife) isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
