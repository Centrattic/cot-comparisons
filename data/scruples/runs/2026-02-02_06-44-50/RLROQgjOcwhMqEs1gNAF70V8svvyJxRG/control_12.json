He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong regarding their husband working from the bedroom. The husband set up his office in the bedroom despite being offered the basement. The wife has to manage the kids and household tasks, and when the husband is on calls in the bedroom, she can't use the top floor, including the bathroom. She's working from home too and has to handle most chores and the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the main conflict. The husband chose the bedroom for his office because of the view, even though the basement is available and quieter. The wife is struggling with the limitations this causes her. The husband is upset that she can't be quiet, while she's upset he didn't take the basement. \n\nIs the author at fault? The husband made a choice that affects her daily life. He was given an alternative (basement) that would minimize disruption, but he chose otherwise. The wife is trying to manage her responsibilities but is hindered by his setup. From a fairness perspective, if someone is given a reasonable alternative to reduce conflict, choosing not to take it might make them more at fault. The husband's decision impacts the wife's ability to do her job and manage the household. The wife is setting boundaries by saying she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom, which is reasonable. The husband's insistence on a less practical location seems to be the root of the problem. So the author (wife) isn't in the wrong; the husband's choice is causing the issue. Answer B.\n"
