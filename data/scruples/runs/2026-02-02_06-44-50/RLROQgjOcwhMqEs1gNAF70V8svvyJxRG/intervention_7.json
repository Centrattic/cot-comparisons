He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband setting up his home office in the bedroom, causing disruptions because he's on conference calls. The wife is struggling with managing the kids and household tasks while he's there, and she's telling him he can't stay in the bedroom if he expects silence. He's working from the basement otherwise, so why the bedroom? The key points are about mutual work responsibilities, shared space, and communication.\n\nFirst, the husband chose the bedroom for his office despite the basement being available and presumably quieter. The wife is handling most of the childcare and housework, which is already a lot. By having his office in the bedroom, he's creating a situation where she can't use the top floor freely, affecting her ability to work and manage the house. The wife sets boundaries, saying she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, which seems reasonable given the circumstances. \n\nThe husband argues she's the asshole for not being quiet, but he's the one who made a choice that affects both their workspaces. The wife's request for him to move to the basement to avoid conflicts is logical. The user initially thinks the author (the wife) is in the wrong, but I need to see if that's accurate.\n\nIs the wife at fault for not keeping him undisturbed? Well, she's managing the household and kids, which isn't a simple task. The husband's decision to work in the bedroom without considering the impact on her responsibilities seems more problematic. The wife is trying to balance both their work and home life, and her setting boundaries is a reasonable response. So, the husband's choice to work in the bedroom despite the alternative spaces available might be the root of the issue. Therefore, the wife isn't in the wrong for holding her ground.\n"
