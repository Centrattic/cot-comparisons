He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out this situation. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the husband setting up his office in the bedroom, leading to conflicts when the wife needs to manage their kids, chores, and her own work.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband chose the bedroom for his office because of the better view, even though the basement is available and quieter. The wife is handling most of the household tasks, kids, and her own work from home. The problem is that when the husband is in the bedroom working, especially on conference calls, the wife can't do anything in the top floor, including basic tasks like showering or napping. She told him she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, and he's upset that she's not keeping quiet. The wife thinks he's wrong for not using the basement.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author (the wife) is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. So, I need to assess if the wife is being unreasonable. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and shared responsibilities. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom is causing significant inconvenience to the wife. The basement is available and would prevent these disturbances. The husband's job is mostly conference calls, which require quiet, but his choice to work in a space that's not conducive to that (since the wife needs to use the same area) creates conflict. The wife is taking on the bulk of domestic duties and her work, which is being impacted. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the husband should consider the practical effects of his choice on his wife. The basement is a viable alternative that would solve the problem. The wife's refusal to make guarantees about silence is reasonable given the circumstances. The husband's insistence on the bedroom for aesthetic reasons (better view) seems less important compared to the practical issues it's causing. \n\nThe wife is trying to balance her own work and household responsibilities, which is valid. The husband's choice is causing her to lose personal time and ability to perform necessary tasks. The wife isn't being inconsiderate; she's pointing out the impracticality of his decision. The husband, on the other hand, is prioritizing his own comfort over the wife's practical needs. \n\nTherefore, the husband might be at fault here for not choosing a more functional location for his office. The wife is acting in her own interest and that of the household by suggesting the basement, which is a more logical solution. So, the author (the wife) isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
