He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband working from home in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the author who has to manage the kids, chores, and also works from home. The husband refused to move his office to the basement, which the author suggested for less disturbance. The author now can't use the top floor for anything when he's on calls.\n\nSo, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought the author is wrong but wants to know my opinion. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the husband chose to set up his office in the bedroom despite being offered the basement. The reason given is the view, which might not be a strong justification compared to the disruption caused. The author is handling most of the household chores and work, which is a lot to manage. The husband's work setup is affecting her ability to do basic tasks, like using the bathroom or showering. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and consideration. The husband's choice to prioritize view over the family's convenience is causing significant issues. The author is trying to set boundaries by saying they can't guarantee silence in the bedroom but can in the basement. The husband is upset about the author not being quiet, but he's the one who's causing the problem by being in the bedroom.\n\nThe author is advocating for her own needs and the family's well-being. It's about shared living space and balancing work responsibilities. The husband's refusal to compromise might be the real issue here. The author isn't the one causing the disruptions; the husband's office location is the root of the problem. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. She's trying to maintain a functional household and her own work-life balance. The husband should have considered the impact of his choice on others in the house. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
