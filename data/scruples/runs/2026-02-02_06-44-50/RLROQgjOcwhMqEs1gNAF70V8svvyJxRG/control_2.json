He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a wife who works from home and takes care of most of the house chores and the kids. Her husband recently switched jobs and now works from home a few days a week. He set up his office in their bedroom, even though she suggested the basement, which is quieter and more private. The husband prefers the bedroom because of the view. His job is mostly conference calls, so when he's on calls, the whole top floor is off-limits, including their bathroom and areas where she needs to do chores or take a nap. The author is frustrated because she can't even use the bathroom or do basic things in peace when he's working from the bedroom. She told him that if he's in the basement, she can make sure he's not disturbed, but staying in the bedroom means she can't make that promise. Now they're fighting about who's the asshole.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the husband chose to set up his office in the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion of the basement. The basement would be quieter, so maybe that's a better place for his work setup. The wife is handling most of the housework and childcare, which is already a lot. When he's in the bedroom, she can't use the bathroom, take a shower, or take a nap. That seems like a significant disruption to her daily life. On the other hand, the husband wants to work in the bedroom for the view. But the problem is that his choice affects her ability to function in her home.\n\nFrom the wife's perspective, she's trying to balance her work and home responsibilities. Her husband's decision to work in the bedroom creates a situation where she can't even do basic tasks without disturbing him. The husband is expecting silence when he's on calls, but he's in the bedroom, which is a shared space. The wife is not obligated to make sure the whole top floor is off-limits to the kids just so he can work there. She's already taking on a lot, and his choice is making her tasks impossible.\n\nThe husband's argument is that he's working from home, so he needs the space. But he didn't take into account the impact on his wife's well-being. The basement was available and would have been a better solution for both. By choosing the bedroom, he's prioritizing his comfort over her ability to manage their household. That seems unfair. The wife is not the one causing the disturbance; the husband's setup is the source of the problem.\n\nI think the key points here are about shared space and mutual consideration. The husband's choice to use the bedroom for his office without considering the wife's responsibilities is the main issue. The wife is justified in pointing out that if he had chosen the basement, there wouldn't be these disruptions. She's not wrong for holding him accountable for his decision's impact on her.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
