He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the original post) is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband setting up his home office in the bedroom, causing disruption to the wife's routine and responsibilities.\n\nFirst, the husband chose to work from the bedroom despite the wife suggesting the basement. The basement is quieter and less disruptive. The wife ends up having to manage the kids and household tasks without being able to take showers, do chores, or nap. The husband's job involves a lot of conference calls, so the wife can't make noise. The author of the post is the wife, and she's saying that she told the husband she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, but he's upset that she's not being quiet. She's asking if she's the asshole (AITA) for not keeping him undisturbed.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, with options A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to analyze both sides. The husband's choice to be in the bedroom is causing significant disruption. The wife is handling most of the household and childcare, which is already a lot. By choosing the bedroom, he's limiting her space and time to do basic tasks. The husband could have heeded the wife's suggestion to use the basement, which would have been more considerate. \n\nThe wife is honest about her inability to guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, which is a reasonable stance. She's not avoiding responsibility but is pointing out the practical limitations. The husband is upset because he expects silence, but he's the one who chose the location. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the husband made a decision that impacts the wife's daily life without considering the consequences. The wife's response is about setting boundaries. So, the husband might be in the wrong for not considering the wife's needs. Therefore, the author (wife) is not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
