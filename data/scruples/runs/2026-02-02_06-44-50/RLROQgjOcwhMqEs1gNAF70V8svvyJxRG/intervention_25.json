He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband setting up his home office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife who also works from home and handles most of the household chores and kids.\n\nFirst, the husband chose the bedroom over the basement, which is quieter. The wife suggested the basement to minimize disturbances. The husband's job is mostly conference calls, so he needs silence. But the wife is stuck managing kids and chores on the top floor, can't use the bathroom freely, etc. The wife is trying to balance her work and responsibilities but the husband's setup is making it hard. She told him she can't guarantee quiet if he's in the bedroom, but he says she's the asshole for not being quiet. She thinks he's the asshole for not taking the basement.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about shared living spaces and mutual respect. While the husband has a right to his work environment, he's choosing a space that's causing significant hardship for his spouse. The wife is already taking on more responsibilities, like handling the kids and chores, and his setup is making her tasks harder. The husband's insistence on the bedroom might not be considering her needs. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. However, the question is whether the author (wife) is in the wrong. The husband's choice to prioritize his view over the practicality and his wife's ability to function could be the issue. The wife's argument is that she's not able to work or take care of the house properly because of his decision. \n\nI think the husband is making a choice that's affecting her work-life balance. Since they have the space in the basement, moving there would solve the problem. The wife is trying to set boundaries, which is reasonable. So the husband might be in the right for needing a quiet work space, but the location he chose is causing problems. Therefore, the author (wife) isn't in the wrong for not promising silence when he's in the bedroom. She's standing up for her own needs. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
