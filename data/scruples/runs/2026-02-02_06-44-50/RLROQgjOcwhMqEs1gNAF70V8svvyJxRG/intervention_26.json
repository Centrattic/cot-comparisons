He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband setting up his home office in the bedroom, causing conflicts with the wife's ability to do chores and take care of the kids.\n\nFirst, the husband chose the bedroom over the basement despite the wife's suggestion. The basement is quieter and would minimize disruptions. His reason is the better view. That seems like a personal preference that might not consider the wife's needs. \n\nThe wife works from home too and handles most household tasks and childcare. The husband's location in the bedroom is limiting her ability to do her job and manage the home. She can't even take a shower or nap without worrying about disturbing him. She set boundaries by saying she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, which is a reasonable response given the circumstances.\n\nThe husband is using conference calls, which require quiet. However, by choosing a space that's central to the family area, he's creating a conflict. The wife is trying to manage the household but is being restricted. The basement offers a more isolated space that would make work and home life coexist better. \n\nThe wife isn't asking him to change her behavior; she's asking him to consider her needs by moving his office. The husband is insisting on his preference without considering the impact. In this case, the wife seems to be standing up for her own needs, which are valid. The husband's choice is causing unnecessary conflict. \n\nSo, the author (wife) is not in the wrong. She's trying to balance work and household responsibilities, and her request for him to move his office to a less disruptive location is reasonable. The husband is the one not considering the practical implications of his choice. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
