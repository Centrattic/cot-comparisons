He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband set up his office in their bedroom despite being told the basement would be better. The wife is struggling with managing the kids and household tasks because he's in the bedroom, which limits her ability to do things like take a shower or nap.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband prefers the bedroom for the view and works mostly on calls, so he needs quiet. The wife is handling most of the household and childcare, and his presence in the bedroom is causing her a lot of stress and limiting her personal time. She suggested the basement, which has more space and would be quieter, but he refused. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and shared responsibilities. Setting up an office in a shared space like the bedroom can infringe on the other partner's needs. The wife is working from home too and managing the house and kids. By choosing the bedroom, the husband is making it hard for her to do her job and take care of herself. \n\nThe wife's refusal to guarantee silence is understandable because she's handling the kids and can't control their behavior. The husband is being unreasonable by not considering the alternative space that would be better for everyone. He's essentially asking her to restrict her activities to ensure his comfort, which is not fair. \n\nSo the author (the wife) is not in the wrong. She's trying to balance work and family, and the husband should have chosen a space that doesn't disrupt her so much. The answer should be B.\n"
