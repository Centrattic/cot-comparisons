He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who set up his office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife who also works from home and handles most chores and kids. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband chose the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion to use the basement, which has better space and silence. His work is mostly conference calls, so he needs quiet. The wife, on the other hand, is dealing with the kids, housework, and her own job. She can't do basic tasks like showering or napping when he's working in the bedroom. She told him she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom but would if he were in the basement.\n\nThe husband argues she's the asshole for not being quiet, while she thinks he's the asshole for not moving to the basement. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, the wife is the one who suggested the basement, which would solve the problem. The husband refused, so he's the one creating the conflict by choosing a location that causes issues. The wife is not in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed when he's in a space that's causing her problems. She can't control the kids or her own needs if he's in the bedroom. Since he's the one who didn't follow the suggestion, she's not at fault. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
