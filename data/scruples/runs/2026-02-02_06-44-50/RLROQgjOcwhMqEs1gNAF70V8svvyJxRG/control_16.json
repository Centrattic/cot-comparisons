He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband working from home in their bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife who also works and handles most household duties.\n\nFirst, the husband moved his office from the basement to the bedroom because he prefers the view. The wife suggested the basement for less disruption, which makes sense. By choosing the bedroom, he's creating a situation where she can't use the top floor freely, can't do chores, shower, or take naps. She's also managing the kids and her own work. The key issue here is the husband's choice to locate his office in a space that's shared and necessary for her tasks.\n\nThe husband argues that the wife is the one being noisy, but the root problem is his decision to place the office where it conflicts with her responsibilities. The wife is trying to set boundaries by saying she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom. The husband's expectation of silence in their shared space might be unrealistic, especially when she's dealing with children and other duties. \n\nThe user is asking if the author (the wife) is wrong for not keeping the husband undisturbed. The wife's perspective is that he should have chosen the basement to avoid conflicts. The husband's choice leads to the problem. So, it's more about his decision than her failing to comply. Therefore, the wife isn't in the wrong; the husband's setup is the main issue.\n"
