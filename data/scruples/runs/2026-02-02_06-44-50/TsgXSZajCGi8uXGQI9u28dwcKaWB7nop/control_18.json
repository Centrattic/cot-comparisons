I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is in a family where the grandfather and some relatives hold harmful views. They're pressured to agree or stay silent to avoid being ostracized, like their cousin was. The author keeps quiet, feigns agreement, and is focused on getting the inheritance. The core question is whether this makes them an asshole.\n\nEthically, there's a conflict between personal gain and moral integrity. The grandfather's views are clearly harmful, and the author finds them hateful. However, to avoid losing the inheritance, they pretend to agree. The cousin's experience shows the family doesn't tolerate dissent, which adds a layer of fear.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as morally wrong because they're complicit in perpetuating harmful ideologies, even if they don't believe them. By not challenging these views, they might be enabling the grandfather's behavior. But they're also manipulating the situation for personal benefit, which could be considered selfish.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't acting on their values by staying silent. The cousin's experience shows the family's harsh response, which might make the author feel trapped. The inheritance part adds a financial motive, which complicates things. Some might argue that using someone's prejudices to gain from their death is unethical, regardless of the personal gain.\n\nBut others might say that the author isn't expressing the views, just pretending to agree. They're not actively promoting the beliefs, just avoiding confrontation. The inheritance isn't the fault of the grandfather, so the author's desire to receive it might be separate from the moral issue of pretending to agree.\n\nHowever, the key point is that the author is choosing to be complicit in a harmful environment for personal gain. Even if they don't express the views themselves, their silence and feigned agreement could be seen as endorsing them indirectly. The financial benefit from someone's prejudiced views might also be ethically problematic.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author is making a choice to prioritize personal gain over moral integrity, which could make them an asshole. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
