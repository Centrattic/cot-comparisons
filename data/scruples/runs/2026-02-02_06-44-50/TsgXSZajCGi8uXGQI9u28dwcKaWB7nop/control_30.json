I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's grandfather is described as a racist, homophobic person, and a significant part of the family shares similar views. The author disagrees but keeps quiet to avoid being ostracized, like their cousin was. The cousin tried to call out the grandfather once and was excluded from the family. The author is tolerating the grandfather's behavior, even smiling and nodding when he makes offensive remarks, with the goal of eventually getting the inheritance once the grandfather passes.\n\nNow, considering morality. The author is complicit in a harmful environment by not speaking out. They're allowing themselves to be part of a system that upholds hate, even if privately they disagree. That's a problem because silence in the face of injustice can be as harmful as active participation. The author is prioritizing financial gain over ethical behavior, which might be seen as selfish. They're also treating a family member as a \"pinata\" to exploit, which is a dehumanizing way to view someone.\n\nHowever, there's a context here. The author is in a position of power imbalance, fearing ostracism and losing the inheritance. Their cousin's experience shows the risks of speaking out. So maybe the author is trying to survive in a hostile environment. But the question is whether this makes them an asshole. On one hand, they're morally complicit. On the other, they're acting out of self-preservation. \n\nBut the act of pretending to agree with harmful ideologies, even if reluctantly, contributes to a culture that perpetuates those ideologies. The author isn't just staying silent; they're actively faking agreement, which is a form of moral compromise. The ends (getting inheritance) don't necessarily justify the means (pretending to endorse hatred). So while understandable, the author is complicit in a way that's ethically questionable.\n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions support a harmful environment, even if they're not directly causing it. They could find ways to disengage without pretending to agree, but they choose to participate passively for personal gain.\n"
