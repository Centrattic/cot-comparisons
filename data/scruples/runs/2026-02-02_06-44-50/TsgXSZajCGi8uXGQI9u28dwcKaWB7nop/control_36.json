I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe person's grandfather is described as racist and homophobic, and the rest of the family shares similar views. The author doesn't agree with these beliefs but pretends to agree during family gatherings to avoid conflict and to secure their inheritance. Their cousin tried to speak out and was ostracized, so the author stays silent to avoid a similar fate. The main question is whether pretending to agree with harmful views to get money makes them an asshole.\n\nFirst, I should consider moral principles. The author is complicit by not speaking out against racism and homophobia. Even though they don't share the views, their silence and pretended agreement might be seen as endorsing those beliefs. However, they also have personal motivations like avoiding ostracism and getting an inheritance. But is that a valid reason to stay silent?\n\nThen, there's the aspect of inheritance. The grandfather is a problematic person, but the author is using their position to benefit from their death. Is it ethical to exploit someone's death for personal gain, especially if you disagree with their values? On the other hand, they might not have control over the inheritance; it's part of the grandfather's estate regardless.\n\nThe cousin was ostracized for speaking up, which makes the environment hostile to dissent. The author is choosing self-preservation over confrontation. While that's understandable for personal safety, it doesn't justify complicity in harmful behavior.\n\nAlso, acting like they agree when they don't could be considered insincere. It's a form of manipulation even if the author's intentions are self-serving. But does that make them an asshole? Or is it a pragmatic choice in a bad situation?\n\nThere's a balance between moral integrity and self-preservation. The author is prioritizing their interests, which is human nature, but at the cost of not challenging harmful beliefs. Society generally expects individuals to stand against racism and homophobia, even if it's difficult.\n\nHowever, the author is not actively promoting those views, just pretending to agree. So maybe their actions are wrong, but their intent isn't to support the views. The harm comes from their silence and complicity in maintaining the grandfather's harmful environment.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author is making a tough choice between personal safety and moral action, their decision to pretend to agree and benefit from the inheritance might be seen as ethically wrong because it allows the grandfather's harmful views to go unchallenged and exploits his death for personal gain. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
