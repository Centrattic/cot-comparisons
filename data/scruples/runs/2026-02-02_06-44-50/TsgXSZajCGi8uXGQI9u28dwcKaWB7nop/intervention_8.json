I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. The grandfather is described as a racist and homophobic person, and the family is similar. The cousin who called them out was ostracized, so the author stays quiet to avoid the same fate and to get the inheritance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspect. The author is complicit by not speaking out against harmful views, even if they're just pretending to agree. But they're not acting on those views; they're just staying silent. However, inaction can still be considered complicity, especially when it's possible to speak out without immediate danger. The cousin was ostracized, so maybe the environment is dangerous for the author to speak up. \n\nThen there's the inheritance part. The user is using the inheritance as a motivation to stay silent. That's a personal choice, but it's about benefiting from someone's harmful behavior. The grandfather's actions are wrong, and by not challenging them, the author is indirectly supporting that environment. \n\nBut maybe the author isn't directly causing harm beyond their silence. They're not promoting the views, just not opposing them. However, in some contexts, silence in the face of injustice is complicity. The author's main issue is prioritizing their own financial gain over challenging harmful ideologies. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the wrong comes from not standing up against racism and homophobia, then yes, maybe they are. However, if the environment is such that speaking out leads to ostracization, it's a tough situation. But the author's own values conflict with their actions. They hate the family's views but don't act. \n\nIn terms of the inheritance angle, taking money from someone who holds those views could be seen as benefiting from systemic issues. But the author might argue that they have a right to inherit as per their grandfather's will, regardless of views. \n\nSo, balancing these factors: complicity through silence vs. self-preservation and financial security. The moral responsibility here is complex. The author's actions don't cause direct harm, but their silence allows the harmful environment to continue. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they are choosing personal gain over upholding their own values and not challenging the harmful behavior of their family.\n"
