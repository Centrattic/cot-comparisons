I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance.\n\nFirst, the author is in a family where the grandfather is openly bigoted and the rest of the family shares similar views. The cousin who challenged this was ostracized. The author keeps quiet to avoid being kicked out and to maintain their inheritance.\n\nThe key points here are the moral conflict between personal ethics and financial gain. The author doesn't hold those views but pretends to agree. Now, the question is whether that makes them an asshole. \n\nOn one hand, the author is complicit in perpetuating harmful ideologies by not speaking out, even if they disagree. This silence could be seen as endorsing the grandfather's behavior. On the other hand, the author is in a vulnerable position, possibly fearing loss of support or inheritance. \n\nBut complicity in hate speech, even passively, is a serious issue. The author's self-awareness of hating themselves for it suggests they recognize the moral conflict. However, the act of tolerating and agreeing outwardly while holding opposing views internally is a form of hypocrisy. \n\nInheritances are part of the equation here. Using someone's bigotry to secure financial gain might be seen as exploiting their flaws. The author is prioritizing self-interest over moral action, which is a common theme in these types of \"Am I the Asshole?\" questions. \n\nMost people would argue that standing up for one's values is more important than material gain, especially when it involves perpetuating harm. So, the author is in the wrong because they are complicit by silence and action, even if their intentions are self-preservation.\n"
