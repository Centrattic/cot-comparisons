I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure inheritance. Their grandfather is described as a racist, homophobic person, and the family is similar. The cousin who called them out was ostracized, so the author keeps quiet to avoid that fate and to keep the inheritance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral implications. The author is complicit in a way by not challenging these harmful views. Even though they personally disagree, they're not speaking up. That silence might mean they're indirectly supporting the grandfather's behavior. But they have a reason: fear of being ostracized and losing their inheritance. \n\nInheriting money from someone who holds prejudiced views is tricky. Some might argue that benefiting from someone's harmful beliefs is wrong, regardless of personal gain. Others might say it's about individual choice and survival\u2014especially if the family is toxic. The author isn't directly harming anyone by staying quiet, but they're also not promoting positive change. \n\nIs it their responsibility to call out the grandfather even if it risks their inheritance and safety? They mention the cousin was ostracized, so maybe the family isn't open to change. The author's decision could be seen as a self-preservation tactic. But on the other hand, by not challenging the grandfather, they might be enabling that behavior. \n\nLegally, there's no wrong in inheriting money, but morally, it's a gray area. The author is conflicted and feels bad about it, which suggests they have some moral reservations. The key point is whether pretending to agree is a form of complicity. \n\nI think there's a balance here. While the author's actions are understandable given the family dynamics, they are still complicit by not speaking out. However, they aren't actively spreading the hatred, just staying silent. The fact that they hate the views and feel conflicted may mitigate their responsibility. \n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, the act of pretending to agree with harmful beliefs for personal gain (inheritance) could be seen as wrong. They're choosing self-interest over standing up for what they believe is right. However, the alternative is risking their own well-being and losing the inheritance. It's a tough spot, but the question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nI'm leaning towards yes (A), because they are complicit in allowing harmful views to go unchallenged for personal gain. Even if they don't agree, their silence and pretense support the status quo. However, the context of family dynamics and fear of ostracism complicates it. But morally, they are choosing to benefit from someone's harmful beliefs, which is ethically questionable. So probably answer A.\n"
