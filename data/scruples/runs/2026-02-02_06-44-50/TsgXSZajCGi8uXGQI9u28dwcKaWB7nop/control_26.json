I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The person is clearly uncomfortable with their grandfather's and family's bigoted views but is choosing to stay silent and pretend to agree to avoid conflict and maintain access to inheritance. The cousin was ostracized for speaking out, so the person is in a tough spot.\n\nOn one hand, the person isn't actually holding those views; they're just faking agreement. They're not perpetuating the harmful rhetoric directly. However, by staying silent, they might be enabling the harmful environment. That's a tricky point. In some ethical frameworks, complicity is a factor. If you have the power to challenge harmful behavior but choose not to, you could be seen as complicit. But in this case, the person is in a vulnerable position\u2014family dynamics and fear of losing inheritance are significant pressures.\n\nThe other angle is the intention to inherit money. The person isn't in the wrong for wanting to secure what might be legally theirs. However, the means of doing so involve deception and moral compromise. The question is whether the ends justify the means here. Some might argue that the person is being pragmatic, while others might see it as morally wrong to feign agreement with harmful ideologies.\n\nI should also consider the impact on the person's own values. They're struggling with self-loathing, which indicates internal conflict. Ethically, living in a way that contradicts one's values can lead to personal distress, which is another negative consequence.\n\nBut then again, the person isn't actively spreading the hate; they're just not challenging it. The line between complicity and passive behavior is important here. If the person were actively endorsing it, that's different. However, passive agreement might not be as blameworthy as active participation, especially in a context where speaking out leads to ostracism.\n\nLegal inheritance is another factor. If the person is legally entitled to the inheritance, then their actions might be seen as a strategic move to protect their rights. But if the inheritance is conditional on adopting those views, it's a different scenario. The question doesn't mention legal conditions, so it's unclear. However, the person's justification is based on the family's behavior towards the cousin, implying that they have to navigate a hostile environment.\n\nIn conclusion, while the person is making a morally compromised choice by not confronting their grandfather's views, their primary motive is self-preservation and securing a legal inheritance. Whether they're in the wrong depends on the ethical perspective. Some might argue that they're in the wrong for enabling the harmful environment, while others might see it as a necessary compromise given the circumstances. But given the context, I think the answer leans towards them not being in the wrong (B), as they're not actively promoting the harmful views, just avoiding confrontation to protect their interests.\n"
