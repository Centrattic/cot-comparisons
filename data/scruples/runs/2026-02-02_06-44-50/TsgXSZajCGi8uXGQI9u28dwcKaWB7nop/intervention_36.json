I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. The author's family is described as having similar views, and there's a mention of a cousin who was ostracized for speaking out. The author stays silent to avoid being kicked out and losing the inheritance, which they see as a \"pinata\" to get money after the grandfather dies.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the moral implications of pretending to hold harmful views versus the practical benefit of inheritance. The author isn't actively promoting racism or homophobia; they're merely not speaking out against it. They're in a family environment where dissent leads to ostracization, so they choose self-preservation. \n\nBut morally, is tolerating and not challenging harmful behavior considered wrong? The author isn't acting on their grandfather's views, but their silence could be seen as complicity. However, they are not contributing to the harm beyond passive agreement. The cousin's experience shows the cost of speaking out, so the author's decision might be a calculated choice to avoid direct harm to themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, using someone's prejudiced views for personal gain could be seen as exploitative. The author benefits from the grandfather's beliefs without openly condemning them, which might be viewed as a form of hypocrisy. Yet, if the author were to speak out, they might lose the inheritance and risk their own well-being. \n\nEthically, this is a tough call. Some might argue that the author is prioritizing their financial gain over standing up for what they believe is right, which is a form of moral compromise. Others might see it as a necessary survival tactic in a hostile environment. The question is whether the ends justify the means. \n\nConsidering the scenario, the author is not actively participating in the harmful behavior but is complicit by silence. However, the broader moral responsibility for the grandfather's views isn't the author's to bear. They are not creating the environment but navigating it. The inheritance is tied to the grandfather's death, which the author doesn't control. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions are morally ambiguous, the primary wrongdoing lies with the grandfather and family for their harmful views. The author's choice to remain silent is a difficult one, balancing self-interest against personal ethics. Since the author isn't acting immorally beyond passive complicity, the answer might lean towards them not being in the wrong. But there's a case to be made that exploiting someone's prejudices for personal gain is ethically problematic. However, given the context of potential ostracization and the cousin's experience, the author's decision is more about self-preservation than active exploitation. Therefore, the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
