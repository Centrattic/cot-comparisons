I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. The question is presented as an AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is in a family where the grandfather and some relatives hold harmful views. The cousin was ostracized for challenging these views, so the author stays silent to avoid losing inheritance. They admit to feeling guilty but justify it by the potential financial gain.\n\nThe core issue here is whether the author is morally wrong for faking agreement with these views to gain money. On one hand, the author is complicit in enabling harmful ideologies by not challenging them. Even though they don't share the views, their silence and feigned agreement might perpetuate the grandfather's harmful behavior. On the other hand, they're acting out of self-preservation and financial interest, which some might argue is understandable, but it doesn't excuse the complicity.\n\nI should consider ethical perspectives. From a deontological standpoint, lying or pretending to agree with something one finds morally wrong could be considered wrong in itself. From a consequentialist view, the outcomes matter\u2014by not challenging the grandfather, they allow harmful speech to continue, which affects others negatively. However, the author isn't directly causing harm beyond their silence.\n\nThere's also the aspect of family dynamics. The cousin was ostracized for speaking out, making the author's position more precarious. But that doesn't necessarily make the author right for remaining silent. It's a complex situation where personal ethics clash with practical concerns.\n\nThe author's justification is that they need the inheritance, implying that the money might be important for their future. However, accepting money from someone whose values they despise could lead to internal conflict and moral compromise. It's a trade-off between financial security and ethical integrity.\n\nIn similar AITA scenarios, people often get called out for enabling bad behavior even if they have their own reasons. The act of pretending to agree could be seen as insincere and harmful, especially if it allows the grandfather to continue his harmful rhetoric without consequence.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the author's situation is difficult, their actions\u2014faking agreement and silence in the face of bigotry\u2014likely make them complicit in the harm caused by their grandfather's views. Therefore, the answer might lean towards them being in the wrong.\n"
