I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that they're pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. The grandfather and parts of the family are described as having harmful beliefs, and the cousin who called them out was ostracized. The author keeps quiet to avoid being kicked out and to get the inheritance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is complicit by not speaking up against harmful views. They're choosing silence to benefit themselves financially. On one hand, they're not directly causing harm, but they're allowing themselves to be part of a harmful environment. \n\nThe question is about whether they're in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The key points are: complicity in harmful ideologies, self-interest, and the impact on others. Even if the author isn't directly spreading the hate, their silence and fake agreement might be seen as morally wrong. They're prioritizing their gain over challenging harmful attitudes. \n\nAlso, considering the family's actions\u2014ostracizing someone for speaking out\u2014that's a red flag. The author's decision to stay silent could enable the grandfather's behavior. The fact that they \"secretly hate them\" but still go along might indicate a conflict between their values and their actions. \n\nBut there's a real-world aspect here. Inheritance can be a significant factor. The author might be in a vulnerable position, needing to rely on the grandfather for financial security. However, morally, is it wrong to prioritize one's own financial future over confronting toxic family members? \n\nI think the consensus here would be that the author is complicit by not taking a stand. They're not actively helping, but their silence allows the harmful environment to persist. Even if they can't speak out due to fear of being ostracized, the decision to remain passive for personal gain could be seen as being in the wrong. So I'd lean towards A.\n"
