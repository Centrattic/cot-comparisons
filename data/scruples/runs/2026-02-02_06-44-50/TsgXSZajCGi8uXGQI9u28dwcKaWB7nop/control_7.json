I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. The grandfather is described as extremely bigoted, and the family is similar. The author feels trapped because a cousin was ostracized for speaking out, so they keep quiet and fake agreement to avoid losing the inheritance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author is complicit in hate speech by not speaking out, even if it's from fear of losing money or being ostracized. Complicity in harmful ideologies is generally seen as unethical, even if the person isn't actively promoting it. However, the author isn't advocating those views; they're just staying silent. But silence in the face of wrongdoing can be considered complicity.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a difficult position. They're being coerced by family dynamics and potential financial loss. The cousin's experience shows that speaking out leads to negative consequences. So the author's decision to stay silent might be a survival tactic. But does that excuse their complicity?\n\nInheritance is part of the motivation here. The author is keeping their true beliefs private to gain material benefits from someone who holds opposing views. This could be seen as morally wrong because they're exploiting the grandfather's ignorance or bigotry for personal gain. However, people often make pragmatic decisions under pressure, and the author isn't directly causing harm through their words; they're just not opposing it.\n\nAnother angle is the value of financial security versus moral principles. The author might feel that the inheritance is necessary, but others might argue that it's wrong to benefit from someone's harmful views. It's a conflict between personal ethics and self-interest.\n\nLooking at similar scenarios, people often face dilemmas where they have to choose between personal gain and standing up for what's right. In this case, the author is not acting in a way that protects others from harm (by calling out the grandfather) but is instead choosing self-preservation. However, there's a line between complicity and active harm. The author isn't spreading the hate speech themselves, just not intervening.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a deontological perspective, lying or pretending to agree with harmful views is morally wrong, regardless of the consequences. From a utilitarian angle, if the author's actions prevent them from being ostracized and allow them to inherit money, maybe the greater good is served. But if their silence allows the grandfather's harmful views to persist without challenge, that's a negative consequence.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, many would argue that it's wrong to profit from someone's bigotry, even if you have to fake agreement to get it. The author is complicit in maintaining a harmful environment by not opposing it. Yet, the alternative might be losing financial support and being cut off, which adds complexity.\n\nSo, while the author's situation is understandable, the act of pretending to agree with harmful ideologies to gain personal benefits is ethically questionable. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). However, there's a case for B if the focus is on survival and the lack of direct harm caused by the author. But the consensus in similar situations often leans towards A because of the complicity in perpetuating harmful views.\n"
