I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is clearly opposed to these views but is faking agreement. That's one side of the coin. The other side is that they're doing it to get money and avoid ostracization. Their cousin was ostracized for speaking out, so the author is cautious. \n\nHmm. On one hand, the author isn't acting according to their beliefs, which could be seen as insincere or complicit by association. But on the other hand, they're not vocalizing harmful views and are maintaining a facade to protect themselves financially and socially. The question is whether the ends justify the means here.\n\nInheritance is a personal matter, but benefiting from someone's harmful beliefs might sit poorly with some. However, the author isn't actively promoting those views; they're just not challenging them. The moral dilemma is whether staying silent is acceptable when you disagree but are afraid of repercussions. \n\nI think society often values honesty and standing up for one's beliefs, but it's also understanding that fear of consequences can be a powerful deterrent. So the author is in a tough spot. But morally, is lying by omission about their true beliefs to gain an inheritance wrong? It might depend on context. If the author is complicit in any action that harms others, that's a different story. But here, they're just not speaking out. \n\nSo, the answer could be A (they are in the wrong) because they are allowing harmful ideas to persist by not challenging them, even if they don't act on them. Alternatively, B (they are not in the wrong) because they're protecting themselves and not directly causing harm. I think the key is that they aren't acting against their beliefs, just not acting in line with them. The act of pretending to agree could be seen as a personal moral compromise, but the consequences of their actions (keeping money away from someone who holds those views) might be viewed differently. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the wrong is about being insincere or complicit, then maybe A. If the wrong is about taking the money, then perhaps B. The user's own thought is that they are in the wrong, so I need to consider that. I think the author's actions are ethically ambiguous, but leaning towards A because they are passively enabling the grandfather's views by not challenging them, even if they don't act directly. However, some might argue that the author isn't causing direct harm. \n\nBut the core issue is that the author is using their grandfather's harmful beliefs to secure their own benefit without confronting the issue. That could be seen as exploiting the situation for personal gain, which is a moral issue. Therefore, the answer might be A. But maybe not, because they aren't directly causing harm. It's a tough call. I think the answer is A because the author is morally compromising by not standing against their grandfather's views for personal gain.\n"
