I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is complicit by not speaking out against harmful and offensive views. They mention that their cousin was ostracized for challenging the grandfather, so there's a risk involved. But the author is choosing silence to protect their own interests, including inheritance. \n\nNow, inheritance is a personal matter, but the question is about being in the wrong. The grandfather's views are clearly harmful, and the author is enabling that environment by staying silent. Even though they hate the views, their actions (smiling and nodding) might be seen as tacit approval. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they're not perpetuating the views; they're just not speaking out for self-preservation. But complicity can still be considered wrong because it allows the harmful behavior to continue. Also, looking at the grandfather as a \"pi\u00f1ata\" for money seems opportunistic, which could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nThere's also the aspect of family dynamics. The author is in a vulnerable position, especially with the cousin's experience. They might be protecting themselves from ostracism. However, the moral responsibility to not support or enable racism and homophobia is significant. \n\nIn ethical terms, even if the author isn't directly spreading hate, their silence in the face of injustice can be considered complicity. The question is whether complicity in silence is being in the wrong. Many would argue that it is, especially when it comes to issues as serious as racism and homophobia. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's actions, while understandable from a self-preservation standpoint, contribute to the continuation of harmful ideologies. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
