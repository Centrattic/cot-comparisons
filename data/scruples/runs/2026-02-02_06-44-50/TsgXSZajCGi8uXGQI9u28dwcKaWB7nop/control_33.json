I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's grandfather is described as racist and homophobic, and the family is similar. The author disagrees with these views but pretends to agree to avoid being ostracized like their cousin and to secure the inheritance. They feel conflicted but are prioritizing their own interests.\n\nSo, the question is whether this makes the author an asshole. The key points here are the author's actions versus their intentions. On one hand, they're complicit in harmful beliefs by not speaking out and even pretending to agree. On the other hand, they're not actively spreading the hate; they're just staying quiet for self-preservation. \n\nEthically, there's a debate between personal gain versus upholding one's moral values. If someone believes in equality but doesn't act against their family's harmful beliefs to avoid consequences, is that wrong? Some might say that by staying silent, they're enabling the harmful environment. Others might argue that the author is acting in self-interest, which is a natural human behavior, especially when facing potential loss of inheritance and social standing.\n\nHowever, the author isn't just staying silent; they're actively pretending to agree. That's a form of insincere agreement, which could be seen as deceptive. But deception for self-preservation is a common dilemma. The cousin who called out the grandfather got ostracized, so the author might feel that taking a different approach is necessary to avoid harm.\n\nIn terms of morality, many would argue that one's personal ethics shouldn't be compromised, even if it means losing out on something. But others might say that the author isn't causing direct harm beyond complicity, and their actions don't actively hurt others, just avoid conflict. \n\nThe inheritance aspect adds another layer. If the money is tied to someone's harmful legacy, some might argue that accepting it is a form of benefiting from that legacy. However, the author isn't actively supporting the grandfather; they're just not opposing it. \n\nI think the consensus here would lean towards the author being in the wrong because they're complicit by pretense, even if they don't actively support the views. However, there's also a strong argument that the author is acting in self-interest under pressure, which complicates the judgment. But the act of pretending to agree with harmful beliefs is a form of insincerity and moral compromise, which could be seen as wrong.\n"
