I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the granddad is described as a racist and homophobic person, and the family shares similar views. The author doesn't agree with these views but keeps quiet to avoid being ostracized, like their cousin who was shut out for speaking up. The author's motivation is both self-preservation and the desire to inherit money. They feel conflicted but see it as necessary for their future.\n\nNow, the key question is about morality. The author isn't actively supporting the views, just pretending to agree. They're not participating in harmful actions but are maintaining silence. But is that enough? Some might say that by feigning agreement, they're complicit in the hate speech. Others might argue that they're not causing direct harm and are acting out of self-interest.\n\nThe ethical dilemma here is between personal ethics and survival/financial gain. The author isn't promoting the bad views; they\u2019re just not challenging them. However, by doing so, they might be enabling the grandfather's behavior. But the alternative is risking their inheritance and social standing in the family, which could have real consequences.\n\nAlso, the author is being honest about their own feelings\u2014they hate the views but can't speak up. That shows they have a moral stance, even if they\u2019re not acting on it. But is pretending to agree a form of dishonesty or hypocrisy that makes them an asshole?\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, people often face tough choices in family dynamics where they have to compromise their values for practical reasons. The author isn't physically harming anyone, just staying silent. However, silence in the face of hatred can be seen as complicity, which some might argue is a moral failing.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author speaks up, they risk losing the inheritance and possibly being ostracized. Since the cousin was already punished for speaking out, the author is realistically assessing the risks and acting in their self-interest. That's a pragmatic choice, but does it make them morally wrong?\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether one values personal ethics above all else or takes a more situational approach. If the author is not actively contributing to harm beyond passive agreement, maybe they\u2019re not in the wrong. But if the mere act of pretending to agree is considered complicity, then they might be. However, given the context of fear and prior consequences for dissent, it's a gray area.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't taking active steps to support the harmful views and are instead preserving their own position. While their choice might not align with ideal moral standards, it's a realistic response to a harmful environment without direct harm to others. Therefore, they might not be in the wrong.\n"
