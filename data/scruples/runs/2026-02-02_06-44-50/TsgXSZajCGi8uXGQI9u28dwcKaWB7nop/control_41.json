I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author's grandfather is described as a racist and homophobic individual, and the author is part of a family where similar views are held. The cousin who challenged these views was ostracized, leading the author to keep quiet. The author's main motivations are to avoid being kicked out of the family and to secure their inheritance, which they see as a financial gain after their grandfather's death.\n\nThe key ethical points here are: deception, complicity in harmful ideologies, and the moral implications of benefiting from someone's prejudiced views. The author isn't just passive; they're actively pretending to agree, which could be seen as complicity. Even if they don't agree, by feigning agreement, they might be enabling the grandfather's harmful behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions are driven by self-preservation and financial security. They might not be directly causing harm but are avoiding confrontation in a hostile environment. However, ethical considerations often weigh on the intent and the consequences. Pretending to endorse harmful beliefs could be considered morally wrong, regardless of the personal gain. \n\nThere's also the aspect of inheritance. The grandfather's wealth is tied to his prejudiced worldview, and accepting it under false pretenses brings up questions about the legitimacy of such inheritance. Some might argue that one should not benefit from someone's hatred, even indirectly.\n\nBut then, is the author complicit by association? Since they don't hold the views, their complicity is through silence and pretense. In ethical terms, this might be seen as a lesser form of complicity compared to active participation, but it's still a form of enabling. \n\nThe cousin's experience shows the family's intolerance for dissent, which complicates the situation. The author might be in a difficult position where speaking out leads to ostracization or losing the inheritance. However, ethical frameworks often prioritize standing against injustice over personal gain. \n\nIn many moral systems, lying or deception for personal benefit, especially when it involves upholding harmful ideologies, is considered wrong. The author's justification of \"selfish\" reasons (to avoid losing money) might be seen as prioritizing financial gain over ethical integrity. \n\nHowever, human behavior is complex. The author's self-hatred for their actions indicates internal conflict, which suggests they recognize the immorality. Still, the external actions\u2014pretending to agree with harmful views\u2014could be seen as ethically problematic. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions are understandable given the family dynamics and potential consequences, the act of feigning agreement with racist and homophobic views to gain inheritance is ethically questionable. The author's moral stance versus their actions creates a conflict where the actions may be deemed wrong regardless of intent.\n"
