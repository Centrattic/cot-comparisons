I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. They don't share these views themselves but are putting up with it to avoid being ostracized and to get the money. The cousin who spoke out was shut out, so they keep quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethics here. The author is complicit in a harmful environment by not speaking out, even though they disagree. But they're also in a difficult position where their family is toxic. The grandfather's views are clearly wrong, and the author is trying to avoid conflict and protect their own interests.\n\nIs pretending to agree a form of lying, which is ethically wrong? Well, lying can be considered wrong if it's causing harm. But in this case, the author isn't directly causing harm; they're just not correcting the grandfather's harmful statements. However, by staying silent and nodding, they might be enabling the grandfather's behavior, which perpetuates hate. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions are self-preservation. They might fear losing inheritance and being ostracized, which are significant personal stakes. The cousin's experience shows the consequences of speaking out, so the author's silence could be a strategic choice to avoid those negative outcomes.\n\nThere's a balance between personal ethics and practical survival. The author's internal conflict is evident\u2014they hate the views but act against their beliefs. Ethically, some might argue that one should stand up for their values regardless of consequences. Others might say that in a harmful environment, self-preservation is necessary, and moral responsibility doesn't require martyrdom.\n\nBut where does the line get drawn between personal gain and moral integrity? If someone is complicit in a harmful system by not acting, does that make them complicit? The grandfather's actions are hurtful, and the author's silence might be seen as tacit approval. However, the author isn't actively participating in the harm beyond agreeing verbally; they're not perpetuating the harm themselves.\n\nIn terms of the inheritance, the author is taking advantage of a situation where the grandfather's assets will be passed on. If the inheritance is tied to the grandfather's unethical behavior, is the author justified in benefiting from that? This touches on the idea of accepting wealth from someone who has caused harm. But since the author isn't involved in the grandfather's harmful actions, just benefiting from his death, it's a bit complex.\n\nUltimately, it's a tough call. The author is in a morally ambiguous situation. They avoid direct harm but enable the grandfather's environment. While their actions are pragmatic, they do compromise their values for personal gain. However, the ethical dilemma is whether staying silent is worse than the potential consequences of speaking out. Given the cousin's experience, it's a risky choice to speak up, so the author's decision might be seen as a survival tactic rather than a moral failure.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author is in a difficult position, but the act of pretending to agree with harmful views for personal gain could be seen as ethically questionable. However, the context of fear and family dynamics complicates the judgment. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong, but with nuance.\n"
