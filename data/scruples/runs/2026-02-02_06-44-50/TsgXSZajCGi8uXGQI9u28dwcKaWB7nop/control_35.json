I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author describes their grandfather as someone who frequently uses racist and homophobic slurs. The family is similar in their views, and there's a cousin who was ostracized for calling them out. The author, to avoid being kicked out and losing the inheritance, pretends to agree with these harmful beliefs. They feel conflicted but are motivated by the desire to inherit money when the grandfather dies.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical implications. The author is not actually holding these views but is faking agreement. While they personally oppose these views, they are complicit in maintaining a harmful environment by not challenging it. However, they are not actively promoting the views, just remaining silent or nodding along. \n\nBut then, is it wrong to prioritize personal gain (inheritance) over moral principles? The author's actions could be seen as morally compromising because they are allowing harmful rhetoric to continue without intervention. Even if they don't act on the views themselves, their silence might enable further harm. On the other hand, they are not directly causing harm; they're just not stopping it. \n\nAnother angle is the concept of moral responsibility. By staying silent, they might be contributing to a culture where discrimination is tolerated. However, the fear of ostracization and losing the inheritance is a real concern. The cousin's experience shows the consequences of speaking out, which adds context to the author's decision. \n\nBut does that make it excusable? Maybe not. The author is choosing personal financial gain over standing up for what they believe is right. They might argue it's a matter of self-preservation, but others might see it as morally wrong to condone such views, even passively. \n\nAlso, the author looks at the grandfather as a \"pinata\" for money, which implies a transactional view. That could be seen as selfish, but it's a common human tendency to act in self-interest, especially under threat. However, the fact that the grandfather's money was earned with such harmful views complicates things. Is it right to benefit from someone's wealth if they've acted immorally?\n\nIn summary, there's a conflict between self-interest and moral integrity. The author's actions don't directly cause harm, but their inaction allows ongoing harm. The ethical stance here is debatable. Some might say the author is in the right because they are not harming others and are protecting their own interests. Others might argue that by not challenging harmful views, they are complicit and thus in the wrong. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author is actively participating in the harm. Since they are just pretending to agree without actually holding the views, it's not as bad as if they were promoting them. But still, their silence and complicity could be seen as morally questionable. However, given the risks involved (ostracization, losing inheritance), the decision might be understandable. But the fact that they are using this as a means to an end (getting money) introduces a layer of self-interest that could be seen as wrong regardless of the circumstances.\n"
