I don't think the man has gone 15 minutes without shouting a racist or homophobic slur in all the time I've known him.  A good deal of my family are similar.  I don't hold any such views on the world, and I secretly hate them all for acting this way, but I'd never tell them because the last person to call any of them out on this bullshit (my older cousin) has since been ostracized by my grandfather for daring to disagree with the family patriarch and say such things to him.  So I keep quiet so I don't get kicked out, and selfishly, so I don't lose the inheritance that I am currently in line to get when my grandfather dies.\n\nSo since the family meets up and spends a lot of time at my grandfather's house I have to sit around and smile and nod whenever he tells us about how minorities are raping and pillaging at the border, and how all gay men are pedophiles.  Part of me hates myself for doing it, but the other part of me realizes his health has gotten so poor recently that he probably only has a year or two left in him and I can tolerate it long enough to get that money.\n\nSo am I an asshole for passively pretending to be racist in order to get my racist grandfather's money?  Also am I an asshole for basically looking at this man as a pinata that will eventually drop money for me?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they're pretending to agree with their grandfather's racist and homophobic views to secure an inheritance. The grandfather is described as a racist, homophobic person, and the family is similar. The cousin who called them out was ostracized. The author is hiding their true beliefs, enduring the grandfather's slurs, and waiting for the inheritance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author isn't actually supporting those views, just pretending. They're not acting on the views, just nodding along. But they are complicit in a way by not challenging the grandfather. However, the cousin was ostracized for speaking up, so maybe the author is avoiding conflict to protect their financial future.\n\nOn one hand, the author is choosing to remain silent to avoid losing the inheritance. They hate the views but don't want to risk it. On the other hand, they're not actively supporting the views, just not opposing them. There's a moral dilemma here between personal ethics and financial gain.\n\nIs it wrong to prioritize money over standing up for one's beliefs? Well, the author is sacrificing their integrity for financial security. That could be seen as wrong because it shows a willingness to compromise on their values for personal gain. However, they might argue that they're not causing harm other than not speaking out, which is different from actively participating.\n\nBut complicity can still be considered a form of wrongdoing. By not challenging the grandfather, they might be enabling the toxic environment, albeit not actively. The cousin was punished for speaking out, so the author is avoiding punishment by not doing the same. It's a tough situation where they're caught between family and values.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they are in the wrong, it's because they're choosing to benefit from someone's harmful views without challenging them. If not, it's because they're protecting their interests in a hostile environment.\n\nI think the answer here leans towards A (they are in the wrong) because they're complicit by not speaking up, even if they don't act on the views. It's about the moral responsibility to oppose harmful beliefs, even if it's hard. However, the context of facing ostracization complicates it. But overall, the author is prioritizing financial gain over their values, which many might see as wrong.\n"
