During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 7-year engagement with a son, and the author is considering leaving because her fianc\u00e9 can't cut off contact with an old friend, even after multiple promises.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The couple has been together for 7 years, which is a long time. They have a child, so this is a major life decision. The main issue is the fianc\u00e9's continued contact with a girl he's known for most of his life. They broke up briefly before, and after getting back together, the author expected him to cut ties, which he initially did but then resumed. The author snooped and found he was still interacting with her on social media, even liking her posts. After confrontations, he seemed to comply but then repeated the behavior. The final straw was unblocking them again.\n\nSo, the author is contemplating leaving because of ongoing dishonesty and inability to respect her boundaries. The question is whether she's in the wrong. Cheating isn't proven, but there's consistent emotional unfaithfulness. In many relationships, trust and respect are foundational. If one partner can't respect the other's boundaries after multiple warnings, that's a significant issue. The author's actions (snooping) might be seen as overstepping, but given the context of repeated betrayals, it's understandable. The fianc\u00e9's pattern of lying and not following through on promises indicates a lack of commitment to the relationship. The author prioritizing her emotional well-being by leaving isn't wrong. So, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
