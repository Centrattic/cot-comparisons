During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with her fianc\u00e9 because he keeps staying in contact with another girl, even though there's no evidence of cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple has been together for seven years and has a child. They broke up once before, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for a long time. After they reconciled, the author expected him to cut contact with her. He did delete her but later kept reconnecting, including liking her sister's posts. The author found out multiple times, and each time he promised to stop, but it kept happening. Finally, she ended the relationship because she couldn't trust him anymore.\n\nThe main issue here is trust. The author feels betrayed by his ongoing contact, which she perceives as a violation of their commitment. Even though there's no proof of cheating, the consistent behavior might erode trust. The fianc\u00e9's actions show a pattern of not following through on his promises, which is a problem in a relationship. The author might believe that a healthy relationship requires mutual respect and boundaries, which he hasn't respected.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the fianc\u00e9 isn't cheating, just maintaining contact with someone he's known for a long time. However, the repeated pattern of reconnecting and the defensive reactions suggest that he's not fully committed to the relationship as per her expectations. The author's decision to leave is based on her inability to trust him anymore, which is a valid reason for ending a relationship, especially when there's a child involved. The stability and mental health of the family could be at risk if trust isn't present.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship because her feelings and need for trust are legitimate. The fianc\u00e9's actions, while not necessarily cheating, have caused consistent issues that she can't overlook. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
