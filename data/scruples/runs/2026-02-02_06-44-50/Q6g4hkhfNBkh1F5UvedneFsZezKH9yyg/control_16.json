During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is considering whether they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. They have a child together. The main issue is that the fianc\u00e9 has been in contact with another girl he's known for a long time. The author found out through snooping because they were feeling distant. The fianc\u00e9 didn't delete the girl initially, then after confrontation, he did, but later the author found out he was still interacting with her and even the girl's sister. The fianc\u00e9 claims it was accidental re-likes. Now, the author ended the relationship, and the question is if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the ongoing contact despite promises to stop. The author felt betrayed and couldn't trust their partner. The fianc\u00e9's actions show a pattern of not following through on commitments, which is a big red flag in a relationship. The author had evidence of continued contact, even after multiple confrontations. While there's no proof of cheating, the repeated behavior might be enough for the author to leave, especially since trust is a crucial component in a relationship. The fianc\u00e9's defensiveness and inability to cut off contact could indicate emotional unavailability or emotional infidelity. The author had to make a tough decision based on their feelings and the situation. Since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer is likely B (No) because the author acted based on their partner's consistent breaches of trust, even if they didn't have proof of cheating. The decision to leave in such circumstances is often seen as a personal choice and not wrong.\n"
