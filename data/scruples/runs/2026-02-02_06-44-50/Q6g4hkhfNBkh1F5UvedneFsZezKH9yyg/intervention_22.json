During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a 7-year engagement and a 6-year-old son. They broke up briefly for a month 3 years ago, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for a long time. After getting back together, the author expected him to cut contact with her. But he didn't delete her from social media until she found out. Then, even after he deleted her, he ended up liking her photos again and even the girl's sister. The author confronted him multiple times, and each time he promised to cut contact, but it kept happening. Now, the author left him because they can't trust him, even though there's no proof of cheating.\n\nFirst, considering the author's perspective, they have a right to feel betrayed. The fianc\u00e9 didn't follow through on his promises to cut contact, which led to a loss of trust. Infidelity isn't just about physical cheating; emotional or social infidelity can be just as damaging in a relationship. The fact that he kept re-adding the girl and her sister suggests a lack of commitment to the relationship, even if there's no explicit cheating mentioned.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might argue that he didn't cheat and that the author is being overly controlling. However, the author has a right to set boundaries, especially since they have a child together. The repeated breaches of trust, despite promises to stop, are significant. The author's decision to end the engagement could be seen as a self-respecting choice to prioritize their own mental health and their son's stability.\n\nBut the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Maybe they believe that the author's actions (snooping, not giving the fianc\u00e9 the benefit of the doubt) were not justified. However, the fianc\u00e9's actions of re-adding the girl and her sister after repeated assurances might outweigh that. The key here is the pattern of behavior indicating a lack of commitment, which justifies the author's decision.\n\nSo, considering all that, it's more about whether the author had a valid reason. Since the fianc\u00e9 repeatedly broke trust despite promises, the author's choice to leave seems justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
