During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a seven-year engagement where the author is considering leaving their fianc\u00e9 because of ongoing issues with him maintaining contact with a girl he's known for a long time. \n\nFirst, the main points from the scenario: They broke up for a month three years ago, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to this girl. After getting back together, the author expected him to cut off contact, which he initially did. But later, the author found out he was still in contact through social media, liking her posts, etc. The author snooped and found this, leading to confrontations. The fianc\u00e9 promised to delete her each time, but it kept happening again. The latest incident is that he unblocked both her and her sister, which the author found out and decided to leave.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user wants a yes or no answer based on whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nLet me break it down. The key factors here are the fianc\u00e9's actions and the author's response. The author has evidence that the fianc\u00e9 hasn't followed through on promises to cut contact with another woman, even after multiple confrontations. The fianc\u00e9 might be emotionally involved or at least maintaining inappropriate contact, which can be a deal-breaker in a relationship. The author has a child with him, so the stability of their relationship is important for the child's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 claims that some of the likes were accidental, like the sister's posts. But the author has observed a pattern over time, where despite assurances, the contact persists. The author's decision to leave is based on trust issues and the other person's inability to respect the author's boundaries. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner repeatedly breaches the other's trust, even without physical cheating, it can be grounds for ending the relationship. The author isn't accusing of cheating but of maintaining emotional ties that cause pain and distrust. Since the author has a right to expect exclusivity and respect in the relationship, and the fianc\u00e9 hasn't been able to meet those expectations despite multiple chances, the author's decision to leave seems justified. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
