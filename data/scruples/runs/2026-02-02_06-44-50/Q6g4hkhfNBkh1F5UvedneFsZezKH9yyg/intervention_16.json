During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for ending a 7-year engagement because their fianc\u00e9 is contacting an ex. The author found out that the fianc\u00e9 continued to interact with a girl he's known for a long time, even after breaking up before. They had arguments, the fianc\u00e9 promised to cut ties, but the author kept finding more contact. Now, the author is leaving because they can't trust him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together for 7 years and has a child. Trust is a big factor here. The fianc\u00e9 had a previous breakup where he was in contact with this girl, then after getting back together, he wasn't entirely truthful about cutting contact. The author snooped and found ongoing interactions, including likes on social media, which the fianc\u00e9 tried to hide. Even after he promised to delete her, the author found she was still there. Then, recently, there were likes on the girl's sister's posts. The fianc\u00e9 claims it was accidental, but the author doesn't believe him. Now, the fianc\u00e9 unblocked both the girl and her sister, which the author sees as intentional.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong to end the engagement. The main points are betrayal of trust, repeated promises broken, and the fianc\u00e9's actions suggesting he's not committed to the relationship. The author has evidence of ongoing contact, even if not cheating. The fianc\u00e9's behavior might be emotionally unfaithful, even if not physically. The author has tried to address it multiple times, but the fianc\u00e9 keeps failing to follow through. The author is in a hard position, dealing with a long-term partner who can't seem to respect boundaries. Ending the engagement might be their way of protecting themselves from further hurt.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship if they feel their trust is broken and the relationship is harming their well-being. The fianc\u00e9's actions, even if not cheating, show a lack of commitment and honesty. The author has the right to prioritize their own emotional health. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
