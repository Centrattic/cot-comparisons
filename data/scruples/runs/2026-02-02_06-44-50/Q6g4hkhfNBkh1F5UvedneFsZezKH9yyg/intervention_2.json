During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the original situation is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. The main issue is about the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl despite promises to cut off contact.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 had a history of keeping the girl on social media, even after arguments and promises to delete her. The author snoopied through the phone and found ongoing likes on the girl's pictures. The fianc\u00e9 would promise to remove her each time but failed. Then, the sister was also liked, and finally, the fianc\u00e9 unblocked both the girl and her sister. The author ends the relationship because of this, even without proof of cheating.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be wrong, but others might argue that maintaining contact with someone in a committed relationship is a red flag. The question is whether the author is justified in ending the relationship.\n\nFactors to consider: The fianc\u00e9's repeated failures to honor his promises, the ongoing contact despite being asked to stop, and the author's concern for their relationship's integrity. The author has a child with the fianc\u00e9, so trust and stability are crucial. Even without cheating, emotional infidelity or betrayal of trust could be a valid reason to leave. The author's actions (snooping) might be questionable, but the reason for doing so was to uncover breaches of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say the author is overreacting, but given the repeated issues and the fianc\u00e9's lack of commitment to fix the problem, the author's decision could be seen as justified. The key is whether the fianc\u00e9 respected the boundaries set by the author. If not, the author isn't necessarily wrong to leave.\n"
