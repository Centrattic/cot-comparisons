During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the person is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with her fianc\u00e9. The main issue is that he's been in contact with an ex-girlfriend and her sister despite promises to cut off contact. The author found evidence of him liking their social media posts and even unblocking them after previously blocking. But there's no mention of actual cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The relationship has been going on for 7 years, and they have a child together. That's a long time, so trust and communication are crucial. The fianc\u00e9 had a history of not following through on promises to cut off contact, which led the author to feel betrayed and eventually decide to leave. \n\nThe key points here are the repeated violations of trust. Even if it's not physical cheating, emotional infidelity can be a deal-breaker for many people. The author tried multiple times to address the issue, and each time the fianc\u00e9 either didn't comply or there were relapses. The fact that he went out of his way to unblock them again suggests a pattern of behavior that the author can't accept. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might claim he wasn't doing anything wrong, just maintaining old friendships. But the author's actions of snooping might come into play. However, given the circumstances, her concern is understandable, especially if she felt that his contact with the girl was inappropriate. \n\nThe question is whether ending the relationship is justified. Since the author has a child with the fianc\u00e9, this decision would have long-term implications. But if the trust is broken and there's a pattern of dishonesty, it's a valid reason to end things. The author's decision is based on her own feelings of being disrespected and the inability to trust her partner, which are personal but significant factors. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because her actions stem from a need to protect herself and her child from a relationship that's been troubled by her partner's behavior.\n"
