During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The main issue is about the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with an ex-girlfriend and her sister, even after promises to cut ties.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple has a 6-year-old son. They broke up briefly three years ago, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 talked to the girl. After getting back together, the author expected him to stop contact. There were repeated instances where the fianc\u00e9 didn't delete the girl from social media, even after being confronted. The author found likes on the girl's and her sister's posts, and recently, he unblocked them again.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should think about relationship boundaries and trust. In a long-term relationship, especially before marriage, trust is crucial. The fianc\u00e9 promised to cut contact multiple times but didn't follow through. The author felt the need to check his phone because of the secrecy involved\u2014blocking the author on social media to hide interactions. This could indicate a lack of transparency and respect for the author's feelings. \n\nEven if there's no actual cheating, maintaining contact and showing favoritism by liking the ex's posts but not the partner's could be seen as emotionally inappropriate. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 had to be confronted multiple times and kept breaking promises might have led the author to feel that the relationship isn't moving forward. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might argue that he wasn't cheating, just keeping a friendship. But in a committed relationship, what's considered acceptable contact can vary. The author's actions of checking the phone could be seen as a breach of privacy, but given the circumstances, it might be justified as a last resort to confirm if he was truthful.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's decision to leave based on broken promises and ongoing contact that caused trust issues seems reasonable. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
