During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The main issue seems to be about the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl he's known for a long time, despite promises to cut off contact.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they had a breakup a few years ago, during which the fianc\u00e9 started talking to this girl. After reconciling, the author expected him to stop contact. The fianc\u00e9 deleted her initially, but later, the author found out he was still following her on social media, liking her posts, and even the sister's. There were multiple confrontations where he promised to delete her, but it kept happening again. The latest incident was unblocking both the girl and her sister.\n\nNow, the key points here are about trust and boundaries in a relationship. The author felt that maintaining contact with this girl was a breach of trust, even if it didn't involve physical cheating. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, claims it's just friendship and that he's trying to cut off contact but keeps messing up. The author has children with him, which complicates things because of co-parenting responsibilities.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner repeatedly fails to respect the other's boundaries, it can lead to justified feelings of betrayal. The author has tried multiple times to address this, but the behavior keeps recurring. The fianc\u00e9's inability to follow through on his promises might indicate a deeper issue, like emotional attachment or lack of commitment. The author's decision to leave could stem from feeling that their needs for trust and respect aren't being met.\n\nHowever, without evidence of actual infidelity, some might argue that the author is overreacting. But given the repeated violations of agreed-upon boundaries and the emotional toll this takes, it's understandable why the author feels leaving is necessary for their well-being. The presence of a child adds another layer, but the author might be prioritizing their own mental health and setting a boundary that's essential for them.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to expect their partner to respect their boundaries, and when those are repeatedly broken despite promises, leaving could be a valid choice. The fianc\u00e9's actions, even if not physical cheating, have eroded trust, which is a fundamental part of a relationship. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
