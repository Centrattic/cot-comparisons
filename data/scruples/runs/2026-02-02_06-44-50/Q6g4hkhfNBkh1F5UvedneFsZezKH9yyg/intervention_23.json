During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the original story is in the wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9 after a 7-year relationship. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl that he's known for most of his life, even after the author asked him to cut ties. The author found evidence of ongoing contact, like likes on social media, and eventually left him. The question is whether she's wrong to do so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The couple has been together for seven years and has a child together. That's a long-term commitment. The fianc\u00e9 broke up with her once before and then got back together. During that break-up, he started talking to an old friend. When they reconciled, the author expected him to cut contact with her. He did delete her initially, but later she found out he was still in contact through social media, liking her posts, and even the sister's. The fianc\u00e9 gave various explanations, like accidentally re-liking or trying to unlike, but the author kept catching him. Finally, when she found he unblocked them again, she decided to leave.\n\nThe key points here are trust and respect in the relationship. The author felt betrayed because her partner couldn't cut off someone she saw as a problem, even after multiple promises to do so. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, might argue that he's just maintaining a friendship with someone he's known for a long time, even if it's frustrating for his partner. However, the repeated instances where he didn't follow through on his promises, despite confrontations and apologies, suggest a pattern of behavior that the author found unacceptable.\n\nIn a committed relationship, especially with a child involved, trust is crucial. If one partner is continuously violating the other's boundaries, even after being asked to stop, that's a significant issue. The author's decision to leave could be seen as a necessary step to protect her own well-being and the integrity of the relationship. The fact that there's no actual evidence of cheating might mitigate some of the severity, but the ongoing contact and the lies (or at least the failure to be fully transparent) can erode trust over time.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author was being overly controlling, especially since the fianc\u00e9 was only maintaining a friendship. But given the context of their long-term relationship and the fact that the author had specific concerns that weren't addressed, her actions might be seen as justified. The key is whether the fianc\u00e9 respected her boundaries. If he knew it was important for her to cut off contact and he kept doing it, that's a breach of trust.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author is not in the wrong. Her decision to leave is a response to ongoing issues of trust and respect, and she had the right to set boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
