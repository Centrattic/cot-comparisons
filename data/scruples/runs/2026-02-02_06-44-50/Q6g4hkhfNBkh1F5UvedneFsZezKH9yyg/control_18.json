During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for breaking up with their fianc\u00e9. The situation is that they've been together for 7 years, have a child, and there's been ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 contacting an old friend, a girl he knew for most of his life. The author discovered that even after promises to cut contact, the fianc\u00e9 kept liking her and her sister's social media posts, and recently unblocked them again.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The main issue is the fianc\u00e9's continued contact with another woman despite the author's insistence that he stop. There's no direct evidence of cheating, just ongoing contact that the author finds unacceptable. The author snooped through the phone, which might be a point of contention. However, given the context of a long-term relationship with trust issues, it's understandable why the author would feel the need to check.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's actions\u2014liking ex-girlfriend's pictures, not deleting her, unblocking her again\u2014show a pattern of not respecting the author's boundaries. Even if he claims it's accidental, the repeated nature suggests intentionality. The author felt that despite the fianc\u00e9's promises, he wasn't following through, leading to the decision to end the relationship.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's behavior is the main issue here. The author's response is based on the breach of trust and lack of respect for boundaries. While snooping might be questionable, the outcome is valid because the fianc\u00e9 didn't keep his word. The author isn't at fault for leaving when there's a pattern of betrayal, even if it's not outright cheating. The emotional impact of constant infidelity in communication is significant. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
