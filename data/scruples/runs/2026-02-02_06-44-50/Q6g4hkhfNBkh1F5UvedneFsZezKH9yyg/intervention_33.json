During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their 7-year fianc\u00e9. The situation involves ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl, which the author finds unacceptable. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple has been together for seven years and has a child. They broke up briefly before, and after getting back together, the author expected the fianc\u00e9 to cut off contact with this girl. Despite multiple confrontations and the fianc\u00e9 promising to do so, the contact continued. The author snooped and found instances of likes on social media, even after the fianc\u00e9 had supposedly blocked her. Finally, the fianc\u00e9 unblocked both the girl and her sister, leading the author to leave.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is wrong, but I need to evaluate independently. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's behavior seems to be a pattern of not respecting the author's boundaries. Even after multiple promises to delete the girl's contact, he continues to engage with her and her sister. There's no evidence of actual cheating, just ongoing contact that the author finds trust-breaking. The author's decision to leave is based on the inability to trust the fianc\u00e9 despite repeated issues. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner consistently violates the other's trust, even if it's not physical cheating, it can be a deal-breaker. The author has tried to address the issue through communication and confrontation, but the fianc\u00e9 hasn't followed through. The author's decision to end the relationship because of these breaches, even if there's no cheating, might be seen as justified given the lack of respect for boundaries. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author's snoopiness and the decision to leave without more concrete evidence (like actual cheating) could be seen as hasty. But given the pattern over years and the repeated failures to address the issue, it's understandable. The author is the parent and has a right to feel secure in the relationship. \n\nSo, considering the repeated violations of trust and the fianc\u00e9's inability or unwillingness to change, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for ending the relationship. The decision is based on the cumulative effect of these issues over time, not just one incident. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
