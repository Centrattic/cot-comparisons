During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The key points here are the ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl, despite promises to cut it off. The author found evidence of continued interactions, even after previous confrontations and promises to delete the contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. A seven-year relationship with a child is significant. The fianc\u00e9 had a history of not following through on promises to end the contact. The author tried multiple times to address this, but the issue kept resurfacing. The fianc\u00e9's actions included liking posts on social media, not deleting the girl even after being asked, and eventually unblocking her again. \n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but maybe not. The author did give multiple chances and tried to resolve the issue. The fianc\u00e9's behavior could be seen as a breach of trust, even if there's no actual cheating. The author's decision to leave might be justified due to the persistent lack of respect for boundaries and the ongoing emotional betrayal through maintaining contact. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author snooped through the phone, which isn't ideal. However, given the context of a serious relationship and having a child together, the author's concern about the fianc\u00e9's loyalty and commitment is understandable. The fianc\u00e9's inability to follow through on his promises might indicate a deeper issue, making the author's decision to leave reasonable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely that the author is not in the wrong. Their actions were a response to consistent breaches of trust and failed attempts to resolve the issue.\n"
