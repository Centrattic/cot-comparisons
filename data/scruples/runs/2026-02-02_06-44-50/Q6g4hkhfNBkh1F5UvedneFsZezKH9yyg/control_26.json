During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with their fianc\u00e9 because he kept staying in contact with another girl. The main question is whether the author (the person ending the relationship) is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for seven years and has a child. They broke up once before but got back together. The fianc\u00e9 (he) had been in contact with a girl he's known for a long time. The author (they) asked him to cut contact, which he initially did but then kept reconnecting despite promises. The author found out through snooping, which is a red flag. They confronted him multiple times, and he kept the contact despite assurances. The author finally leaves because they feel he doesn't respect their boundaries, even though there's no proof of cheating.\n\nNow, considering the arguments for and against the author being in the wrong. On one hand, snooping through the phone could be seen as a breach of trust. That might be a problem because privacy is important in a relationship. If the author didn't trust him, maybe there were other ways to address it. But on the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 repeatedly broke promises not to contact the girl, which is a serious issue. The author might feel that their trust is broken and that the relationship isn't healthy. The fact that there's no cheating but just ongoing contact might be a gray area. However, if the author felt that constant contact was a problem and the fianc\u00e9 couldn't respect that boundary, then leaving could be justified. \n\nAlso, the presence of a child complicates things. Ending the relationship might affect the child, but staying in an unhappy or trustless relationship can also have negative effects. The author might think that they can't be happy and thus can't model a healthy relationship for their son.\n\nBut then again, maybe the author acted impulsively after snooping. Snooping isn't a great approach, and that could be seen as contributing to the breakdown. The fianc\u00e9 might have felt disrespected and that led to his defensive behavior. However, the repeated violations of the agreed-upon boundaries (blocking the girl, etc.) are on his side. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? For choosing to leave because of these boundary issues, maybe not. The fianc\u00e9's actions were a breach of trust and promises. The author might have felt that after multiple chances, it's time to end things. The act of leaving could be justified as a last resort after repeated failures to maintain the boundary they considered important. However, the act of snooping might reflect a lack of trust or communication, which could be a problem. But in the context of the repeated violations, the author's decision might be seen as reasonable. So, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
