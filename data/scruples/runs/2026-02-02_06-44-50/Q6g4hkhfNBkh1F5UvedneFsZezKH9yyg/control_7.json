During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong when they left their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The main issue here is the fianc\u00e9's ongoing contact with an ex-friend, despite multiple promises to cut ties.\n\nFirst, the key points in the scenario: the couple has been together for seven years and has a child. They broke up for a month, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for most of his life. After reconciling, the author expected him to stop contact, which he initially did but later continued. The author discovered that he was still following this girl and her sister on social media, even liking her photos multiple times. They had several confrontations, and each time he promised to delete them but didn't. Eventually, the author left because of this pattern.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective: they felt betrayed by the ongoing contact, even if there's no proof of cheating. The trust was broken through repeated deceptions and broken promises. The author's actions\u2014leaving the relationship\u2014are a response to this lack of respect for their boundaries and the trust issues. The fianc\u00e9's behavior suggests a pattern of dishonesty and inability to move on, which is a valid reason for ending a long-term relationship, especially when it's affecting their well-being and trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might argue that there's no actual cheating, just contact. But the author's trust and emotional well-being are crucial in a relationship. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 went out of his way to unblock them (even after blocking them) shows a deliberate choice to maintain that connection, which the author found intolerable. In relationships, trust and respect for each other's boundaries are foundational. If one partner repeatedly breaks those trust boundaries despite promises, it's a significant issue.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship. They had a right to expect honesty and respect. The fianc\u00e9's actions, even without proven cheating, were destructive to the relationship's trust. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
