During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The situation involves ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with a female friend, despite promises to cut ties. The key points are the repeated breaches of trust, the author's attempts to address the issue, and the fianc\u00e9's pattern of lying and not following through.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The couple has been together for seven years and has a child. The fianc\u00e9 has a long-standing friendship with a woman, and even after breaking up briefly, the contact continued. The author discovered this contact multiple times, leading to confrontations and broken promises. The fianc\u00e9's actions, like liking the woman's photos and not deleting her from social media, suggest a lack of respect for the author's boundaries. \n\nThe author snooped through the phone, which might be seen as invasive, but given the context of repeated lies, it's understandable. The fianc\u00e9's defensiveness and inability to follow through on commitments could indicate a deeper issue, maybe emotional unavailability or a lack of commitment to the relationship. The fact that the author left after the fianc\u00e9 unblocked the woman and her sister again shows a pattern that the author can't tolerate. \n\nCheating isn't explicitly mentioned, but the emotional infidelity and deceit are significant. The author's decision to end the relationship is based on trust issues and the fianc\u00e9's inability to change. In relationships, trust is foundational. If one partner can't respect the other's boundaries, it's a major red flag. The author isn't at fault for seeking a relationship where both partners are committed and honest. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
