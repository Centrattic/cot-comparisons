During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a long-term relationship where the author is considering leaving their fianc\u00e9 because he's been in contact with an ex or a girl he's known for a long time, and there's evidence of ongoing interaction, like liking posts on social media. The key points here are the history of the issue, the actions taken by the author, and the fianc\u00e9's responses.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for seven years and has a child. The fianc\u00e9 had contact with another girl during a breakup and even after getting back together. The author expected him to cut off contact, which he initially did but then kept reconnecting. The author snooped through his phone multiple times and found instances where he was still in contact, leading to confrontations. Each time, the fianc\u00e9 promised to delete the girl but ended up reconnecting. The author finally left after discovering that the fianc\u00e9 unblocked both the girl and her sister.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate this. The main issue is about trust and betrayal. The fianc\u00e9 hasn't actually cheated, but he's maintaining contact that the author perceives as inappropriate. The author's actions of snooping might be a red flag, as it's an invasion of privacy. However, given the repeated pattern of the fianc\u00e9 not following through on his promises to cut off contact, the author feels justified in ending the relationship due to lack of trust.\n\nTrust is a cornerstone in any relationship, especially in a long-term engagement with children involved. The fianc\u00e9's actions, though not cheating, could be seen as emotionally unfaithful or showing a lack of commitment. The author has tried multiple times to address the issue, and each time the fianc\u00e9 relapses. The author's decision to leave might be considered reasonable if trust can't be restored. On the other hand, the author's own actions of repeatedly checking the phone could be seen as lacking trust from the start, but if the fianc\u00e9 has a history of breaking promises, that could justify the author's vigilance.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships are complex, and there's no absolute answer. However, based on the information, the author's decision to leave because of ongoing breaches of trust might be understandable. The fianc\u00e9's inability to cut off contact despite promises could be a deal-breaker. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
