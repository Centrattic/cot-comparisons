During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for Announcing) post is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. The main issue seems to be ongoing contact with an ex-girlfriend despite promises to stop.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they found their fianc\u00e9 still in contact with this girl, even after multiple confrontations and promises to delete her. The fianc\u00e9 liked her pictures, kept her on social media, and even unblocked her after previously blocking. The author also mentions that the fianc\u00e9 started liking the sister's pictures, which he claimed was an accident. Now, the author is considering ending the relationship because of this continued contact, even without proof of cheating.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author is taking action because of repeated breaches of trust and the fianc\u00e9 not following through on commitments. They have a child together, so this is a serious relationship. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 hasn't actually admitted to cheating, just ongoing contact. The author's decision might be based on feeling that the fianc\u00e9 isn't respecting boundaries and is emotionally invested elsewhere.\n\nBut is the author justified? In relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner consistently violates boundaries despite promises, it's reasonable to feel that the relationship isn't safe or healthy. The author has tried multiple times to resolve this and each time the fianc\u00e9 relapses. The fact that he went out of his way to unblock them suggests he's prioritizing this connection over his partner's feelings. Even if there's no physical cheating, the emotional aspect can be damaging. The author's decision to leave might be about preserving their own mental health and the integrity of the relationship.\n\nThe user might think the author is too harsh, but given the repeated issues and lack of real change from the fianc\u00e9, ending things could be a valid choice. So, probably the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
