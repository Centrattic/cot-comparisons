During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they're a fianc\u00e9 of 7 years, with a child, and there's been this ongoing issue with the fianc\u00e9 not cutting contact with a girl he's known a long time. The author snoopeds the phone and found out he was still in contact, even after he promised to delete her. There were instances where he liked her pictures, and even unblocked her after promising to block. The key here is that the author is considering ending the relationship because of this, even though there's no actual evidence of cheating, just ongoing contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The fianc\u00e9 made promises to cut contact multiple times, but kept breaking them. The author feels betrayed and loses trust each time he fails to follow through. Even though it's not cheating, maintaining contact with someone in a way that causes distress in the relationship can be a problem. The author's actions of checking the phone might be seen as snooping, which could be a point of contention. However, given the repeated breaches of trust, maybe it's understandable.\n\nThen, the author decided to leave after the latest incident where the fianc\u00e9 unblocked the girl and her sister. The fianc\u00e9 gave excuses about accidentally reliking posts, but the author saw this as a pattern. The author is the one leaving, so the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the relationship was built on mutual trust and respect, and the fianc\u00e9 repeatedly violated that trust, then the author's decision to end things might be justified. On the other hand, if the author is being overly controlling or there's no direct infidelity, maybe there's a case for the author being wrong. But given the long-term pattern and the emotional impact, it seems the author is acting out of justified concern for their own well-being and the relationship's health. So, probably the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
