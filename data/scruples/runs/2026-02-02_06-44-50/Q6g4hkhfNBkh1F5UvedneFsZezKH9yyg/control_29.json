During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong after ending a 7-year relationship with their fianc\u00e9 because he couldn't stop contacting a girl he's known for a long time. The key points here are the repeated instances where the fianc\u00e9 continued to interact with this girl despite the author's requests for him to cut contact. The author mentions snooping because they felt it was necessary due to the ongoing issue, and found evidence like likes on the girl's sister's posts. The fianc\u00e9 often gave excuses or claimed he was trying to fix things but kept unblocking them. \n\nSo, the author is considering if ending the relationship is justified. The main question is whether the author is wrong for doing so. Let me think about the dynamics here. Trust is a big part of any relationship, especially a long-term one with a child. The fianc\u00e9's actions\u2014continuing contact, lying about deleting the girl, and even unblocking her again after promises\u2014indicate a repeated breach of trust. The author felt the need to check his phone multiple times, which suggests that the situation was causing significant distress and lack of trust.\n\nEven though there's no proof of cheating, the ongoing emotional infidelity (maintaining contact despite promises) is a valid reason for someone to leave. The author had to make a decision based on their own feelings of being disrespected and the fianc\u00e9's inability to honor his commitments. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 kept breaking promises and the author felt they couldn't move forward is understandable. In relationships, when trust is broken repeatedly and one partner isn't willing to change despite multiple chances, the other partner may feel it's necessary to end it to protect themselves and their family. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They acted based on their own emotional well-being and the boundaries they set in the relationship.\n"
