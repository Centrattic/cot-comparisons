During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 7-year engagement that's ending because of issues with the fianc\u00e9's contact with an ex. The user is asking if the person who ended the relationship is at fault.\n\nFirst, let me recap the key points. The couple has been together for 7 years and has a 6-year-old son. They had a one-month breakup 3 years ago during which the fianc\u00e9 talked to a girl he's known for a long time. When they got back together, the author expected him to cut contact with her. There were fights about it, and he deleted her, but later it turned out she was still on social media. The author snooped and found evidence of ongoing contact, including liking her posts. The fianc\u00e9 kept breaking promises to stop, leading the author to leave. Now, the author is wondering if they're in the wrong since there's no proof of cheating, just contact.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author was justified in leaving. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nLooking at the situation from a relationship ethics perspective: trust is a cornerstone. If one partner repeatedly breaks trust by maintaining contact with an ex despite promises to stop, that's a serious issue. The author tried to address it through communication and the fianc\u00e9 kept reverting, which likely eroded trust. The author's actions (snooping) could be seen as a last resort when communication failed. The fianc\u00e9's behavior, even if not cheating, is about betrayal of trust. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author overreacted or that the fianc\u00e9's actions, while questionable, don't constitute cheating. But considering the repeated violations after promises, and the emotional impact, the author's decision to end the engagement because of broken trust seems reasonable. The author isn't at fault for ending the relationship when the trust is irreparably broken. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
