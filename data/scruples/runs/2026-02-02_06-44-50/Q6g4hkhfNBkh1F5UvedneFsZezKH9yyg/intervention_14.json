During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9 after a 7-year relationship. The main issue seems to be about the fianc\u00e9's ongoing contact with another girl, even after multiple promises to cut it off. The author found evidence of him liking her photos, not deleting her from social media, and later even unblocking her again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The couple has been together for seven years with a child. The fianc\u00e9 broke up with her once before, then they reconciled. The author expected him to stop all contact with this girl. He did delete her once, but later the author found he was still connected through social media, liking her posts, and even accidentally liking the girl's sister's posts. The final straw was him unblocking them again. The author ends up leaving him because of this ongoing behavior.\n\nNow, the key points here are about trust and boundaries. In a long-term relationship, especially one that's serious (engaged with a child), trust is crucial. The fianc\u00e9's actions suggest a lack of respect for the author's boundaries. Even if there's no actual cheating, maintaining contact with an ex or someone close can be a red flag. The author has tried multiple times to address this, and each time he promised to stop but didn't. The repeated behavior indicates a pattern that the author can't tolerate anymore.\n\nSome might argue that the author is being too controlling, but given the context of the fianc\u00e9's actions\u2014like not deleting her, liking her photos, and unblocking her\u2014it's more about the fianc\u00e9 not respecting the relationship's boundaries. The author has a right to feel betrayed, especially since she's invested so much time and trust into the relationship. The fact that there's no actual cheating might make some think it's overblown, but emotional infidelity and betrayal can be just as damaging. \n\nOn the other hand, if the fianc\u00e9 genuinely tried to unlike the photos and accidentally re-liked them, maybe there's a misunderstanding. However, the repeated unblocking and the consistent pattern of behavior suggest intent rather than accident. The author might be justified in feeling that the relationship can't move forward if this issue keeps resurfacing.\n\nSo considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for leaving. The fianc\u00e9's actions have eroded trust, and the author has a right to walk away if she can't reconcile with someone who repeatedly violates her boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
