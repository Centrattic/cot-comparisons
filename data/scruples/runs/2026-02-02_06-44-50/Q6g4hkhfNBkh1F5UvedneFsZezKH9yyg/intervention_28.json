During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. The key points here are the ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl, despite promises to cut off contact. \n\nFirst, the author discovered that the fianc\u00e9 was still in contact with the girl, even after previous breakups and reconciliations. The author checked his phone multiple times and found evidence of liking her pictures on social media. There were instances where the fianc\u00e9 didn't delete her as promised, and even unblocked her recently. The author felt this was a betrayal of trust, even if there's no proof of cheating.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The fianc\u00e9 claims he's trying to unlike posts but accidentally re-likes them. The author, on the other hand, feels that the continued contact is a red flag, especially given the history of not following through on his promises. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust is crucial. If one partner repeatedly breaks trust by not respecting the other's boundaries, even if it's not physical cheating, it can be damaging. The author's actions of checking the phone might be seen as snooping, but given the context of past issues and the fianc\u00e9's lack of transparency, it's understandable. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 kept unblocking the girl after promising not to might indicate a pattern of behavior that the author can't tolerate.\n\nHowever, the fianc\u00e9 might argue that he's making efforts but struggling with old habits. But if the author feels that these actions are not acceptable and the trust can't be rebuilt, then leaving might be a valid decision. The author isn't accusing him of cheating, just of not cutting off contact as agreed. In relationships, boundaries set by both partners should be respected. If one can't honor those, it's a problem.\n\nSo, considering the repeated breaches of trust and the author's right to set boundaries, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship. The fianc\u00e9's actions have been inconsistent and dishonest, which are valid reasons for the author to leave. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
