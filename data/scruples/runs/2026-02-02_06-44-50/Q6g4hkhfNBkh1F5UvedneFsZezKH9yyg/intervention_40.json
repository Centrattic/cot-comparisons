During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for Asking?) post is in the wrong. The situation is a 7-year engagement where the author is ending things because their fianc\u00e9 has ongoing contact with another girl. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants to know the answer.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The authors' fianc\u00e9 had contact with a girl they've known for a long time. After a breakup, they got back together, and the author expected the fianc\u00e9 to cut contact. He did delete her but then later, the author found out he was still interacting via social media, even liking the girl's and her sister's posts. The author confronted him multiple times, but he kept the contact, leading the author to break things off.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nNow, considering the details: the fianc\u00e9 didn't cheat, but there's repeated contact with another woman, even after promises to cut it off. The author has evidence of ongoing communication, which they can see through social media interactions. The author is choosing to leave because trust is broken, even though there's no actual cheating. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner is not respecting the other's boundaries (like ending contact with an ex), that can be a deal-breaker. Even if there's no physical infidelity, emotional infidelity or the perception of it can be just as damaging. The author has tried multiple times to address the issue, and the fianc\u00e9 kept violating those boundaries. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's actions show a pattern of dishonesty and not following through on commitments. The author is ending the engagement because they can't trust him anymore. While some might argue that the author snooped through the phone, which could be seen as a breach of privacy, the context is that the fianc\u00e9 was deceptive about his actions. The author's actions were in response to repeated betrayals of trust.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, the author is justified in ending the relationship. The fianc\u00e9's behavior is the main issue here. The author is not in the wrong for choosing to leave when trust has been broken multiple times.\n"
