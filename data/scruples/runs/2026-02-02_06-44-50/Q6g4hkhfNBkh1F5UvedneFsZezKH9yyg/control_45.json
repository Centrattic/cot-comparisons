During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a 7-year engagement with a son, and the author is considering breaking off the relationship because their fianc\u00e9 can't stop contacting an old friend. The key points are the ongoing contact despite promises to cut it off, the author snooping and finding continued interaction, and finally the fianc\u00e9 unblocking them again without consent.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 has a history of not following through on deleting the girl from social media. Even after multiple confrontations and promises, he keeps reconnecting. The author discovered likes on the girl's sister's posts, which the fianc\u00e9 claimed was accidental. Then, he unblocks them again. That's pretty consistent behavior over time.\n\nThe author's actions include checking the phone, which some might see as invasive, but considering the context of repeated issues, it's understandable. The fianc\u00e9's actions show a pattern of not respecting boundaries. The author is ending the engagement because of this lack of trust and follow-through, even though there's no actual cheating. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner repeatedly breaks promises about cutting off contact, it's reasonable for the other to feel betrayed and decide to leave. The author isn't accusing of cheating, just persistent disrespect for boundaries. So, the author's decision is based on the fianc\u00e9's inability to honor commitments, which is a valid reason. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
