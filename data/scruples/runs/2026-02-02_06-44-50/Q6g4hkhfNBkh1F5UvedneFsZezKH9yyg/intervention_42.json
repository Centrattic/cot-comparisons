During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for A?) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a seven-year engagement, a child, and ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with a girl he's known a long time. The author discovered multiple instances where the fianc\u00e9 liked photos of this girl and her sister, even after promising to cut contact each time. Despite interventions and reconciliations, it seems the behavior keeps recurring. The author is considering breaking off the engagement because of this, even though there's no evidence of actual cheating, just persistent contact.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the key points. The main issue is whether the author is justified in leaving after seven years. The fianc\u00e9's actions are a consistent problem\u2014contact, liking photos, not deleting as promised. The author has tried multiple times to address it, leading to temporary fixes but the pattern repeats. The author has children with this person, so the stakes are high.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, trust and communication are crucial in a long-term relationship. The fianc\u00e9's repeated failures to honor commitments regarding contact with another woman could be seen as breaches of trust. Even if it's not cheating, the ongoing behavior might indicate emotional unavailability or a lack of commitment. The author is justified in feeling that their trust is eroded and that the relationship isn't stable enough for marriage.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is overreacting, especially if there's no proof of cheating. The fianc\u00e9 might claim he's not doing anything wrong, just keeping friends. But given the circumstances\u2014breaking up before, the pattern of lying, and the repeated unblocking\u2014it's more than just friendship. The author's decision to leave is based on a culmination of these issues, which have not been resolved despite efforts.\n\nThe key question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the fianc\u00e9's actions are deceitful and harmful to the relationship, then the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and the stability of their family. The author has every right to expect fidelity and honesty, especially when it affects their trust and the future of their child. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing.\n"
