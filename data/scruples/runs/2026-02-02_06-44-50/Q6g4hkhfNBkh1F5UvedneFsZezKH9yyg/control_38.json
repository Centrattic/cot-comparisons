During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they would be in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after 7 years because he keeps staying in contact with a girl he's known for a long time. They had a breakup before, and during that time he talked to the girl. When they got back together, they expected him to cut contact, which he did but then didn't, and there was snoop evidence of liking her photos, etc. The key point is that there's no actual evidence of cheating, just ongoing contact.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author is in the wrong. I need to think about the context. The author's main issue is the fianc\u00e9 not cutting contact with an ex, which led to trust issues. The fianc\u00e9's actions are clearly problematic in terms of trust and boundaries. Even without cheating, maintaining contact with someone else after a breakup can be a significant issue in a relationship, especially when the other person is uncomfortable with it. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 lied about deleting her each time and then kept reappearing suggests a pattern of dishonesty and a lack of respect for the author's feelings. \n\nThe author's decision to leave is based on the inability to trust and the repeated betrayal of that trust. People have different thresholds for what they consider acceptable in a relationship, and if the fianc\u00e9 can't meet those boundaries, it's understandable that the author would end things. The presence of a child complicates things, but the author is the one deciding to leave, not the other way around. The fianc\u00e9's actions are the consistent issue here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons based on the fianc\u00e9's behavior and the lack of trust. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
