During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original scenario is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. The situation involves multiple instances where the fianc\u00e9 continued contact with another girl despite promises to cut it off. The author of the scenario confronts, snoops, and eventually leaves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The fianc\u00e9 had an almost six-year-old child with the author. They had a previous breakup, and after getting back together, the author expected the fianc\u00e9 to stop contact with this other girl. The fianc\u00e9 initially deleted her but then later was found still interacting with her on social media. The author snoop multiple times, leading to confrontations and eventual separation.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author was justified in leaving. The fianc\u00e9's actions involved ongoing contact with another woman despite repeated promises to stop. Even if there's no actual cheating confirmed, the pattern of behavior suggests a lack of commitment to the relationship and a breach of trust. The author's actions of snooping might be seen as invasive, but given the context of repeated breaches, it's understandable as a protective measure.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit complex. The fianc\u00e9's behavior is clearly problematic, showing a lack of respect for the author's feelings and the relationship. The author, on the other hand, made the decision to end the relationship after multiple attempts to resolve the issue failed. While snooping isn't ideal, in this context, it's a response to the fianc\u00e9's dishonesty. The author's decision to leave could be seen as self-respecting, prioritizing their own well-being and that of their child.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's actions are the primary issue here. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
