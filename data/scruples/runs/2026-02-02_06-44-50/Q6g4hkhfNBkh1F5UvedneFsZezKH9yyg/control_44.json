During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years because he's been in contact with another girl. The author has a child with the fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. They were together for seven years, had a kid. Broke up briefly three years ago, then got back together. The author expected the fianc\u00e9 to cut contact with this girl he's known all his life. But even after conflicts, the fianc\u00e9 continued to interact with her on social media. The author snooped and found evidence of ongoing likes and interactions. Confronted him, he got angry but said he'd stop. Then later, the author found more likes, including the girl's sister. The fianc\u00e9 claimed it was accidental. Now, recently, the author found the girl and her sister unblocked again. So the author left him.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about trust, boundaries in a relationship, and evidence of ongoing contact despite promises. The author felt justified because they had evidence of repeated breaches of trust, even if there's no proof of cheating. The fianc\u00e9's actions suggest a pattern of not respecting the author's boundaries, which might have eroded trust over time.\n\nIn relationships, especially long-term ones, maintaining trust and respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. If one partner repeatedly violates those boundaries, even without cheating, it can be a valid reason to end the relationship. The author did confront the fianc\u00e9 multiple times, and he made promises he didn't keep. The fact that he had to unblock them again shows intent, maybe. The author's decision to leave after consistent issues seems reasonable. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
