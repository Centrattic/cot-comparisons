During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9 after seven years. They have a child together. The key points here are the ongoing issue with the fianc\u00e9 not cutting ties with another girl he's known for a long time. There were multiple instances where he supposedly deleted her contact but later reconnected, sometimes accidentally according to him. The author found evidence of him liking pictures of the girl and her sister on social media, and recently unblocked them. The question is if she's wrong for ending the relationship based on these actions without evidence of actual cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of a seven-year relationship with a child. Trust is crucial in such a long-term partnership. The fianc\u00e9's behavior shows a pattern of not respecting her boundaries. Even if he didn't cheat, continuously reconnecting with someone in a way that causes emotional distress can erode trust. The author has made multiple attempts to address this, leading to temporary fixes but recurring issues. The fact that he unblocked them intentionally, as per the latest incident, might indicate a lack of commitment to honor her feelings.\n\nThe user's decision to leave is based on her emotional well-being and the inability to trust her partner. In many cases, the right to end a relationship due to emotional harm is valid, even without physical cheating. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing her mental health and the stability of her son's environment. The fianc\u00e9's actions have been persistent and dismissive, which justifies her decision. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
