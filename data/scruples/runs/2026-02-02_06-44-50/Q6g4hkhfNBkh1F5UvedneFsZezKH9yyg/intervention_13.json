During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The author is considering ending a 7-year engagement because her fianc\u00e9 can't cut ties with a girl he's known for most of his life. There's a son involved, so the stakes are high.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple has been together a long time, and there was a prior breakup where the fianc\u00e9 started talking to this girl. After reconciling, the author expected him to cut contact, but he didn't. The author snooped and found he was still in contact, liked her photos, etc. They fought, he deleted her, but then she reappeared. The author confronted him again, he left for three days, then swore to delete her again. Then, three weeks ago, he liked the girl's sister's pictures, which he claimed was an accident. Now, he's unblocked both the girl and her sister.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is justified in ending the relationship based on this behavior. The user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. I need to evaluate the situation from both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the fianc\u00e9's actions\u2014maintaining contact with an ex-friend, liking her photos, and even unblocking her after promises to cut ties\u2014could be seen as a breach of trust. The author is worried about infidelity, even if there's no concrete evidence of cheating. The repeated pattern of breaking promises might indicate a lack of commitment to the relationship. The author's decision to end the engagement, while painful, might be a necessary step to protect herself and their son from ongoing conflict and potential future issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 claims he didn't intend to keep the contact, and the author did snoop through his phone. Snooping can be a sensitive issue because it involves privacy. However, given the history of the issue, it might be seen as a last resort. The author has a right to feel insecure and betrayed if her partner isn't respecting her boundaries. The fact that he unblocked them intentionally last night might be the final straw, showing he's not serious about fixing the problem.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she's trying to protect her own well-being and their child's future by leaving a partner who repeatedly breaks trust, she might not be in the wrong. However, if the fianc\u00e9's actions don't constitute actual cheating but more emotional involvement, some might argue that the author is overreacting. But considering the duration and the history of the issue, it's a pattern of behavior that's hard to overlook.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, people often prioritize trust and communication in relationships. If the fianc\u00e9 can't honor his commitments, it's understandable that the author would feel like the relationship is unsustainable. The presence of a child adds complexity, but the author is still allowed to make decisions for her own happiness and her child's well-being, even if it means ending the engagement.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the fianc\u00e9's repeated failures to respect her boundaries and the author's efforts to seek resolution before leaving suggest that she's acting within her rights to protect herself and her family.\n"
