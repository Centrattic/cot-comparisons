During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is a 7-year engagement with a son, and there's been an on-again, off-again issue with the fianc\u00e9 contacting an old friend, let's call her Girl X. The author found out multiple times over the years that the fianc\u00e9 was still in contact with Girl X, even after promises to cut it off. The latest incident is that he unblocked her and her sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is the one who snooped through the phone initially. That's a big point. Snooping can be a breach of trust. But then again, the fianc\u00e9 had a history of not keeping his promises to block Girl X. So maybe the author felt it was justified because of past issues.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9 claims he accidentally re-liked the pictures when trying to unlike them. But the latest action is intentional\u2014he unblocked them. That's a new step in the behavior. The author left him after this latest incident. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9 hasn't admitted to cheating, just maintaining contact. But in a long-term relationship, boundaries around contact with an ex or close friend are important. If the fianc\u00e9 repeatedly breaks those boundaries despite promises, that's a red flag. \n\nThe author has evidence of ongoing contact, which could be seen as a betrayal even if not physical cheating. Emotional infidelity is a real issue for many people. The author's actions (snooping) might be a problem, but considering the history, maybe it's understandable stress. \n\nIs ending the engagement after multiple breaches of trust wrong? It seems like the author has given multiple chances, and each time the fianc\u00e9 hasn't followed through. The author might feel that trust is broken beyond repair. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might argue that the contact was innocent and the author's snooping violated privacy. But the key here is the pattern of behavior. The author's decision to leave is based on not just one incident but a series of broken promises and intentional actions to reconnect with someone that's causing issues. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. If communication failed and the fianc\u00e9 couldn't respect the boundaries, the author has the right to leave. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because the fianc\u00e9's actions were a repeated breach of trust.\n"
