During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ending a 7-year engagement because her fianc\u00e9 is maintaining contact with a girl he's known for a long time, despite promises to cut ties. The author found out through snooping that he continued to like her photos and even unblocked her again after agreeing to stop. The key points here are the fidelity of the relationship, the trust issues, and the author's actions of snooping.\n\nFirst, fidelity is a big part of any committed relationship. Even if there's no actual cheating, the fianc\u00e9's actions of liking the girl's photos and maintaining contact could be seen as a breach of trust. The author had a legitimate concern when he failed to follow through on his promises each time, leading to repeated confrontations. This pattern of behavior might indicate a lack of commitment to the relationship, which can be grounds for ending it.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did snoop through his phone, which is a questionable act. Privacy in relationships is important, and snooping can be seen as a violation of trust. However, the context here is that the author had valid reasons to be concerned given the history of the fianc\u00e9 not following through on his promises. The repeated breaking of promises and the specific actions (liking other people's photos, unblocking) might justify the author's decision to end the engagement.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main argument against the author would be the snooping, but in this context, it's a response to the fianc\u00e9's dishonesty. The fianc\u00e9's actions over time built up to a point where trust was completely broken. The author is ending the relationship because of the fianc\u00e9's inability to let go of another person, which is a significant issue in a committed relationship. Therefore, the author's decision might be justified as self-preservation and protecting their son's future.\n"
