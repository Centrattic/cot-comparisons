During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The situation involves ongoing issues with her fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with a girl he's known for a long time, despite promises to cut off contact. The author found evidence on social media where he liked the girl's pictures and even the girl's sister's posts, and he unblocked them after previously blocking them. The key question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship based on this, even without proof of cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around relationships and trust. In many relationships, maintaining contact with an ex or someone you've been emotionally close to can be a sensitive issue. Even if there's no physical cheating, emotional infidelity or breaches of trust can be significant. The fianc\u00e9 made promises to cut off contact but repeatedly broke them, which could be seen as a lack of respect for the author's feelings and boundaries.\n\nThe author's actions of snooping through the phone might be a point of contention. Some might argue that invading privacy without consent is wrong, while others might see it as a desperate measure due to the fianc\u00e9's dishonesty. However, the fact that the fianc\u00e9 kept violating trust by reconnecting with the other girl, even after confrontations, suggests a pattern of behavior that's harmful to the relationship.\n\nThe author is the parent of their child, so the decision to leave also affects their son. But in situations where trust is broken repeatedly, it's possible that staying could lead to more long-term harm, both emotionally and in terms of the relationship dynamics. The fianc\u00e9's inability to honor his commitments might indicate deeper issues, like emotional unavailability or lack of commitment to the marriage.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is overreacting, especially since there's no proof of cheating. The fianc\u00e9 claims he didn't intend to reconnect and that his actions were accidental. The author believed these claims before but is now disillusioned. However, the repeated nature of the transgressions might justify her decision, as trust is foundational in a long-term relationship.\n\nIn terms of cultural or societal expectations, fidelity isn't just about physical acts but also about emotional commitment. If one partner can't respect the boundaries set by the other, it can erode the relationship. The author's decision to leave is a personal choice, but whether she's in the wrong depends on the values one prioritizes\u2014trust, honesty, and boundaries versus forgiveness and working through issues.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for ending the relationship if the fianc\u00e9's actions have consistently broken trust and if the relationship has become untenable due to his inability to change his behavior. The decision to leave when there's a pattern of betrayal, even without physical cheating, can be seen as a justified choice to protect one's emotional well-being and that of their child.\n"
