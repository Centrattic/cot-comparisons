During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they've been together seven years, have a child. They had a breakup a few years ago, then reconciled. The main issue seems to be the fianc\u00e9's continued contact with another girl. The author found out he was still in touch through social media, even after he promised to delete her. There were instances where he liked the girl's pictures and her sister's. The fianc\u00e9 gave various excuses each time, like accidental likes or trying to unlike but messing up. The final straw was unblocking them again.\n\nThe author is now considering ending the relationship because of this ongoing behavior. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought the author might be wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to feel insecure and concerned about their partner's loyalty. The fianc\u00e9's actions could be seen as a lack of commitment to the relationship, especially if they've made promises not to contact the other girl. The fact that the author found out through snooping might be a point against them, but it's understandable given the situation and the presence of a child. The fianc\u00e9's pattern of behavior\u2014repeatedly breaking promises and not taking the issue seriously\u2014could be seen as the root problem here.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might not have been cheating, just maintaining a friendship. The author's decision to leave based on contact that isn't actual cheating could be seen as overreacting. However, the article mentions that the author has a right to feel hurt and that the fianc\u00e9's actions might be emotionally unfaithful in some way. The key is whether the contact is a dealbreaker for the author. In relationships, boundaries are agreed upon by both partners. If the fianc\u00e9 repeatedly breaks those boundaries established by his partner, that's a significant issue.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014leaving the relationship after repeated violations\u2014might be justified if they feel that the trust is broken. The presence of a child adds complexity, but the author is making a choice for their own well-being. It's hard to say if the author is wrong because it's their right to end a relationship if they feel disrespected or if the partner isn't meeting their needs. The fianc\u00e9's inability to sever ties despite promises could be seen as a failure to meet the expectations of the relationship. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to make sure.\n"
