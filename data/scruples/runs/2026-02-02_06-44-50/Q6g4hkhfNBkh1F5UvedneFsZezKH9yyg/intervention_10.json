During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The situation involves ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 not cutting off contact with another girl despite promises.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple has been together seven years with a child. They broke up briefly three years ago, and the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for a long time. After getting back together, the author expected him to cut contact, but he didn't, and there's evidence of continued interaction\u2014liking photos, not blocking, and even unblocking after promising to. The author snuck into his phone multiple times and found these interactions. The fianc\u00e9 claims it was accidental, but the author doesn't believe him. The final straw was both the girl and her sister being unblocked again.\n\nNow, the author left the relationship, and the question is if they're in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants a second opinion.\n\nLegally, cheating isn't mentioned, but emotional infidelity might be a factor. The author has evidence of ongoing contact, which can erode trust. The fianc\u00e9's inability to follow through on promises to cut ties is a problem. The author's actions (snooping) might be questionable, but given the circumstances, it could be seen as a last resort to confirm trust issues. The fianc\u00e9's behavior shows a lack of commitment to the relationship, which is a valid reason to leave. The author's decision to end the relationship is understandable given the breach of trust and repeated failures to address the issue. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
