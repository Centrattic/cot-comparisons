During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. The key points here are the reasons for the breakup and the evidence involved.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for 7 years with a child. The fianc\u00e9 had a past breakup where the guy reconnected with an old friend (the girl). The author expected him to cut contact, which he did temporarily but later resumed. The author snooped through his phone and found ongoing interactions, leading to confrontations. The guy promised to stop each time but failed. The latest incident involved unblocking the girl and her sister, which the author found out and decided to leave.\n\nThe author is questioning if they're in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another perspective. \n\nSo, the ethical dilemma here is about betrayal and trust. The fianc\u00e9 is maintaining contact with another woman, liking her posts, and not being transparent. Even if there's no concrete evidence of cheating, the persistent behavior suggests a breach of trust. The author felt it was necessary to protect their relationship and their son's environment. \n\nIn such cases, when one partner consistently breaks the other's trust despite promises, leaving the relationship might be seen as a justified decision. The author's actions were based on the accumulation of broken promises and lack of respect for boundaries, which can be valid reasons. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
