During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending a 7-year engagement with the father of her son. The main issue is her fianc\u00e9's ongoing contact with another girl despite promises to cut it off.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together seven years and have a child. There was a past breakup where he talked to this girl, got back together, but then she blocked the author on social media. He continued liking her posts, and even after confrontations, he didn't delete her. She snooped and found out, confronted him multiple times, and he kept the contact. Most recently, he even unblocked her and her sister. She ends the engagement because of this, even though there's no proof of cheating.\n\nNow, considering trust and commitment in a long-term relationship, especially with a child involved. The author felt betrayed each time he failed to follow through on his promises. The key here is the repeated broken commitments. Even if there's no actual cheating, the consistent disregard for her feelings and the relationship's boundaries is significant. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's actions suggest a lack of respect for her trust. Maintaining contact with someone he's known for life, especially after being asked to cut it off, indicates a pattern. The author had to snoop multiple times, which shows that communication and trust were already strained. \n\nIn relationships, when one partner repeatedly breaks trust, even without physical infidelity, it can be equally devastating. The author's decision to leave is based on the erosion of trust over time. The presence of a child adds complexity, but the question is about whether she's in the wrong. \n\nLegally and socially, while cheating might be a clear-cut case, emotional infidelity or maintaining harmful connections can also be valid reasons to end a relationship. The author's actions are a response to ongoing betrayal, not a single incident. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the fianc\u00e9's actions repeatedly violated trust, leading her to make a difficult decision after multiple attempts to resolve the issue.\n"
