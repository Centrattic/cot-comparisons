During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the person who wrote the WIBTA post) is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with their fianc\u00e9, the father of their son, because he can't stop contacting another girl. The key points here are the timeline of events and the evidence of the fianc\u00e9's actions.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for 7 years and has a child. They broke up for a month three years ago, during which the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for a long time. They reconciled, and the author expected him to cut contact. He initially deleted her but then kept reconnecting in various social media platforms. The author found out through snooping, which is a bit iffy, but maybe justified given the situation. \n\nThe main issue here seems to be the repeated breaking of promises by the fianc\u00e9. Even after confrontations and promises to delete the girl's contacts, he kept liking her posts, accidentally or not, and even unblocked her again after being asked. The author is left feeling betrayed and can't trust him anymore, leading them to break up. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9 didn't actually cheat, but the continuous contact and the pattern of lying and breaking promises might be the problem. The author had to check his phone multiple times, which shows a lack of trust and possible insecurity. But in a long-term relationship, especially with a child, trust is crucial. If someone keeps violating boundaries set by their partner, even if it's not cheating, it can be a deal-breaker. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's actions, while not physical infidelity, might be emotional infidelity. Emotional infidelity can be just as damaging because it involves emotional investment elsewhere. The author might feel neglected or that their partner is emotionally unavailable. Also, the fianc\u00e9's inability to follow through on his promises (deleting the girl's contacts) shows a lack of commitment to the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did snoop through the phone, which isn't ideal. However, given the context of repeated issues and the desire to find the truth, maybe it's understandable. The fianc\u00e9's behavior was secretive, like the girl blocking the author to hide interactions, which adds to the deceitfulness.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong because they had to protect their emotional well-being and the integrity of the relationship. The fianc\u00e9's repeated actions, despite promises, indicate that he might not be able to fully commit, which is a valid reason to end the relationship, especially in a long-term partnership where trust is essential. Therefore, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
