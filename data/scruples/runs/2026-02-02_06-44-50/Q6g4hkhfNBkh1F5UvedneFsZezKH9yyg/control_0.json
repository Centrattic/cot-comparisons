During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 7-year engagement that's ending because the fianc\u00e9 is still in contact with another girl. The author (probably the person posting) found out that their fianc\u00e9 kept this girl on social media even after promises to delete her. They also mention that the fianc\u00e9 liked the girl's photos and even the girl's sister's photos. The main issue is whether the author is justified in ending the relationship based on the fianc\u00e9's actions, especially since there's no proof of cheating just yet.\n\nFirst, let's look at the facts. The couple has been together for 7 years and has a child. They had a breakup before and got back together. The fianc\u00e9 had contact with another girl during that time, and after getting back together, the author expected him to cut all contact. He did delete her initially but kept reconnecting. The author snooped and found ongoing interactions. The fianc\u00e9 denies cheating but keeps reconnecting with the girl and her sister. \n\nNow, considering trust and commitment in a long-term relationship, especially in an engagement where they're planning to marry, trust is crucial. The fianc\u00e9's actions\u2014keeping the girl and her sister on social media, liking their posts, and unblocking them\u2014could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if there's no physical cheating, emotional infidelity or actions that make the partner feel insecure can be valid reasons for ending a relationship. \n\nThe author is choosing to leave because the fianc\u00e9 can't cut off contact despite repeated promises. The fianc\u00e9 claims he's trying to unlike the posts accidentally, but the author doubts that. The repeated pattern suggests a lack of commitment to the relationship and the author's trust. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the fianc\u00e9's actions are the main issue here. The author feels betrayed and can't trust their partner. In relationships, when one partner can't respect the other's boundaries (like cutting off contact with someone they're uncomfortable with), it's a sign of deeper problems. The author's decision to leave is based on ongoing issues that affect the trust and stability needed for marriage. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the fianc\u00e9's behavior has been consistent and has eroded trust. The author has a right to feel insecure and to end the relationship if the partner can't meet their expectations, especially after multiple chances.\n"
