During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 7-year relationship with a fianc\u00e9 who has a son with the author. The main issue is the fianc\u00e9's ongoing contact with a girl from his past, even after promises to cut ties.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The couple broke up once before, then got back together. The author expected the fianc\u00e9 to stop contact with this girl, which he did, but later resumed. The author snooped and found he was still connected, liked her photos, etc. The fianc\u00e9 gave excuses but kept the contact. Now, the author is ending the relationship because of this, not because of actual cheating but ongoing contact. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship.\n\nI need to consider relationship ethics. Trust is crucial in a relationship. If one partner is repeatedly breaking a promise to cut ties, that could be a deal-breaker. But maybe the author overreacted? The fianc\u00e9 hasn't actually cheated, just kept in touch. However, constant deception and the fact that it's been a recurring issue might justify the author's decision.\n\nThe author's actions include snooping, which isn't ideal, but maybe understandable given the circumstances. The fianc\u00e9's behavior shows a lack of respect for the author's feelings and boundaries. Even if it's not cheating, the pattern of dishonesty and ongoing contact could be grounds for ending the relationship.\n\nBut is the author wrong? If the author's main issue is the ongoing contact and lies, then ending the relationship because of that isn't necessarily wrong. However, some might argue that without actual cheating, it's harsh. But in long-term relationships, trust and boundaries are vital. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 couldn't honor his promises suggests deeper issues. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship due to the breach of trust and ongoing issues. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
