During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 7-year relationship with a fianc\u00e9 and a son. The main issue is the fianc\u00e9's continued contact with an old friend, which the author finds unacceptable.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that after a breakup, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for most of his life. When they got back together, the author expected him to cut off contact. He did delete her initially but later the author found out he was still connected on social media, liking her photos, and even the sister's. The fianc\u00e9 gave various explanations like accidental likes and trying to unlike them, but the author kept finding more evidence. Finally, he unblocked both the girl and her sister again.\n\nThe author is asking if they're wrong for ending the relationship because the fianc\u00e9 can't let go of another girl, even though there's no evidence of cheating. The key points here are trust, boundaries, and the impact on the relationship. The author set a boundary that the fianc\u00e9 couldn't respect, leading to repeated breaches. The fact that the author found multiple instances where the fianc\u00e9 didn't follow through on promises to cut off contact suggests a pattern of behavior that the author couldn't tolerate. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's actions, even if not cheating, might still be a violation of trust and emotional boundaries. The author has the right to expect fidelity and respect for their boundaries in a committed relationship, especially with a child involved. The author's decision to leave is based on the fianc\u00e9's inability to meet these expectations consistently. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
