During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The key points here are the ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl despite promises to cut it off. \n\nFirst, the couple has a child together, which adds emotional weight. The author discovered that the fianc\u00e9 kept contacting this girl even after agreeing to stop. There were instances where he liked her photos on social media, which made the author feel betrayed. Even after confrontations and promises to delete her, the contact resumed. The final straw was unblocking both the girl and her sister, which the fianc\u00e9 claimed was accidental.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship. The main factors here are trust and respect. The author felt that the fianc\u00e9 was not respecting their boundaries by continuously contacting the girl. The fianc\u00e9's actions, even if not actual cheating, could be seen as emotional infidelity or a lack of commitment to the relationship. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, trust is crucial. If one partner repeatedly breaks promises and undermines the other's trust, it can be a valid reason to end the relationship. The author's decision might be justified as they felt their emotional needs weren't met and their trust was violated. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the fianc\u00e9 didn't actually cheat, just maintained contact. But the pattern of behavior shows a disregard for the author's feelings and boundaries. The fact that he had to be confronted multiple times and still continued suggests a lack of effort to fix the issue. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for leaving because the trust was broken, and their emotional well-being was affected. The fianc\u00e9's actions, though not cheating, eroded the foundation of the relationship. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
