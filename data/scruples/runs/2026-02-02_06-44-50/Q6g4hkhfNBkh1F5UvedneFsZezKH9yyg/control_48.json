During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is a 7-year engagement with a son, and the author is considering leaving because the fianc\u00e9 keeps reconnecting with an old friend. The main issue seems to be the ongoing contact with this girl, even after multiple promises to cut it off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple broke up briefly three years ago, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to this girl. When they got back together, the author expected him to stop contact, which he initially did, but then later resumed. The author found out by snooping on his phone, which might raise some questions about trust and privacy. But the main issue here is the repeated behavior of the fianc\u00e9 re-establishing contact despite promises to stop.\n\nThe author has evidence of liking the girl's social media posts, and even unblocking her after he supposedly blocked her. The fianc\u00e9's explanations are that he accidentally re-liked the pictures and that he unblocked them to unlike, but the author found out again. The final straw is unblocking both the girl and her sister, which the fianc\u00e9 didn't even deny, just explained as an accident.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, in a relationship, trust is crucial. If one partner is repeatedly violating the other's trust, even without cheating, the non-offending partner is within their rights to end the relationship. The author has tried multiple times to address the issue, and each time the fianc\u00e9 hasn't followed through. The fact that the author has a child with this person adds another layer, but the situation still requires mutual respect and boundaries.\n\nThe question is whether the author overreacted. The fianc\u00e9's actions, while not physical infidelity, could be seen as emotional unfaithfulness or at least a breach of trust. The author's decision to leave after multiple broken promises might be justified. On the other hand, some might argue that the author snooped, which could be a breach of privacy. However, given the repeated issues and the fianc\u00e9's failure to honor his commitments, the author's actions might be reasonable.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, many would side with the author because maintaining trust is essential. The fianc\u00e9's inability to cut off contact despite the author's clear discomfort and the impact on their relationship suggests a lack of respect for her feelings. Even without cheating, the pattern of behavior is problematic. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
