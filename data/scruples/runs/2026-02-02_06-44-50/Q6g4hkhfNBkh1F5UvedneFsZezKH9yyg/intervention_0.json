During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9. So, the situation is they've been engaged for seven years, have a child together. There was a breakup a few years ago, then they reconciled. The fianc\u00e9 was supposed to cut contact with this girl he's known for a long time, but he kept liking her pictures and not deleting her, even after promises. The author snooped and found out multiple times, leading to the decision to end the relationship. The question is if the author is wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's actions: they discovered the fianc\u00e9 was continuing to interact with this girl despite promises to stop. They snooped, which might be seen as a breach of privacy. But the fianc\u00e9 also made commitments not to contact the girl and repeatedly broke them. The main issue is that there's no evidence of actual cheating, just ongoing contact. So, is the author justified in leaving based on that?\n\nOn one hand, trust is crucial in a relationship. If one partner is repeatedly dishonest about their actions, even if it's not cheating, it can erode trust. The fianc\u00e9 kept lying and breaking promises, which could be a deal-breaker. The author might feel that the relationship can't continue without trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the author snooped through the phone, which could be seen as an invasion of privacy. Even though it revealed the fianc\u00e9's behavior, it's a contentious method. Also, the fianc\u00e9 might not have actually cheated, just had inappropriate contact. The question is whether that's enough to end a long-term relationship with a child involved.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate if their actions are justified. The key points are the broken trust and repeated lies versus the method of discovery and lack of concrete cheating. In many cases, people end relationships over trust issues even without physical infidelity. The author might be protecting themselves from further betrayal, which is valid. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
