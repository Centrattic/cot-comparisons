During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The main issue is about the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with an ex-friend, leading to repeated conflicts.\n\nFirst, the author found out that their fianc\u00e9 was still in contact with a girl he knew for a long time, even after agreeing to cut her off. They snooped again and found likes on the girl's sister's posts. Then, the fianc\u00e9 unblocked them, which led the author to end the relationship. The question is whether the author is wrong for doing that.\n\nThe key points here are trust, communication, and boundaries. The author felt that the fianc\u00e9 was breaking their agreement to cut off contact, which caused repeated hurt. Even though there's no evidence of cheating, the ongoing contact was a breach of trust. The author tried multiple times to resolve the issue, gave the fianc\u00e9 chances to comply, but the problem persisted. \n\nIn relationships, boundaries set by mutual agreement are important. If one partner repeatedly violates those boundaries, it can be a reason for ending the relationship. The author's decision might be seen as justified because the trust was broken multiple times, leading to emotional distress. On the other hand, some might argue that the author was too quick to end things without giving more chances or addressing the root issues.\n\nHowever, considering the length of the relationship and the seriousness of the repeated breaches, the author's actions seem like a response to a lack of respect for their feelings and boundaries. The fianc\u00e9's inability to follow through on promises could indicate deeper issues like commitment problems. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their emotional well-being and the future of their family. So, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
