During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with her fianc\u00e9. The key points here are the ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with an ex-friend, despite promises to cut ties. The author discovered multiple instances where the fianc\u00e9 liked posts from this girl and even her sister, and recently unblocked them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional and relational aspects. The author has a child with her fianc\u00e9, so the relationship is long-term and serious. The main issue is the fianc\u00e9's inability to sever contact, which the author finds unacceptable. The fianc\u00e9's behavior includes repeated breaches of trust, even after promises to change. The author's actions, like checking his phone, might be seen as invasive, but the context is that she did so because of prior issues and a lack of trust.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's defense includes claims of accidental likes and efforts to unlike them, but the latest action of unblocking them seems intentional. The author felt compelled to leave after this, given the pattern of behavior. The question is whether her decision to end the relationship makes her at fault.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner repeatedly violates the trust through actions that the other finds intolerable, it's reasonable for the other to seek separation. The author isn't accusing of cheating, but the pattern of contact with another person despite promises could erode the relationship's foundation. The fianc\u00e9's inaction suggests he might not respect her boundaries, which is a valid reason for her to end things.\n\nSo, considering the context, the author isn't in the wrong. Her actions are a response to ongoing breaches of trust and broken promises. The answer should be B.\n"
