During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a fianc\u00e9e who left her partner after multiple instances where he maintained contact with a girl he's known for a long time, even after promises to cut ties. The key points here are the repeated breaches of trust and the author's decision to leave based on that.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for 7 years and has a child. The relationship had a past breakup where he talked to this girl, and after reconciling, the author expected him to stop contact. He did delete her once, but later it was found that he was still following her on social media, liking her pictures while not doing the same for the author. This pattern repeated: confrontation, promises to delete, then again finding contact after some time. The final straw was blocking and then unblocking them again.\n\nThe author is asking if she's in the wrong for leaving. The question is whether her action is justified. The main issue here is trust. Even without actual cheating, maintaining contact despite promises can be seen as a violation of trust. The partner's inability to cut ties, even after multiple chances, might lead to the author feeling that the relationship can't be trusted. \n\nIn relationships, especially long-term ones, trust and respect are crucial. If one partner can't honor their promises regarding contact with someone the other is uncomfortable with, it can be a deal-breaker. The author's decision to leave is a personal choice, and unless there's something that indicates she's overstepping (like if the contact wasn't a deal-breaker or if she had no evidence), she's probably not in the wrong. The fact that he went out of his way to unblock them again shows a pattern of dishonesty, which justifies her decision. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
