During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with their fianc\u00e9 because he keeps staying in contact with another girl. The author found out he was still connected to this girl and her sister on social media despite promises to cut contact. They have a child together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author feels betrayed and mistrustful because their fianc\u00e9 hasn't followed through on previous commitments to block the girl. The fianc\u00e9's actions might not involve cheating, but the constant contact could be seen as emotionally inappropriate, especially since they were broken up before and reconciled. The author's decision to end the relationship is based on trust issues and the inability to move past this.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 claims he didn't mean to keep liking the posts and tried to unlike them, which he says accidentally re-liked. He might be defensive and struggling with letting go of an old friendship. However, the repeated instances of not blocking the girl and her sister show a pattern of behavior that the author can't accept.\n\nTrust is a huge component in any relationship, especially a long-term one. If the author feels that their partner can't respect boundaries and keep commitments, it's hard to see how the relationship can continue healthily. The fact that there's a child involved adds another layer, but the author's well-being is also important. They might be making a tough decision to prioritize their own mental health and the future of their son, even if it means ending the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are the breach of trust, repeated broken promises, and the emotional impact on the author. Even without physical infidelity, the ongoing contact might be causing emotional harm. The author is justified in feeling that the relationship can't move forward without that trust. So, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
