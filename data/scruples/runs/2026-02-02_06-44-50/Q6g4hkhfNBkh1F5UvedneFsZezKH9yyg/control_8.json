During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The main issue is the fianc\u00e9's continued contact with another girl despite promises to stop.\n\nFirst, the relationship has been going on for seven years, and they have a child together. That's a significant amount of time and a family unit involved. The fianc\u00e9 had a month-long breakup, then got back together. The author expected the fianc\u00e9 to cut all contact with the girl, which seems reasonable if one partner is uncomfortable. The fianc\u00e9 initially deleted the girl but later kept reconnecting, even after being confronted multiple times. \n\nThe author snooped through the phone because they felt uneasy. While snooping isn't ideal, the context is that they were trying to address a trust issue. The fianc\u00e9 liked the girl's photos repeatedly, and even after promises to stop, he kept reconnecting. The final straw was unblocking them again. \n\nThe key points here are trust and repeated broken promises. Even without actual cheating, maintaining such contact can erode trust. The author is ending the relationship because they can't trust their partner anymore. The fianc\u00e9 claims he's trying to unlike the posts by accident, but the author has caught him in the same situation multiple times. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner can't respect the other's boundaries repeatedly, it's a significant problem. The author isn't accusing of cheating, just ongoing contact that they find unacceptable. Given the history of broken promises and the impact on trust, the decision to leave seems justified. The father of their child is involved, so the child's well-being is also a factor. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing to end the relationship when trust can't be maintained.\n"
