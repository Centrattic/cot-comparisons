During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario (the author) is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years, given the circumstances.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: They've been together seven years, have a child. Three years ago, they broke up for a month, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for most of his life. When they got back together, the author expected him to cut contact. He eventually deleted her but later continued to engage with her and even her sister. The author found evidence of likes on social media, which they didn't like, and confrontations led to no change. The fianc\u00e9 kept blocking and unblocking them, and the author felt they couldn't trust him anymore, leading to the decision to leave.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship. The main factors here are trust, communication, and the nature of the infidelity. The fianc\u00e9 hasn't actually cheated, but there's ongoing contact with another person that the author finds unacceptable. The author has tried multiple times to address the issue, and the fianc\u00e9 hasn't followed through on promises to cut ties. The author's decision is based on their inability to trust him anymore, which is a significant factor in a long-term relationship, especially with a child involved.\n\nLegally, in many places, you don't need proof of cheating to divorce. Emotionally, the trust issue is central. The author's actions are based on their feelings of betrayal and lack of respect for boundaries. The fianc\u00e9's actions, while not cheating, are still seen as a breach of trust. In such cases, it's often about what each person considers acceptable in a relationship. Since the author has made sincere efforts to resolve the issue without success, their decision to leave isn't necessarily wrong. The answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong, because the decision is based on trust and mutual respect, which are foundational in relationships.\n"
