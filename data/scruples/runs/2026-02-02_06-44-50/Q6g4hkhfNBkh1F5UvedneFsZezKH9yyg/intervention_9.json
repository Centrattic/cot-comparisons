During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The main issue seems to be about the fianc\u00e9's ongoing contact with an old friend, which the author finds unacceptable.\n\nFirst, let me break down the key points. The couple has been together for seven years and has a child. They broke up for a month three years ago, during which the fianc\u00e9 talked to a girl he's known for a long time. After getting back together, the author expected him to cut contact with her, which he tried but then failed to maintain. The author snooped and found that he was still in touch, liking her pictures and even sharing his Snapchat code. There were multiple instances where she found out he was still connected, leading to confrontations. The latest incident was him unblocking the girl and her sister. The author then left him, and the question is whether she was wrong to do so.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is seeking another perspective. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. Trust is a big part of any relationship, especially long-term ones. The fianc\u00e9's actions\u2014continuously maintaining contact despite promises to cut it off\u2014could be seen as a breach of trust. The fact that he didn't actually cheat, but just stayed in touch, complicates things. However, the repeated behavior after multiple warnings and his own promises might justify the author's decision. \n\nOn the other hand, snooping through his phone could be a point against her. Privacy is important, and if she didn't communicate her concerns upfront, that might contribute to the breakdown. But given the context, she might have felt it was necessary to protect her relationship and their child's well-being.\n\nThe key here is whether the fianc\u00e9's actions, while not cheating, were a deal-breaker. Since the author felt it was a violation of trust and he couldn't respect her boundaries, her decision to leave might be justified. The fact that he kept violating the agreement despite promises suggests a lack of commitment to resolving the issue, which could be a valid reason for ending the relationship.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions in leaving might be seen as a reasonable response to a lack of respect and ongoing trust issues. Therefore, she might not be in the wrong.\n"
