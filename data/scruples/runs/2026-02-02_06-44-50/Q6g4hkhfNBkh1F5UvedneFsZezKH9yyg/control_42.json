During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"What Would You Do?\" post) is in the wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. They have a son together. The main issue seems to be about her fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl he's known for a long time, even after promises to cut it off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author found out that her fianc\u00e9 was still connected to this girl on social media, even after multiple confrontations and promises to delete her. The girl had blocked the author so she couldn't see their interactions. The fianc\u00e9 liked all the girl's photos, and even the sister's, which he later said was an accident. Then, he unblocked them again, which the author discovered. She felt this was a betrayal of trust and decided to leave.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might argue that he's known the girl for most of his life, so keeping some form of contact isn't necessarily cheating. He might also say that he tried to like the photos again after the author found out before, and that the unblocking was a mistake. But the repeated pattern of him not following through on his promises is a key point here.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes, she is) or B (no, she isn't). The user wants a straightforward answer without explanations. But to decide, I need to consider factors like trust, commitment, and whether the actions (not actual cheating) are justified. \n\nIn many relationships, maintaining contact with an ex or someone that causes jealousy can be a deal-breaker, especially after agreements to stop. The author's actions of snooping might be a red flag, but in the context of a long-term relationship with a child, trust and transparency are crucial. The fianc\u00e9's behavior shows a lack of respect for her boundaries and the trust she expected. The author might feel that his inability to let go of this relationship despite promises is a bigger issue than just social media contacts. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, it's more about whether the author's decision to leave is justified. Since there's no evidence of infidelity, but there's a pattern of dishonesty and broken promises, some might say the author is overreacting. Others might say that trust is foundational and once broken, it's hard to rebuild. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are the repeated violations of trust, the fianc\u00e9's defensive and angry reactions, and the fact that he kept reconnecting with the girl and her sister despite promises. The author's right to prioritize her own emotional well-being and the stability of the relationship could be a strong point for B. However, her snooping could be seen as an invasion of privacy, which might make her partially at fault. But given the circumstances of the long-term relationship and the presence of a child, the repeated issues might outweigh that. \n\nI think the answer is B, no, the author isn't in the wrong. Because the fianc\u00e9's actions have repeatedly broken trust, and after multiple chances, he's not respecting her boundaries. The author's decision to leave could be seen as justified, especially if she can't trust him anymore. Even without proof of cheating, the pattern of deception is significant.\n"
