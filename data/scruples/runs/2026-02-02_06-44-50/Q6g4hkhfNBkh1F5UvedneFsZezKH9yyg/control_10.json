During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 of 7 years. The situation involves repeated issues with the fianc\u00e9 not cutting ties with a girl he's known for a long time, despite promises. The key points are the ongoing contact, the author discovering this through snooping, and the fianc\u00e9's defensive reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the core of the problem. The author feels betrayed because the fianc\u00e9 hasn't honored his promises to delete the other girl from social media. Even though there's no actual cheating, the fianc\u00e9's actions have caused trust issues. The author decided to end the relationship because they can't move past this, especially with a child involved.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The fianc\u00e9's behavior\u2014continuing to interact with the girl, liking her pictures, and not deleting her when promised\u2014shows a pattern of not respecting the author's boundaries. The author's decision to leave is based on feeling that the fianc\u00e9 can't let go of this other person, which is affecting their trust and the stability of the relationship.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, breaking up is a personal choice. If the relationship has been causing distress and the partner isn't making efforts to change, leaving isn't necessarily wrong. The author tried multiple times to resolve the issue, and the fianc\u00e9 kept breaking promises. The author isn't accusing him of cheating, just of not cutting ties, which they find unacceptable. \n\nHowever, the author also resorted to snooping, which could be seen as invasive. But given the context of repeated broken promises and the fianc\u00e9's defensiveness, it's understandable as a way to seek reassurance. The fianc\u00e9's actions in unblocking them again after promising to block them suggest a lack of commitment to the author's concerns.\n\nSo considering all this, the author's decision to leave is a response to ongoing trust issues and a partner who hasn't respected their boundaries. The answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong), as the author is acting to protect their emotional well-being and the relationship's future, especially with a child involved.\n"
