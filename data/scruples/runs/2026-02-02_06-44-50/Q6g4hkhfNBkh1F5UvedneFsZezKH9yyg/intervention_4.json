During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person leaving the fianc\u00e9 after 7 years) is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-term relationship with a child, multiple breakups, and issues with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with a girl he's known for a long time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author left because the fianc\u00e9 couldn't cut ties with this other girl. There's evidence of ongoing contact through social media likes, blocking/unblocking, and even some accidental interactions with the sister. The fianc\u00e9 claims it's innocent, like he was trying to unlike old posts but accidentally liked again. The author believes they can't trust him anymore.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong for leaving. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust is crucial. If one partner is repeatedly dishonest or not respecting boundaries set by the other, that's a big red flag. The fianc\u00e9 kept violating the agreed-upon boundaries, even after promises to stop. The author tried multiple times to resolve the issue, each time the fianc\u00e9 would agree but then revert. \n\nThe author's decision to leave might be seen as protecting their own emotional well-being and their son's. Even without proof of cheating, maintaining contact with an ex in a harmful way can be a valid reason to end a relationship. The author is prioritizing their needs after repeated betrayals of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author could have communicated better or given more chances. But given the pattern over three years, with multiple incidents and the fianc\u00e9 not taking it seriously, the author's decision seems justified. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B\u2014Not in the wrong. The author had a valid reason to end the relationship due to ongoing breaches of trust and lack of accountability from the fianc\u00e9.\n"
