During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the WIBTA post) is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The situation involves ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with a female friend, even after multiple promises to cut it off.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The couple has a long history, a child together. The fianc\u00e9 had an affair-like situation during a breakup, then they got back together. After that, the author discovered the fianc\u00e9 was still in contact with this girl, even after he promised to stop. The author snooped and found likes on social media, and eventually confronted him. Despite his promises, he kept reconnecting with her. The final straw was when he unblocked both her and her sister. The user is asking if the author is wrong for leaving.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The core issue is whether the author had valid reasons to leave. The fianc\u00e9's actions\u2014maintaining contact, not following through on promises, and reconnection after being asked to stop\u2014could be seen as a breach of trust. The author's decision to leave is based on these repeated issues, even though there's no proof of cheating. \n\nIn relationships, trust is fundamental. If one partner repeatedly violates the trust by not following through on agreements, even after multiple chances, it's reasonable for the other partner to feel that the relationship can't continue. The author might be justified in their decision, especially considering the long-term commitment and having a child together. However, some might argue that the author could have handled it differently, like seeking counseling or giving more chances. But given the pattern of behavior and the fianc\u00e9's unwillingness to change despite promises, the author's choice to leave might be seen as protecting their own well-being and their child's stability.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The repeated violations and the fianc\u00e9's failure to honor commitments are significant enough to justify leaving, even without proof of actual infidelity. The author's actions are a response to chronic issues that undermined the relationship's trust and stability.\n"
