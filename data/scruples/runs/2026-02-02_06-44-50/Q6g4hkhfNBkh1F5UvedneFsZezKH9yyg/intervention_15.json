During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with her fianc\u00e9. The situation involves ongoing issues with him maintaining contact with another girl, which the author finds unacceptable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts presented. The couple has a child together and has been engaged for seven years. There was a breakup three years ago, during which the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for most of his life. After reconciling, the author expected him to cut contact, which he initially did but then resumed. The author snooped and found out he was still in touch, liked her photos, and even had her sister's posts liked. The fianc\u00e9 gave various explanations, like accidentally re-liking or trying to unlike them, but the author found him unblocking them again recently.\n\nNow, the key points here are trust and communication. The author feels that the fianc\u00e9 hasn't respected her boundaries by maintaining contact with another woman, which is causing her distress. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, might believe that just talking to a friend isn't cheating, hence his defensive and angry reactions when confronted. The author took the extreme step of leaving, which is significant given the long-term relationship and shared child.\n\nI need to assess whether the author overreacted. The fianc\u00e9's actions\u2014keeping contact, liking photos, unblocking\u2014could be seen as emotional infidelity or at least a breach of trust. The author's decision to leave is based on not being able to trust him anymore. However, there's no direct evidence of cheating, just ongoing contact. The question is whether that's a valid reason to end a relationship.\n\nIn some relationships, maintaining contact with exes or close friends is acceptable, but if it causes distress and the other partner doesn't respect boundaries, it becomes an issue. The author tried multiple times to address the issue, and the fianc\u00e9 kept violating her trust. The author's actions might be justified as protecting her emotional well-being, even if it means ending the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might argue that he's not doing anything wrong, just keeping a friendship. But in the context of a committed relationship, such actions can be seen as crossing a line, especially if the partner is uncomfortable. The author's right to set boundaries and leave if those boundaries aren't respected is important. The fact that there's no cheating but persistent breaches might still be a deal-breaker for her.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's decision isn't necessarily wrong. She's making a choice based on her comfort and the trust in the relationship. The fianc\u00e9's inability to respect her boundaries despite repeated warnings could be the root issue. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's acting to protect herself from ongoing hurt.\n"
