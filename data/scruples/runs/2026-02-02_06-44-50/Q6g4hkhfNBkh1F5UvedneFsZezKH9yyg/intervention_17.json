During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is ending a 7-year engagement with her fianc\u00e9 because he can't cut off contact with a girl he's known for a long time. They have a child together.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. They broke up for a month three years ago, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to this girl. They reconciled, but the author expected him to cut contact. He deleted her but then later the author found he was still interacting with her and even liked pictures of her sister. He kept promising to delete her, and each time, the author caught him backsliding. Finally, she leaves him.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user says they think the author is in the wrong, but wants others' opinions. So I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the fianc\u00e9 is maintaining contact despite promises to cut off. The author has evidence of him liking the girl's and her sister's posts, not deleting them as agreed. This could be seen as a lack of commitment to the relationship, breaking trust, and not respecting the partner's boundaries. The fact that he kept unblocking them after promising to block them might indicate a pattern of dishonesty or inability to prioritize the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 claims he didn't mean to like the posts and was trying to unlike them. Also, there's no actual proof of cheating, just social media interactions. Maybe the author's snoopiness and the fianc\u00e9's inability to fully cut off contact (even if it's innocent) led to the breakdown. But the repeated pattern of breaking promises could be a deal-breaker. \n\nTrust is a big component here. If the fianc\u00e9 can't honor his commitments, that's a problem. The author's decision to end the engagement might be justified as protecting herself from ongoing betrayal. The presence of a child complicates things, but the author's well-being is also important.\n\nSo considering all that, the author's actions are understandable. The fianc\u00e9's behavior, even if not cheating, shows a lack of respect for the author's boundaries and trust. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for leaving. Answer B.\n"
