During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9 having contact with an old friend (a girl he's known for most of his life), which the author finds problematic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple has a child together, which adds emotional weight. The author found out that the fianc\u00e9 had been keeping this girl on his social media, even after promises to delete her. There's a pattern here\u2014after each confrontation, the fianc\u00e9 deletes her, but then later, the contact resumes. The author even snooped through his phone and found likes on the girl's pictures, and later her sister's. The fianc\u00e9 gives explanations, like accidentally re-liking posts, but the author doesn't believe him anymore.\n\nNow, the author is considering ending the relationship because of this ongoing issue. The question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but wants another opinion. \n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the fianc\u00e9 hasn't followed through on his promises to cut contact, and there's a pattern of deceit. The author had to snoop each time, which suggests a lack of trust. Also, maintaining contact with an ex or a close friend can be a red flag, especially if it's a source of conflict. The author's actions might be seen as justified if she feels her trust is repeatedly broken and the relationship can't move forward without honesty.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the fianc\u00e9 isn't cheating, just maintaining a friendship. But the context here is that the author found specific instances where he liked the girl's posts, not hers, and the girl promoted his Snapchat, which could imply more than a casual friendship. The repeated breaking of promises to delete her adds to the problem. The author might feel that her needs for trust and exclusivity aren't being met, which is crucial in a long-term relationship, especially when there's a child involved.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's behavior might be seen as emotionally unfaithful, even if there's no physical cheating. Emotional infidelity can erode a relationship just as much. The author's decision to leave could be based on the inability to trust her partner, which is a valid reason. Given that this has happened multiple times and there's no sign of change, ending the relationship might be a necessary step for her well-being.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. Her actions stem from a place of trying to protect the relationship and her own emotional health. The fianc\u00e9's inconsiderate actions and lack of follow-through on promises could make the author's decision justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
