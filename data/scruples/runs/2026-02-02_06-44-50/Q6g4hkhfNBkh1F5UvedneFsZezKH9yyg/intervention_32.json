During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with her fianc\u00e9 because he kept staying in contact with another girl, even though there's no evidence of cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The couple has been together for seven years and has a child. They broke up for a month three years ago, during which the fianc\u00e9 talked to a girl he's known for a long time. After getting back together, the author wanted him to cut off contact, which he did temporarily. Then, the author snooped and found he was still in touch, even liking her pictures on social media. This happened multiple times, and after each incident, he promised to delete her, but didn't. Finally, the author left him because he couldn't stop contacting this girl and her sister.\n\nThe key points here are trust, repeated breaches of boundaries, and the emotional impact. The author felt betrayed that he couldn't cut off contact despite promises. Even though there's no proof of cheating, the ongoing contact and the fianc\u00e9's defensive behavior (like unblocking them again) suggest a lack of respect for the author's feelings and boundaries. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9's actions might indicate emotional unavailability or infidelity in the form of emotional attachment, even without physical cheating. The author had to take matters into her own hands due to the lack of trust, which is understandable. Ending a relationship over repeated breaches of trust, especially when it's causing emotional distress, is a personal decision. \n\nGiven that the author has a child with him, the situation is complex, but the main issue is whether staying in contact with another person in this way is a deal-breaker. Since the fianc\u00e9 kept breaking promises and the author couldn't trust him anymore, her decision to leave might be justified. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
