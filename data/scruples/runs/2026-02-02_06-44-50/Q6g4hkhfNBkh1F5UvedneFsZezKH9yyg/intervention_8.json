During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The situation involves ongoing contact with another girl, which the author finds unacceptable.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The couple has a 6-year-old son and has been together for seven years. They broke up briefly, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for a long time. After getting back together, the author expected him to cut off contact, which he did initially but then continued secretly. The author checked his phone and found he was still in contact, leading to confrontations and a cycle of breaking up and getting back together. The latest issue is that he unblocked the girl and her sister on social media, prompting the author to leave.\n\nThe author is asking if they are wrong for ending the relationship because the fianc\u00e9 can't cut off contact with another girl, even though there's no evidence of cheating just yet. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nHmm. So, is the author in the wrong? Well, the fianc\u00e9 has repeatedly failed to honor the author's boundaries by maintaining contact with the girl despite agreements to delete her. The author feels betrayed and can't trust him anymore. The relationship has been strained for a while, and the author is prioritizing their own well-being and their child's stability. Ending a relationship after seven years because of a partner's inability to respect agreed-upon boundaries might be a personal choice, but whether it's 'wrong' depends on ethical perspectives.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, their trust has been broken multiple times, and they've made efforts to resolve the issue but it keeps recurring. The fianc\u00e9's actions suggest a lack of commitment to the relationship's exclusivity. The author has a right to feel disrespected and to seek a life where they are not constantly worried about their partner's loyalty.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author's snooping into the phone could be seen as a breach of privacy, but given the context of the ongoing conflict and the fianc\u00e9's secrecy, it might be understandable. The key here is mutual respect for each other's boundaries. The fianc\u00e9 repeatedly violated the author's boundaries, so the author's decision to leave is a response to those violations.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing to end the relationship when trust and agreement can't be maintained. The answer would be B (No).\n"
