During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"What Would You Do\" scenario is in the wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The situation involves ongoing issues with her fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another woman despite promises to cut it off. The author snoop through his phone multiple times and found evidence of ongoing contact, leading her to leave. The user thinks the author might be in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects. The key points are the duration of the relationship, the presence of a child, and the recurring breaches of trust. The fianc\u00e9 has a history of not following through on promises to cut ties with the other woman. The author felt the need to check his phone multiple times, which might be seen as invasive, but her motivation was due to repeated broken promises.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner is repeatedly dishonest or doesn't respect boundaries, it can lead to justified feelings of betrayal. The fianc\u00e9's actions could be seen as a pattern of deceit. Even if there's no actual cheating, the continuous contact and inability to respect the partner's wishes can erode trust over time.\n\nOn the other hand, the author snoop several times, which might be considered a violation of privacy. However, given the context of a long-term relationship with broken commitments, some might argue it's a last resort to find the truth. The decision to leave after multiple instances of the fianc\u00e9 not following through could be seen as self-preservation, especially considering the child involved.\n\nThe question is whether the author's actions are wrong. If the fianc\u00e9's behavior is a consistent issue, then the author's decision might be understandable. However, if the author used snooping as a recurring method, that could be problematic. But given the circumstances, prioritizing her well-being and her child's environment might justify the decision.\n\nSo, putting it together: The author isn't in the wrong because the fianc\u00e9's ongoing deceit and inability to honor commitments created a situation where trust couldn't be maintained, and leaving was a reasonable response to protect herself and her child.\n"
