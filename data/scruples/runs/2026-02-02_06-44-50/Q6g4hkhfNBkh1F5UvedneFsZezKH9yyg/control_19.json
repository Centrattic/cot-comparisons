During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" scenario is in the wrong when leaving their fianc\u00e9 of 7 years. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl he's known for a long time, even after promises to stop. The author snoop-checked his phone, found likes on her photos and potentially her sister's, and now he's unblocked them again. The key here is that there's no direct evidence of cheating, just ongoing contact and possibly some deceit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together for a long time and has a child. The fianc\u00e9 had a history of this issue, even after previous breakups and promises. The author's actions of snooping might be seen as invasive, but given the circumstances, maybe justified if they felt betrayed. The fianc\u00e9's behavior shows a pattern of not following through on commitments, which is a red flag. The author is prioritizing their own mental well-being and the trust in the relationship by leaving, which is a significant decision.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. In relationships, trust is crucial. If the fianc\u00e9 can't stop contacting someone he used to be close with, even after multiple confrontations and promises, that's a big issue. The author isn't accusing him of cheating directly, but the consistent patterns of behavior (not deleting, re-liking, unblocking) suggest a lack of respect for the author's feelings and boundaries. The author might feel that their trust can't be rebuilt, so ending the relationship isn't just about the last incident but the ongoing pattern.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is overreacting, especially without concrete proof of infidelity. Snooping could be seen as a breach of privacy. But the fianc\u00e9's actions also breach trust by not honoring his commitments. The author is making a choice based on the cumulative effect of these actions. They have a right to feel that their partner isn't able to meet their emotional needs, especially in a long-term commitment with a child involved.\n\nSo, the decision to leave might be seen as justified because the fianc\u00e9's behavior is recurrent and undermines the relationship's foundation. The lack of cheating evidence doesn't negate the trust issues and broken promises. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
