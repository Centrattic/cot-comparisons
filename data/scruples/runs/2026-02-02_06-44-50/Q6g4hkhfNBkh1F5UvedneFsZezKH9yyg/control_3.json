During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the WIBTA question is in the wrong for breaking up with their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The situation involves ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl he's known for a long time.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple has been together for seven years and has a child. Three years ago, they broke up for a month, during which the fianc\u00e9 started talking to this girl. After reconciling, the author expected him to cut contact, which he did temporarily but later resumed. The author snooped and found evidence of him liking the girl's social media posts, which he didn't do for the author. They fought about it, he deleted her, but she was still there after a month. Then, the author found likes on the girl's sister's posts, and now she's unblocked again.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is justified in ending the relationship. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. The fianc\u00e9 hasn't been honest, even after multiple instances where the author confronted him. He kept the contact going despite promises to delete and block. The author has evidence of ongoing contact, which suggests a pattern of behavior that breaches trust. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 had to unblock them recently shows a deliberate choice to reconnect, which the author might see as a deal-breaker.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the fianc\u00e9 doesn't see these actions as a big deal. He might argue that it's just social media contact and not actual cheating. But the author feels hurt and betrayed. Since there's no evidence of physical cheating, does that make the author wrong for leaving? \n\nI think in this context, the author's feelings are valid. The repeated breaches of trust, even without physical infidelity, can erode a relationship. The author might have felt that they couldn't trust their partner, leading to the decision to end the relationship. The fact that there's a child involved adds complexity, but the author is still justified in seeking a relationship where trust is present.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The key factors are the ongoing deceit, broken promises, and the impact on trust. Even without cheating, maintaining contact that the partner finds unacceptable can be a valid reason to leave, especially after multiple attempts to resolve the issue.\n"
