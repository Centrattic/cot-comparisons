During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship. The situation is complicated. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for 7 years with a child. They broke up for a month three years ago, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for most of his life. They reconciled, and the author expected him to cut all contact. When he didn't, they fought, and he eventually deleted her. But then the author found out later that he was still in contact, liking her photos, and even the sister's. He kept promising to delete them, but the author kept finding them again. The final straw was when he unblocked both the girl and her sister.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving. The author has evidence of ongoing contact despite promises to cut it off. The fianc\u00e9 hasn't actually cheated, just stayed in touch and maybe liked some posts. The author feels betrayed and can't trust him anymore. Since trust is a cornerstone of a relationship, especially with a child involved, the author's decision might be justified. The fianc\u00e9's actions show a pattern of dishonesty and lack of respect for boundaries. Even without physical cheating, emotional betrayal can be a deal-breaker. The author has tried to resolve the issue multiple times, giving him chances to correct his behavior, but it keeps recurring. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
