During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a 7-year engagement that's ending because the fianc\u00e9 keeps staying in contact with another girl, even after promises to cut it off. The author found evidence of him liking her photos on social media, not deleting her, and even unblocking her again recently. The fianc\u00e9 says he's trying but made mistakes.\n\nFirst, the key points here are trust and boundaries in a relationship. The author felt it was understandable to ask the fianc\u00e9 to cut contact with this girl after the breakup. The fianc\u00e9 agreed but then didn't follow through despite multiple confrontations. The author then decided to leave because of the repeated breaches of trust, even though there's no proof of cheating beyond the contact. \n\nIn relationships, especially long-term ones, trust is crucial. If one partner keeps breaking the agreed-upon boundaries, the other is justified in feeling betrayed. The fianc\u00e9's actions\u2014continuing contact, lying about deleting, and then unblocking\u2014show a pattern of not respecting the author's feelings and boundaries. The fact that he even went out of his way to unblock them shows intent to maintain that connection, which could be seen as a betrayal of the relationship's trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might argue that he's trying and that there's no actual cheating. But the author has the right to establish boundaries, and the fianc\u00e9's inability or unwillingness to respect those could be a deal-breaker. The author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship when trust is repeatedly broken, even if there's no physical infidelity. Emotional fidelity is also important in a committed relationship.\n\nSo the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
