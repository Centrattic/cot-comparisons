During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with her fianc\u00e9 over his continued contact with another girl, even though there's no evidence of cheating. \n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together 7 years, have a child. They broke up for a month three years ago, and during that time he started talking to a girl he's known for a long time. They got back together, and the author expected him to cut contact. He didn't, leading to arguments. She snooped and found he was still following her on social media, even liking her pictures. He promised to delete her, but she found him still following, then liked the sister's posts. Now, he's unblocked both the girl and her sister again.\n\nThe key points here are about trust and boundaries. In a committed relationship, especially a long-term one, partners often set boundaries about contact with exes or others. The author felt betrayed that he wasn't respecting her request to cut ties, even after multiple promises. The fact that he went out of his way to unblock them again might indicate a lack of commitment to her trust.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not). \n\nArguments for A (she's wrong): Maybe she snooped, which can be seen as invading his privacy. However, the context here is that she had previous concerns and he wasn't transparent. Repeated issues might justify her actions. Also, the question isn't about her snooping being wrong, but whether ending the relationship is wrong.\n\nArguments for B (she's not wrong): The fianc\u00e9 repeatedly broke trust by not cutting contact, despite promises. The author felt her boundaries were disrespected, leading to loss of trust. Ending the relationship because of consistent breaches, even without cheating, can be seen as a valid decision given the lack of progress.\n\nThe scenario is about ongoing issues where the fianc\u00e9's actions (maintaining contact, deleting then re-following, etc.) indicate he's not taking her concerns seriously. The author's decision to leave is based on trust issues, which are significant in a relationship. Without cheating, it's more about emotional infidelity or respect for boundaries. Depending on cultural or personal views, some might say she's not wrong because maintaining boundaries is essential. Others might argue that without actual cheating, it's too harsh, but the repeated pattern suggests a deeper problem.\n\nConsidering the evidence she has (likes, following, unblocking), and the fact that he's not taking her seriously, her decision is understandable. Thus, the answer is likely B.\n"
