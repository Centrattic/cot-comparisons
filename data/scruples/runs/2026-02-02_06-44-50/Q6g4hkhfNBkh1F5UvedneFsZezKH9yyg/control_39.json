During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is a 7-year engagement where the author is leaving their fianc\u00e9 because of ongoing issues with him not cutting off contact with another girl. They have a son together, which adds another layer of complexity.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 and the girl have known each other for most of their lives. The couple broke up briefly, got back together, and the author expected the fianc\u00e9 to stop contact with the girl. He did delete her initially, but later the author found out they were still connected through social media. The author snooped in the phone and found that the fianc\u00e9 had liked all the girl's pictures, not the author's, and the girl had blocked the author to hide this. After confrontations, the fianc\u00e9 said he would delete her, but she ended up being unblocked again. Recently, the author found out that he had liked the girl's sister's posts and then accidentally liked them again. Finally, the fianc\u00e9 unblocked both the girl and her sister, leading the author to break off the engagement.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is justified in ending the relationship because of the fianc\u00e9's continued contact with another woman, even without definitive proof of cheating. The author hasn't found any evidence of actual infidelity, just persistent communication and social media interactions.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and expectations in relationships, trust and fidelity are crucial. Even if there's no cheating, maintaining contact with someone that causes significant distress to the partner can be a problem. The fianc\u00e9's actions seem to repeatedly breach the boundaries the author set. Every time the author confronts him, he promises to stop, but then continues the behavior. This pattern of breaking promises might indicate a lack of respect for the author's feelings and the relationship's integrity.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 claims that some actions were accidental, like reliking posts. However, the consistent pattern over years suggests intentionality. The author's decision to leave is based on the cumulative effect of these actions, which have eroded trust and caused emotional harm. Given that they have a child together, co-parenting might be necessary, but the author is ending the engagement, not the parenting relationship.\n\nThe key points here are the repeated breaches of trust, the fianc\u00e9's failure to address the issue despite multiple warnings, and the author's right to feel secure and trusted in the relationship. The author isn't wrong for seeking to leave a relationship where trust has been repeatedly broken, even if there's no physical cheating. The emotional impact and the lack of resolution from the fianc\u00e9's side support the author's decision.\n"
