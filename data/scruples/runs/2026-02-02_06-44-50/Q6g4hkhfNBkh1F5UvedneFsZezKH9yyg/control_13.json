During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a 7-year engagement with a son and multiple breakups over the years. The key points are about the fianc\u00e9's contact with another girl he's known for a long time.\n\nFirst, the author discovered that the fianc\u00e9 had been in contact with this girl, even after agreeing to cut contact. The author snoop-checked the phone and found likes on her posts, then again later found the girl and her sister unblocked. The fianc\u00e9 claims it was accidental or not intentional. The author is ending the engagement because of this ongoing issue.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong to end the relationship. The user wants a yes or no answer, A or B. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The fianc\u00e9's actions\u2014like liking the girl's posts, not deleting her as agreed, and even unblocking her after promising to block\u2014could be seen as breaches of trust. The author has a child with their partner, so this is a long-term commitment. If the fianc\u00e9 is unable to cut ties with another person despite repeated assurances, that could indicate a pattern of dishonesty or lack of commitment to the relationship.\n\nThe author is in a tough spot, but they have valid reasons for feeling betrayed. Even if there's no actual cheating, the emotional infidelity and lack of transparency can justify ending the relationship. The fianc\u00e9's inability to follow through on his promises might make the author feel that their trust can't be rebuilt. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for breaking up over these issues, especially considering the repeated occurrences and the impact on their mental state.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have addressed the issue differently, like through counseling before ending things. But given the repeated incidents and the fianc\u00e9's lack of action to resolve them, the author's decision seems justified. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
