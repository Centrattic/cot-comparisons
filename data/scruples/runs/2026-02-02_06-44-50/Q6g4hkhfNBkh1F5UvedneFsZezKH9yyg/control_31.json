During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a 7-year engagement with a son, and the author is considering leaving because their fianc\u00e9 is still in contact with a girl he's known for a long time. They broke up once for a month, and during that time he started talking to this girl. When they got back together, the author expected him to cut contact, which he did initially but then continued secretly.\n\nThe key points here are the repeated instances where the author finds the fianc\u00e9 still connected to this girl and her sister. The author checks the phone, finds likes on the girl's pictures, etc. Each time the fianc\u00e9 promises to delete her but doesn't follow through. The author is frustrated because even though there's no actual proof of cheating, the ongoing contact is causing trust issues. The author's main concern is that the fianc\u00e9 can't let go of this other person, leading to repeated betrayals of trust.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship. The options are A for yes and B for no. \n\nFirst, in relationships, trust is fundamental. If one partner consistently breaches that trust by maintaining contact with someone the other finds threatening, even if it's not physical infidelity, it can be a deal-breaker. The fianc\u00e9 kept breaking promises to cut ties, which would be really hurtful. The author's actions of checking the phone might be a red flag, but given the context of repeated breaches, it's understandable. The author isn't accusing of cheating but of emotional infidelity or at least a lack of commitment to the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might argue that he's not cheating, and the author is being overly controlling. But the pattern here is of not respecting boundaries set by the author. The author has a right to feel that their trust is not being respected, especially since the fianc\u00e9 went out of his way to unblock them again. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's decision to leave seems justified because the trust is irreparably broken. The fianc\u00e9's actions show a pattern that the author can't accept, even without physical cheating. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
