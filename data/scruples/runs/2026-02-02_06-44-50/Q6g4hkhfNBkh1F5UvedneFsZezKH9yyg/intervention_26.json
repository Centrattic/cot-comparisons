During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Will I Be The Asshole\" (WIBTA) post is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The situation involves ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with an ex-friend and her sister. The author has tried multiple times to address this, leading up to their decision to end the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key elements. The couple has a son, which adds emotional weight. The fianc\u00e9 broke up temporarily three years ago, then reunited, but the author expected him to cut contact with the other girl. He did delete her initially but then reconnected later, despite promises. The author snooped and found ongoing interactions, leading to confrontations and cycles of breaking up and reconciling. The final incident was unblocking the girl and her sister again.\n\nThe author is justified in feeling hurt and betrayed, especially since the fianc\u00e9 kept breaking his promises. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. \n\nI need to consider the context: ongoing infidelity (though there's no actual cheating, just contact), lack of trust, and repeated broken promises. The author tried multiple times to resolve the issue, but the fianc\u00e9 didn't follow through. Leaving a long-term relationship over a partner not respecting boundaries is often seen as reasonable. The author's actions (snooping) might be seen as invasive, but it's understandable given the circumstances. The fianc\u00e9's behavior shows a pattern of dishonesty and disrespect for the author's feelings. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They had valid reasons to end the relationship given the lack of progress and continued breaches of trust. Answer B.\n"
