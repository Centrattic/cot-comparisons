During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The situation is about infidelity, but not exactly cheating. The fianc\u00e9 has been in contact with a girl he's known for a long time. The author found out he was still following her on social media, liking her pictures, and even the sister. They had arguments, he promised to delete her, but kept re-adding her. The author left because they can't trust him anymore, even though there's no proof of actual cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The relationship has a child, which complicates things. The fianc\u00e9's actions might not be physical cheating, but emotional or social cheating. The author is hurt because he keeps breaking promises to cut contact. The fianc\u00e9's behavior shows a lack of respect for the author's boundaries. Even if he didn't cheat, the continuous deceit and inability to respect the relationship's exclusivity is a problem. The author has a right to feel betrayed, especially when he unblocks them again. The fact that he's been unfaithful in communication, even if not physically, might justify the author's decision. Since there's no proof of cheating, but there's consistent breaking of trust, the author's decision could be seen as justified. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
