During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for breaking up with her fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The key points here are the ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl despite promises to stop, the author's discovery of continued interactions, and the decision to leave.\n\nFirst, the relationship has been long-term, which means trust and communication are crucial. The fianc\u00e9 broke up with her once before, then got back together, but there was an issue with contact with the other girl. The author felt that cutting off contact was necessary, which is understandable in a committed relationship. When the fianc\u00e9 didn't follow through, it caused repeated conflicts.\n\nThe author snoop through his phone, which might be a point of contention. While snooping isn't ideal, given the history of deception, her concern is valid. Finding the girl's likes and the sister's likes, along with the fianc\u00e9's refusal to delete them, suggests a pattern of not being truthful. The fianc\u00e9's excuses about accidentally liking the sister's posts might not hold up, especially since the author found them unblocked again intentionally.\n\nThe decision to leave is based on the accumulation of these issues over time. Even without proof of cheating, the fianc\u00e9's inability to respect boundaries and his repeated dishonesty could justify the breakup. The author is prioritizing her own well-being and the integrity of the relationship, which is important.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author could have addressed the issue differently, maybe through counseling or giving more chances. But with a seven-year history and multiple failed attempts to resolve the same problem, it's reasonable to conclude that the fianc\u00e9 isn't committed to changing. The author is protecting herself from ongoing emotional harm.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's actions have been the main issue here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
