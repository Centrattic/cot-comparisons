During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. The situation involves multiple instances where the fianc\u00e9 has continued contact with another girl despite promises to cut it off.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The couple has been together for 7 years, has a child, and the fianc\u00e9 has had a history of not cutting ties with this girl even after explicit requests. The author found evidence of ongoing contact, including liking photos and not deleting the girl from social media as agreed. The fianc\u00e9 gave multiple promises to stop, but each time relapsed. The author eventually leaves, and the question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nThe user wants a decision between A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). I need to assess if the author's actions are justified. The author is ending a long-term relationship over trust issues. The fianc\u00e9's actions suggest a pattern of dishonesty and inability to respect boundaries. The author has tried multiple times to resolve the issue, but it keeps recurring. The key here is whether the author is overreacting or justified in leaving due to lack of trust.\n\nIn relationships, trust is fundamental. If one partner repeatedly violates the other's trust, even without physical infidelity, it can be valid to end the relationship. The fianc\u00e9's behavior shows a lack of commitment to the relationship, as he continues contact with another person despite promises. The author's decision to leave could be seen as a response to broken trust and the inability to resolve the issue.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is being too strict, especially if there's no actual cheating. But given the persistent pattern and the fianc\u00e9's refusal to change despite multiple chances, the author's choice might be justified. The author is prioritizing their own emotional well-being and the health of the relationship, which is understandable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
