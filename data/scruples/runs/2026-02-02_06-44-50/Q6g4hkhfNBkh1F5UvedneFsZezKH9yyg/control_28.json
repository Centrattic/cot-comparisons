During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a fianc\u00e9 who's been in a 7-year relationship with someone, and they have a child together. They broke up for a month three years ago during which the fianc\u00e9 started talking to an old friend. When they got back together, the author expected the fianc\u00e9 to cut off contact with that girl. The fianc\u00e9 did delete her initially, but then later reconnected. The author found out through snooping that the fianc\u00e9 was still in contact, liking the girl's social media posts, even while the author's weren't being liked. The fianc\u00e9 then promised to delete her again, but the author checked later and found the contact still there. After another incident with the girl's sister, the author left the relationship. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is the fianc\u00e9's continued contact with an ex-friend, which the author finds unacceptable. The author has tried multiple times to address this, and each time the fianc\u00e9 promised to fix it, but it kept recurring. The author eventually left because they felt the fianc\u00e9 couldn't let go of the connection, even though there's no proof of cheating, just ongoing contact against the author's wishes.\n\nIn relationships, trust and boundaries are crucial. If one partner consistently violates the other's boundaries despite promises, that can be a valid reason to end the relationship. The author felt the fianc\u00e9 wasn't respecting their feelings and boundaries, leading to repeated breaches of trust. Even without physical cheating, emotional infidelity or feeling unsafe in the relationship can justify leaving. The author's actions, while involving snooping, might be seen as a last resort due to the fianc\u00e9's dishonesty and repeated failures to comply with the agreed-upon boundaries. The fianc\u00e9's behavior showed a lack of commitment to the relationship, making the author's decision understandable. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
