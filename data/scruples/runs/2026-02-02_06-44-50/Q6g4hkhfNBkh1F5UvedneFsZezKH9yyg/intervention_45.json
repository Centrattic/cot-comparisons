During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The main issue seems to be about the fianc\u00e9's continued contact with another girl, despite promises to cut it off.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the timeline. They broke up briefly three years ago, during which he talked to this girl. They got back together, and the author expected him to stop contact. He deleted her from social media but later reconnected, especially after being confronted. The author snooped and found he was still liking her posts, then later even unblocked her and the sister. The key points are that there's no evidence of cheating, just ongoing contact despite assurances.\n\nThe author is ending the relationship because she feels betrayed by his inability to cut ties, even though there's no actual infidelity. The question is whether she's wrong to do so. \n\nFrom one angle, trust is a big part of a relationship. If someone repeatedly breaks promises about cutting off contact with an ex or someone else, it can erode trust. The author has tried multiple times to resolve this, and each time he hasn't followed through. This could be seen as a lack of commitment or respect for her boundaries. Ending the relationship because of broken trust might be justified, especially when there are repeated violations.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that contact with another person isn't cheating. If he hasn't crossed into physical or emotional infidelity, maybe the author is overreacting. But given the context\u2014likes, blocking/unblocking, and the sister's involvement\u2014there might be emotional boundaries being crossed. The fact that he's the father of her child and they've been together seven years means the stakes are high. The author's decision to leave could be about protecting herself from ongoing betrayal and ensuring a stable environment for their son.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. Her feelings of betrayal and the need to set boundaries are valid. Repeated broken promises can be a deal-breaker, even without actual cheating. The answer should be B (No).\n"
