During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The situation involves ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with an ex-girlfriend and her sister, which the author found out through snooping.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple has a 6-year-old son, so there's a child involved, which complicates things. The fianc\u00e9 had a previous breakup where he started talking to a girl he knew for most of his life. After getting back together, the author expected him to cut contact, which he initially did. But then he kept reconnecting, even after multiple confrontations. The author found evidence of him liking her and her sister's posts on social media, and the fianc\u00e9's explanations didn't satisfy the author. The final straw was unblocking them again.\n\nThe author's main issue is that the fianc\u00e9 can't seem to sever contact with another person, which is causing trust issues. The question is whether leaving is justified without actual proof of cheating. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but others might argue the opposite.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The author tried to address the issue multiple times, and the fianc\u00e9 kept reverting to the same behavior. Even though there's no direct cheating, consistent contact with an ex can be a red flag, especially if it causes emotional distress. The author's decision to leave might be seen as a response to the loss of trust and repeated broken promises, which can be valid reasons. However, some might think the author should have handled it differently, maybe through counseling instead of breaking up.\n\nBut considering the repeated instances where the fianc\u00e9 didn't follow through on his promises to cut contact, and the author's attempts to resolve it without success, it's a tough call. The presence of a child might suggest that staying together for the child's sake is important, but the health of the relationship is also a factor. If the relationship is toxic or built on deceit, ending it could be necessary even for the child's well-being.\n\nIn this case, since the author made multiple efforts to address the issue and the fianc\u00e9 kept violating boundaries, it's reasonable to see the author's decision as valid. The answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because the author had legitimate concerns about trust and the fianc\u00e9's inability to respect those boundaries, leading to the decision to leave.\n"
