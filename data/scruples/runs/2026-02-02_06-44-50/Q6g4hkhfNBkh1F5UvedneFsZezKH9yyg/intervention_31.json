During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with her fianc\u00e9. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with an old friend (a girl he's known for most of his life) despite the author's requests to cut off contact. The author found evidence that he liked her photos on social media, and later even unblocked her and her sister. There's no mention of actual cheating, just ongoing communication that the author found unacceptable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The relationship is long-term, with a child together. The main conflict is about boundaries and trust. The fianc\u00e9 allegedly didn't follow through on promises to cut off contact, leading to repeated confrontations and ultimately the author deciding to leave. \n\nThe author's perspective is that the fianc\u00e9 can't let go of this other girl, even after multiple requests and incidents. The fianc\u00e9's defense might be that he's maintaining a friendship, not an affair. However, the actions (liking photos, not deleting contacts) suggest a level of engagement that the author finds harmful or disrespectful. \n\nThe key points: 1) The author has evidence of ongoing contact despite promises. 2) The fianc\u00e9's actions (even if not cheating) eroded trust. 3) The author is ending the relationship based on these breaches of trust. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. Some might argue the author is justified in prioritizing her own emotional well-being and trust. Others might say the fianc\u00e9's actions (without actual cheating) don't warrant ending a long-term relationship. However, since the author has the right to her own boundaries and feelings, and the fianc\u00e9 repeatedly violated her trust, it's a situation where breaking up could be seen as reasonable. \n\nI should also consider if the author snooped, which is a point against her, but the context is that she did so because of prior incidents. The fianc\u00e9's transparency (or lack thereof) is also an issue. Without cheating, it's hard to say it's objectively \"right\" or \"wrong,\" but the author's decision is based on valid concerns about trust and respect in the relationship. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong because the situation involves breaches of trust and boundaries that she found unacceptable, leading her to make a difficult decision based on her own needs and the relationship's health.\n"
