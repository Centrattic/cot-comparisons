During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. The key points here are the ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl, the author snooping through his phone, and the final incident where he unblocked both the girl and her sister.\n\nFirst, the context: They have a child together. The relationship has been strained for three years, with breakups and reconciliations. The main issue is the fianc\u00e9's continued contact with a long-time acquaintance. The author found out he was still interacting with her through social media likes, even after he deleted her. Then, he unblocked her and her sister again.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. The author's actions involve snooping, which can be a breach of trust. However, the fianc\u00e9's behavior is questionable too\u2014keeping contact even after promises to delete. The final straw was unblocking them, which might be seen as a deliberate choice to reconnect, despite previous agreements. \n\nThe question is whether the author overreacted. Trust is crucial in a long-term relationship, especially when there's a child involved. If the fianc\u00e9 repeatedly breaks promises about cutting ties, that could erode trust. The author might feel betrayed, even without proof of cheating. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 hasn't actually admitted to cheating but is accused of not letting go. The act of unblocking could be innocent, like wanting to reconnect with old friends, but the pattern suggests otherwise.\n\nI think the author's decision to leave is understandable given the repeated violations of trust and the fianc\u00e9's lack of commitment to the relationship. While snooping isn't ideal, the circumstances might justify it if there's a pattern of deceit. The fianc\u00e9's actions are the main issue here. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
