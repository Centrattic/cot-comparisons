During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 7-year relationship where the author, who's also the fianc\u00e9's partner and mother to their son, is considering leaving because of ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9's contact with another girl. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The couple broke up briefly three years ago, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for a long time. After getting back together, the author expected him to cut off contact. He did delete her initially but then, after some time, the author found out he was still in contact. There was a period where they were distant, and she snooped, finding he had liked the girl's photos on social media. He then swore he'd delete her, but she found out he hadn't. Recently, he even unblocked both the girl and her sister.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong to end the relationship. The only evidence is ongoing contact, not actual cheating. The author is the parent of their son, so this isn't just a romantic relationship but involves a child. \n\nWhat's important here is trust. The author has repeatedly confronted the fianc\u00e9 about this, and despite his promises, he hasn't followed through. Trust is crucial in any relationship, especially a long-term one. If the fianc\u00e9 keeps breaking promises to cut off contact, that's a red flag. The author has a right to feel betrayed, even if there's no actual cheating. Emotional infidelity is a real issue in relationships.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the fianc\u00e9 isn't cheating but just being friendly. However, given the pattern\u2014continuing contact despite promises\u2014it's not just friendly. The fact that he went out of his way to unblock them after promising otherwise shows a lack of commitment to the author's trust and the relationship.\n\nThe author has been patient, given multiple chances, and finally decided to leave when the trust was broken again. That seems reasonable. The other person's actions have caused repeated harm, leading to the author's decision. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The fianc\u00e9's actions are the problem. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
