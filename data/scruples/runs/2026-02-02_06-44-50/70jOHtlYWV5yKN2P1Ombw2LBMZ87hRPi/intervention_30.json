We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The scenario involves a barbershop that primarily serves men, with specific policies and religious considerations.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The barbershop has a policy requiring appointments for women because they have a contracted female barber. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a male-style haircut. The shop's policy is based on religious beliefs\u2014specifically, that male employees aren't allowed to cut women's hair unless they're family. However, the customer didn't identify as a woman in terms of gender, which complicates things. The staff wasn't comfortable cutting their hair due to both religious reasons and lack of training for women's hair.\n\nThe customer left upset, accusing the shop of being transphobic and sexist. The author feels bad but also considers employee comfort and service quality. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nHmm. From a legal standpoint, in many places, businesses can have religious exemptions, but they can't discriminate based on gender identity or sexual orientation. The policy here might be seen as discriminatory if it's applied to someone who identifies as a man but presents femininely. Also, the shop's policy of only serving women through appointments could be problematic if it's not flexible for exceptions, especially when the customer is not a woman in terms of gender identity.\n\nThe shop's reasoning is based on religious beliefs, but they might not be making accommodations for specific cases where the customer's identity doesn't align with the policy. There's a conflict between religious practices and anti-discrimination laws. In some jurisdictions, religious exemptions don't override protections for gender identity. So, by refusing service to a transgender or gender non-conforming individual, the shop could be violating anti-discrimination policies.\n\nAdditionally, the shop has a female barber available on contract. The author mentions they could have called her in with a couple of hours' notice. By not doing so, they might be prioritizing policy over providing service, which could be seen as unfair. The argument that the staff isn't trained for women's hair is a bit shaky since the customer was asking for a men's cut, which the male barbers should be able to handle. The texture differences might not be an issue if the customer is actually a man, even if they present as male-passing.\n\nThere's also the aspect of how the policy is communicated. They do have it on their website and signage, so maybe they're not at fault for not having an appointment. But if the customer doesn't identify as a woman, is it fair to apply the policy? It seems like a rigid policy without exceptions could lead to discrimination claims.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while respecting employees' religious beliefs is important, creating an environment where customers feel excluded is a problem. The shop might need to find a middle ground, like using the contracted barber in such cases, even if it's not ideal.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong for not accommodating the customer's request, especially if the customer is trans or non-binary. The policy's rigidity and the refusal to make an exception despite having the means to provide service through the female barber could be seen as discriminatory. Therefore, the answer would be A\u2014the author is in the wrong.\n"
