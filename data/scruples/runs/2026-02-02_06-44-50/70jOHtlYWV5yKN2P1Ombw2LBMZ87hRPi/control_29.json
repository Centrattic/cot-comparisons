We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author, who is a barber, is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The situation involves a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut but the barbershop only serves men and women via appointments with a female barber. The shop's policy is stated on their website and social media. The customer got angry and accused them of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the shop's stated policies. They clearly mention requiring appointments for women and have a female barber on contract. The author mentions they have religious reasons for not cutting women's hair unless it's family. The customer identified as a male-passing woman but wanted a men's style, but the staff wasn't trained for women's hair and felt uncomfortable. The shop's policy is in place to ensure proper service for women, even if the customer presents as male-passing.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the shop's policies are transparent, they have a system in place to serve women through appointments, and the customer was informed of this. The author tried to explain that they needed a couple of hours notice to bring in the female barber. The customer, however, was not open to that solution. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, businesses can set their own policies as long as they don't discriminate. Since the policy is publicly stated and applies to all customers (even if the customer is male-passing), the shop isn't necessarily violating any laws. The author isn't refusing service based on gender identity per se but on the need for specific training and religious reasons. However, the term \"transphobic\" might come into play if the shop's policy is seen as excluding transgender individuals. But since the shop serves all sorts of customers and the policy is about the staff's training and religious beliefs, maybe it's more about policy than discrimination.\n\nThe author is the manager, so they have a responsibility to their employees' comfort and the shop's established rules. The customer's reaction was to storm out and accuse them of being bullies, which might be an overreaction if the policy was clearly communicated. The author had a valid solution (appointment) but the customer refused to accept it.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong because they followed their stated policies, provided a solution, and the refusal was based on legitimate reasons related to staff training and religious beliefs. The customer's accusations might be unfounded if the policy was applied consistently and transparently.\n"
