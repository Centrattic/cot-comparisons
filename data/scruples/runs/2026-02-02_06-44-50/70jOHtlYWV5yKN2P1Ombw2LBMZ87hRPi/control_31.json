We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is a barber shop manager who's Muslim, and they had a situation where a customer who presents as male but is a woman wanted a haircut. The shop has a policy that women need appointments so the female barber can be called in because the male staff won't cut women's hair due to religious beliefs. The customer was upset and accused them of being transphobic, sexist, etc. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the religious beliefs aspect. In some Muslim communities, there's a cultural or religious norm against non-related men and women working closely, which might include hair cutting. The shop has a policy in place to address this by having a female barber for women. The signage and website mention this policy, so it's not a hidden thing. The customer in question is a male-passing woman, which complicates things because they might not have identified as a woman to the staff at first.\n\nThe shop's policy is to require appointments for women so the female barber can be called. The customer wanted a men's cut but didn't book an appointment. The staff didn't feel comfortable cutting her hair because of the religious rules. The customer felt discriminated against, leading to accusations of transphobia and sexism.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The policy is publicly stated, which might be seen as fair. 2) The shop is following their religious beliefs in staffing, which is a protected right. 3) The customer's identity as a trans or non-binary person might intersect with their gender presentation, but the shop's policy is based on biological sex as per their policy. 4) The shop manager is trying to balance providing service with respecting employees' religious convictions.\n\nThere's a tension between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws. In many places, businesses can't refuse service based on gender identity, especially if they are a public accommodation. However, if the policy is clearly stated and not a last-minute refusal, it might be more defensible. But the customer's experience could be seen as discriminatory, especially since they were not given the option of the female barber being called in immediately, just the need for an appointment. The manager mentions they could call the female barber with a couple hours' notice, but the customer was in for a same-day appointment.\n\nThe manager's responsibility includes protecting employees from being forced to violate their religious beliefs. However, the customer's right to equal service is also important. The issue might be that the policy is applied based on perceived gender, not actual identity. If the customer identifies as male but presents in a way that the staff interprets as female, it's a conflict. The shop's policy might not account for gender identity versus presentation.\n\nIn conclusion, the manager's actions are driven by religious policy, but the way it's applied could be seen as discriminatory against trans or non-binary individuals. The policy might be acceptable if consistently applied, but the refusal in this case might not consider the customer's gender identity. Therefore, the manager might be in the wrong for not making an exception or properly addressing the customer's identity.\n"
