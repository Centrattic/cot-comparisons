We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation. So the user is a barber shop manager who's Muslim, and their shop has a policy that they can't cut women's hair because of religious reasons. They mentioned that they have a female barber on contract for women. The situation involves a customer who is a male-passing woman wanting a man's style haircut. The shop's policy requires appointments for women, and since the staff wasn't trained to handle women's hair, they couldn't accommodate her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender or gender identity. Even if it's a religious exemption, there might be laws that override that. For example, in the US, the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination in public accommodations. So if a business is open to the public, they can't refuse service based on gender, even if it's for religious reasons.\n\nThen there's the question of the customer's identity. If the person is a male-passing woman but wants a men's cut, does that change things? The shop's policy is based on the customer's gender, but if the customer identifies as a woman, they might still be within their rights to request the service. The shop's policy might be seen as discriminatory against transgender individuals or non-binary people.\n\nAlso, the shop's policy of requiring appointments for women because of religious reasons could be considered discriminatory. Even if they have a female barber available, the refusal to serve women without appointments could be a barrier. The customer was told they needed an appointment, but since the female barber isn't always available, it's not a guaranteed solution. The shop might not be providing equal service to all genders, which could be problematic.\n\nThe staff's comfort level is another angle. The employees aren't trained to cut women's hair due to religious beliefs. But that doesn't necessarily justify discrimination. Maybe the shop could have provided training or adjusted their policies to accommodate different needs. However, the user mentioned that training isn't done because of religious reasons, which complicates things but doesn't necessarily make it acceptable under anti-discrimination laws.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the customer being labeled as transphobic or sexist. The user's intention might not be to discriminate, but the policy's effect is that they can't serve certain customers. The problem is that the policy disproportionately affects women and possibly transgender individuals, which could be seen as discriminatory regardless of intent.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, businesses must make reasonable accommodations for people's gender identity. Refusing service based on gender, even if the person is male-passing, could be an issue. The shop might need to revisit their policies to ensure they comply with local laws and are inclusive.\n\nSo putting it all together, the user's shop is likely in the wrong because their policy leads to discrimination against certain customers, which is illegal in many places. The religious exemption might not hold up in a legal context, especially when it comes to public accommodations. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
