We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're a barber shop manager, mostly serving men, with a policy requiring appointments for women so a female barber can handle them. A customer who is a male-passing woman came in wanting a men's cut, but the staff wasn't comfortable because of religious reasons. The customer felt it was transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, the author mentions their policy is stated clearly on their website and social media. So maybe the customer wasn't aware? But the person was a male-passing woman, so maybe they didn't realize the shop had a policy for women. The shop's policy is based on religious beliefs\u2014specifically, not allowing male staff to cut women's hair unless family. But the customer identifies as a woman but presents as male, so maybe they wanted a cut typically for men. The author points out that their staff isn't trained in women's hair, but in this case, the customer is seeking a men's style, so maybe that's a conflict. Also, the author says they could have called in the female barber if given a couple hours notice, but the customer didn't want to wait or hear that. \n\nThe customer accused them of being transphobic and sexist. The author might be in the wrong if they are denying service based on gender identity. Even if the policy is clear, if the customer identifies as a woman but presents as male, the policy might not account for that. Also, the staff's religious beliefs shouldn't override the customer's right to service, especially if the customer is transgender or non-binary. The shop's policy might be discriminatory, even if it's based on religious exemptions. The employees' comfort shouldn't be the priority over the customer's right to service. Plus, the author mentions that the female barber is on an appointment basis, but maybe they should adjust their policy to be more inclusive. So, the author might be in the wrong by not accommodating the customer despite the policy and the customer's identity.\n"
