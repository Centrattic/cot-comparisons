We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the barbershop manager (the author) is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The situation involves a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut, but the shop's policy requires appointments for women because they don't train staff in women's hair due to religious reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The shop has a policy that requires appointments for women because the staff isn't trained to cut women's hair, partly due to Islamic religious beliefs. They have a female stylist available on appointment. The customer identified as male-passing female, wanted a men's cut, but the staff wasn't comfortable. The customer felt discriminated against, called them transphobic, etc., and left angry.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or sexual orientation. If the customer is a woman (even if she presents as male), the refusal could be seen as gender discrimination. The shop's policy might not hold up if the customer is transgender or non-binary, as they are entitled to equal service. The shop's reasoning is based on religious beliefs, but that might not exempt them from anti-discrimination laws. Some places allow religious exemptions, but others don't, especially when it's a public accommodation.\n\nEthically, the situation is complex. The shop's religious practices are valid, but so is the customer's right to be served. The shop's policy might be inclusive for most women by having the female barber, but if the customer is transgender, the policy might exclude them. The manager might not have considered the nuances of gender identity here. The staff's discomfort could be due to both religious reasons and lack of training, but if the shop serves all customers regardless of gender, they should be trained accordingly.\n\nThe customer's reaction is understandable if they felt their identity was being disregarded. They might have expected to be treated as a man, hence a standard haircut. The manager's insistence on the policy without accommodation could come off as inflexible. The manager mentions being able to call in the female barber with a couple of hours' notice, which would solve the problem, but the customer didn't want to wait or perhaps didn't agree. The manager's stance of prioritizing employee comfort over customer needs could be seen as problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, while the shop has religious reasons for the policy, the refusal to serve a customer based on gender identity without a valid, legal exception might make the manager at fault. The key factors are whether the shop's policy violates anti-discrimination laws and if there's a way to accommodate the customer without compromising the staff's beliefs. If the shop can't adjust their policy to include transgender customers, they might be in the wrong. So, the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
