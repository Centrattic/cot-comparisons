We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the user is the manager of a barbershop that's mostly serving men. They have a policy that requires appointments for women, because they only have one female barber who's contracted as needed. The situation is about a customer who identifies as male-passing but is a woman. The customer wanted a haircut, but since the shop doesn't have female barbers on staff, except for the contracted one, the customer was told they needed an appointment. The customer got upset and accused the shop of being transphobic, sexist, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the shop's policy. They state publicly that they're mostly for men and require appointments for women. That's clear. The reason given is both religious (not allowing male barbers to cut women's hair due to Islamic norms) and practical (different tools, training). But the customer here is a woman who presents as male, so maybe they felt they should be treated as a male customer. The shop's response was that their policy is based on the gender of the customer, not their gender identity, which complicates things.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author (the manager) is in the wrong. Legally, in many places, discrimination based on gender identity is prohibited. Even if the shop has a religious exemption, there might be a conflict between religious practices and anti-discrimination laws. The customer might argue that being denied service because they are a woman (even if they pass as male) is discriminatory. However, the shop might claim they have a religious right to set their policies. \n\nEthically, it's tricky. The shop isn't refusing service to women in general\u2014they have a system in place to accommodate them when possible. But in this case, the customer wasn't given the option to wait for the female barber, except to book an appointment. The shop also mentions employee comfort and training as issues. However, the customer might feel that their gender identity is being ignored, and that the shop is not making reasonable accommodations. \n\nAnother angle: The shop's policy is based on the customer's gender as perceived by the shop, not the customer's own identity. If the customer identifies as male, but the shop doesn't accept that, they might be enforcing a policy that doesn't consider gender identity. That could be seen as transphobic. However, if the shop's policy is strictly for biological sex, then the customer's situation is a gray area.\n\nLegally, in the US, for example, some states have non-discrimination laws that include gender identity. If the shop is in such a state, they might be violating the law. The manager's defense is that they have a contracted female barber, but the policy requires appointments, which could be seen as a loophole. However, the customer might argue that they should be allowed to get a haircut without an appointment if they identify as male. \n\nAlso, the shop's policy might be seen as discriminatory if they don't make exceptions for gender non-conforming individuals. The manager's insistence on the appointment system could be problematic if it effectively denies service to people who don't fit the binary approach the shop uses.\n\nIn terms of ethics, balancing religious freedom against anti-discrimination laws is a common debate. The shop has their religious practices, but if those practices lead to discrimination, there's a conflict. The manager might not be in the wrong in their own eyes, but legally or socially, it could be seen as wrong.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because their policy may not accommodate gender identity and could be discriminatory, even if they have a system in place for women. The customer's experience suggests that the shop's policy didn't consider their identity, leading to a conflict. However, there's also the argument about religious practices. But in many jurisdictions, anti-discrimination laws override religious exemptions in public accommodations.\n"
