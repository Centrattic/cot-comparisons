We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the manager of a barbershop, who didn't cut a customer's hair because they identified as a male-passing woman but the shop only allows women to be cut by the contracted female barber, is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the shop's policy is clear: they primarily serve men, and women need appointments because the staff, being mostly Muslim, isn't comfortable cutting women's hair unless it's family. They have a female barber on contract for women. The customer here is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's style cut, so they argued that the appointment system shouldn't apply. The manager refused because the policy is in place to ensure women get proper service, considering different tools and products, and that the staff wasn't trained for women's hair. The customer got upset, called them transphobic, etc.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are gender identity and the shop's policy based on religious beliefs. The customer identifies as a woman but presents as male, so they might not fit the shop's criteria for requiring a female barber. The shop's reasoning is that women's hair requires different handling, which might not apply if the customer is presenting as male. The manager's stance is that they can't deviate from the policy for non-appointments, even if the customer is a woman but wants a men's cut. But maybe the policy was meant for customers who are women in terms of gender identity or presentation?\n\nWait, the shop's policy is about the customer's gender, not their gender identity. If the customer is male-passing but identifies as a woman, they might be considered a man by the shop's standards, thus requiring the male barber. But the shop's policy is to require appointments for \"women,\" so this customer might not qualify. However, the customer is a woman in terms of gender identity, which complicates things. \n\nThe shop's reasoning about different hair textures and tools might not apply if the customer is presenting as male and wants a men's cut. So the manager's refusal might be based on a policy that doesn't account for the customer's gender identity. The customer felt discriminated against because they were denied service based on their gender presentation, even though they identify as a woman.\n\nAlso, the shop's policy is stated on their website and signage, so the customer might have expected that. But if the customer is male-passing, maybe the shop didn't realize they were a woman when making the decision. The manager had to consider the employees' comfort and religious beliefs, but there's also a potential issue of transphobia or sexism if the policy doesn't adapt to gender identity.\n\nIn terms of legality, some places have anti-discrimination laws based on gender identity. If the shop is refusing service to a transgender or gender non-conforming person, that could be illegal. The manager might be in the wrong if the policy doesn't account for such cases. Also, the customer's argument is that they are a woman, so the shop's policy should apply, but the manager refused because they didn't have an appointment, even though the customer wasn't booked as a woman in their system.\n\nSo, on one hand, the shop has their policy based on religious beliefs and employee comfort. On the other, the customer's gender identity might require accommodation under anti-discrimination laws. The manager might be in the wrong if the policy excludes transgender or non-binary individuals, even if they present as male. The key is whether the policy is based on the customer's gender identity versus their presentation. If the customer is a woman (trans) but presenting as male, the shop's policy should still require them to book with the female barber if applicable, but the manager refused because they didn't have an appointment. However, the shop's policy might not be flexible enough to handle such cases, leading to discrimination.\n\nGiven all that, the manager might be in the wrong (A) because the policy doesn't account for the customer's gender identity, leading to transphobia and discrimination. The shop's refusal to make an exception, even though the customer could have been served by the contracted female barber if given notice, shows a lack of accommodation. The manager's reasoning about employees' comfort and religious beliefs might not override legal or ethical obligations to serve all customers, including trans individuals.\n"
