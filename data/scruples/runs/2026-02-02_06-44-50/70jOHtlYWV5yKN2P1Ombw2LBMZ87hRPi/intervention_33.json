We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a barber who's a manager at a shop that mainly serves men but has a policy where women need appointments because they only have one female barber who's contracted. The customer in question was a male-passing woman who wanted a man's style haircut. They refused to book an appointment, and the shop couldn't cut their hair because the staff isn't trained in women's haircuts due to religious reasons. The customer accused them of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the shop's policy. They clearly state that appointments are required for women, which is known on their website, Facebook, etc. The reason given is that they only have one female barber who's contracted, and the male staff aren't trained in women's haircuts because of religious beliefs. The author mentions that they serve all sorts of customers but have this specific policy for women. The customer here identified as a male-passing woman but wanted a men's haircut. The shop couldn't accommodate because the policy is based on gender, not gender identity.\n\nNow, the customer might have felt that since they're presenting as male and want a men's cut, the policy shouldn't apply. However, the shop's policy is based on biological sex because of the religious reasons provided. So, the shop is applying the policy consistently. The problem here is whether that policy is discriminatory. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, businesses can have policies based on gender, but they might need to be careful if it's seen as discriminatory. However, if the policy is based on the employees' religious beliefs and they can't train male staff to cut women's hair due to those beliefs, then there's a religious accommodation aspect. But if the customer is transgender and their identity is male, the shop's policy might not account for that. However, the customer in this case is male-passing but still female biologically, so the shop's policy applies to their biology, not their gender identity. \n\nThe key points are: the shop's policy is clear, the customer didn't follow the appointment system, and the refusal was based on the shop's stated policy. The customer might feel transphobic if the policy doesn't consider their gender identity, but the shop is following the policy based on biological sex as per their religious training. \n\nHowever, the shop is not allowing the customer to be served because they don't have a female employee available at that time and the male staff can't do it. The customer might argue that the shop is denying service based on gender and not providing an alternative. The shop claims they need a couple of hours notice to bring in the female barber, but the customer didn't want to book an appointment. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the shop is prioritizing their employees' religious comfort and the policy they've set. The customer is being denied service, which could be seen as discriminatory. But the shop is also trying to follow their own rules and the customers' beliefs. It's a tough spot. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the policy is based on biological sex and the customer is a female-bodied person, then the shop is enforcing their policy. However, if the customer identifies as male and is being denied service based on their gender identity, that could be a problem. The answer might depend on whether the policy is based on gender identity or biological sex. The shop's policy seems to be based on biological sex because of the religious reasons. So, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if the policy is considered discriminatory against transgender individuals, then they could be. \n\nBut the customer here is male-passing and wants a men's haircut. If the shop's policy is written to exclude anyone based on gender identity, that's different. But if they use a cisgender-based policy, then they might be okay. It's a bit confusing. The author might not be in the wrong because they followed their policy, but there's a risk of discrimination claims. Alternatively, the shop could adjust their policy to be more inclusive. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the policy is based on gender identity or biological sex. Since the shop's policy is based on biological sex due to religious training, they might not be in the wrong. However, in some jurisdictions, this could still be considered discriminatory. The author's answer might depend on local laws and cultural context. But the question is more about whether they are in the wrong ethically or morally. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong because they followed their stated policy and considered their employees' religious beliefs. However, the customer's reaction might indicate that the policy could be seen as transphobic if it doesn't account for gender identity. But since the customer is female-bodied and the policy applies to biological sex, the shop is enforcing it correctly. So, the answer is B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
