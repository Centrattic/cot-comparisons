We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a barber shop managed by a Muslim person. They have a policy where women need appointments because they have a contracted female barber. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut. The shop's policy is based on religious beliefs where male employees can't cut women's hair unless it's family. The customer was upset, called them transphobic, etc., and left.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the religious policy and the customer's identity. The shop states their policy clearly on their website and signage, so the customer should have known beforehand. But the customer identified as a male-passing woman, so maybe the shop didn't realize they were serving a woman. However, the customer was clear about wanting a men's cut, but the policy requires appointments for women. The issue is whether the shop's refusal was justified.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. Even if the policy is based on religion, there might be laws against denying services to transgender or gender non-conforming individuals. The shop's policy might be seen as excluding trans men or non-binary people who present as male but are legally or self-identify as women. \n\nAlso, the shop's stated reason is about religious accommodation, but if they can make exceptions (like the contracted female barber), maybe they should be more flexible. The customer didn't want a woman's cut but a man's, which might make the situation more about gender identity rather than the hair texture. However, the shop insists on the appointment system for women, regardless of the customer's request. \n\nThe employees' discomfort is mentioned, but if the business is in a place where they must serve all customers regardless of gender identity, then the employees' refusal might not be valid. However, the manager is balancing employee comfort and legal obligations. \n\nBut from a social justice perspective, denying service based on perceived gender or identity could be problematic. The customer was male-passing, so maybe the shop didn't realize they were a woman, but by the time they found out, it was too late. However, the shop's policy is clear, but the customer might feel it's discriminatory. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the religious policy overrides anti-discrimination laws and common decency. If the law requires equal service regardless of gender identity, then the author is in the wrong. If the religious exemption allows it, then maybe not. But in many jurisdictions, businesses can't use religion to discriminate. Hence, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
