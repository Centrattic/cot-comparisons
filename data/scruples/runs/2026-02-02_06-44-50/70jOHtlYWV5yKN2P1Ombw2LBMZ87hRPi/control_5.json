We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author, who is a barber and manager, is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's style haircut, but the shop has a policy requiring appointments for women because they don't typically serve women and their staff isn't trained for that due to religious reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender or gender identity. If the customer is a woman who wants a men's cut, but the shop has a policy that doesn't allow them to serve her without an appointment because they don't have female staff, that might be a form of discrimination. Even if the reason is religious, there are laws against refusing service based on gender or transgender status. For example, in the US, some states have laws under civil rights that protect against discrimination in public accommodations.\n\nThen there's the policy aspect. The shop states on their website and signage that they serve mostly men and have a female stylist on appointment basis. If the customer comes in thinking they can get a men's cut but the shop can't serve them because of their gender, even though they present as male, that's a problem. The policy might be clear, but the customer might not realize they're considered a \"woman\" under the shop's policy. This could lead to a bad experience, especially if the customer didn't know they needed an appointment.\n\nFrom a business ethics perspective, the shop is prioritizing the comfort of their staff and their religious beliefs over serving a customer who is otherwise eligible. However, forcing a customer to book an appointment when they might not identify with the female category complicates things. The customer might feel they are being misgendered or excluded based on their gender identity.\n\nThe shop's stance is that they can't cut women's hair except for family, which is a religious practice. But if the customer is a woman (biologically or by identity), the shop isn't able to serve them unless the female stylist is available. However, the customer in question might identify as non-binary or transgender, adding another layer. The shop might be violating anti-discrimination laws by not serving them based on gender identity.\n\nAlso, the shop's argument about needing different products and tools isn't a solid legal defense. They could provide the same service if they had the proper training, which they choose not to do due to religious reasons. That could still be considered a barrier to service.\n\nIn summary, while the shop's policy is clear, the application might be discriminatory. The key points are whether the shop is legally allowed to refuse service based on gender identity and whether their policy is communicated effectively. If they can't serve someone who clearly fits their stated customer base (men) but are refusing due to the customer's gender identity, that's problematic. The answer might hinge on legal protections against discrimination in public accommodations.\n"
