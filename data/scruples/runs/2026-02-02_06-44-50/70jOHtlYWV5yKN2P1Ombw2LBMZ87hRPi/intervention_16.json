We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a manager at a barbershop/salon run by Muslim employees, mostly serving men. They have a policy requiring appointments for women because of religious reasons\u2014they don't cut women's hair unless it's family. The woman in question identified as male-passing and wanted a typical men's cut. The staff didn't feel comfortable cutting her hair because of the religious rules and possible differences in hair texture. The customer felt it was transphobic, sexist, etc., and left angry.\n\nSo, the key points here are the religious policy, the customer's gender identity, and the policy's application. The barbershop has a stated policy that women need appointments because they contract a female barber. But this customer is a woman who might pass as a man and wanted a men's cut. The staff didn't want to cut her hair either due to religious beliefs or discomfort with women's hair.\n\nFirst, the religious aspect is important. In some interpretations of Islam, men are not supposed to touch the hair of non-mahram women (women who are not close relatives). So the barbershop's policy is based on that belief. However, the customer in question is a woman, so according to the policy, they should require an appointment to get the female barber. But the customer didn't make an appointment and insisted that since they wanted a men's cut, it should be okay. The staff refused, leading to the conflict.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the business has a policy based on their religious beliefs, which they are entitled to under the First Amendment in the US. They can't be forced to violate their religious tenets. On the other hand, the customer might feel discriminated against, especially if they identify as transgender. If the customer is a trans man, they might be seen as a male in their identity, so the policy could be perceived as transphobic. But the business's policy is based on the customer's biological sex, not gender identity, which complicates things.\n\nThe staff isn't trained in women's haircuts due to the religious policy, which affects the service quality. The author argues that they need to protect their employees' beliefs and ensure proper service. However, the customer might not have known about the appointment policy for women, or they might have felt it was discriminatory regardless of the reason.\n\nIn terms of legal perspective, in some places, businesses can have religious exemptions, but in others, anti-discrimination laws might apply. However, the user is asking from an ethical standpoint, not legal. Ethically, the business is following its stated policies and religious beliefs, but the customer feels wronged. The author's responsibility is to uphold the business's values while also considering inclusivity. The answer might hinge on whether the policy is applied consistently and communicated clearly. Since the policy is stated on their website and signage, the customer might have been aware, but the incident still caused harm. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be in the wrong because they followed their established policy and the customer's refusal to comply led to the conflict. However, there's a valid argument that the policy could inadvertently discriminate against transgender individuals. But given the context and the business's stated policies, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
