We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a barber who didn't cut a customer's hair because the customer was a male-passing woman. The barbershop has a policy of requiring appointments for women, which is stated on their signs and online. The reason given is that they don't train in women's hair due to religious reasons, and they don't want their male barbers to touch women's hair. The customer was upset, called them transphobic, etc., and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The business is primarily Muslim, and there's a religious policy in place. They have a female barber available by appointment. So, the policy is in place to accommodate women, but in this case, the customer identifies as a male-passing woman. The question is whether the policy applies here. Since the customer is genderfluid or transgender, expecting a male barber to cut their hair even though they identify as a woman might be an issue. The business's policy is based on the customer's gender, not their gender identity. But the customer's gender identity doesn't align with the business's policy, which is based on the customer's assigned gender at birth or how they present.\n\nBut wait, the business's policy is based on the customer's gender as perceived. The customer is male-passing but identifies as a woman. If the business's policy is to require appointments for women, then they might not be considering gender identity. This could be a problem because the customer is being denied service based on their gender expression, not their gender identity. The business might be enforcing a policy that discriminates against transgender or gender-nonconforming individuals. \n\nAdditionally, the business claims not to train in women's hair due to religion, but that's a bit of a loophole. If they can provide a female barber for women by appointment, then maybe they could have provided that same service for a transgender woman. However, the customer wanted a man's cut, so maybe they didn't need the female barber's services. But if the staff is uncomfortable cutting a transgender woman's hair because they perceive it as a woman, that's transphobic. The business's policy is based on the customer's gender as per their appearance, not their identity. \n\nAlso, the business is Muslim, so maybe there's a religious justification for not having male barbers touch women's hair. But if a transgender man is cutting hair, that's different than a transgender woman. The religious rules might not account for gender identity. So, in this case, the business is applying the policy based on the customer's appearance, not their identity, which could be discriminatory. \n\nThe customer was told they needed an appointment, but since they are male-passing, they were denied. The business might have a policy in place that's not inclusive of transgender individuals. The employee's discomfort could be due to transphobia or misunderstanding. The business's policy is problematic because it's not accommodating based on identity. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they enforced a policy that discriminates against transgender or gender-nonconforming individuals. They should adjust their policy to consider gender identity rather than appearance. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
