We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a barber shop, run by Muslim employees, had a customer who was a male-passing woman. The shop has a policy that requires appointments for women because they don't have female staff trained to cut women's hair due to religious reasons. The customer wanted a men's style cut but was denied because they were considered a woman under the shop's policy. They left angry, accusing the shop of being transphobic and sexist. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies the shop has in place. They mentioned that they have a female stylist on contract for women. The signage and online presence state this policy. So, from the shop's perspective, they're being transparent. Their reasoning is based on both religious beliefs (not touching women's hair unless it's family) and practical differences in hair texture and tools. The employees aren't trained for women's hair, so they can't provide the service without the contracted stylist.\n\nNow, the customer in question is a male-passing woman. The key issue here is gender identity versus the shop's policy based on perceived gender. The shop's policy is tied to biological sex because of their religious reasons. But if the customer identifies as male but is perceived as female, does that conflict with the policy? The shop might not have a way to discern the customer's legal gender or identity, so they applied their standard policy. However, the customer felt discriminated against.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. Even if the policy is based on religious beliefs, some jurisdictions might require accommodations for transgender or gender non-conforming individuals. The shop might be violating anti-discrimination laws by denying service based on perceived gender without considering the individual's identity.\n\nEthically, the shop's policy could be seen as excluding transgender men or non-binary individuals who are perceived as women. Even if the policy is transparent, it might not account for individual cases where someone's gender identity doesn't align with their biological sex. The shop's reasoning about training and religious practices might not override the need to provide equal service to all customers, especially if the customer is within their legal rights.\n\nThe author's side is that they had to protect their employees' religious beliefs and the quality of service. However, the customer's experience of being transphobic or sexist suggests that the policy might not be inclusive enough. The author might not be in the wrong if the policy is legally compliant, but if the policy discriminates based on gender identity, then they could be in the wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer depends on the legal context and whether the shop's policy infringes on the customer's rights. If the shop's policy is based on biological sex and the customer is a transgender man, the shop might be violating anti-discrimination laws, making the author at fault. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
