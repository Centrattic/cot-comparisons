We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is a barber and manager at a shop that's mostly Muslim. They have a policy stating that women's haircuts require appointments because they only have one female barber who's on contract. The situation is about a customer who is a male-passing woman who wanted a haircut but didn't have an appointment. The shop's policy is to require appointments for women due to religious reasons\u2014specifically, the staff isn't allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family. The author didn't cut her hair because of the policy, and the customer became upset, calling them transphobic, etc.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks yes, but I need to evaluate.\n\nFirst, consider the policy. The shop clearly states their policy on their website, signs, etc. That transparency is important. If someone visits, they should read the policies, but maybe not everyone does. The customer in question might not have realized the policy applies to them as a woman. But the customer identifies as a male-passing woman. So, they might feel that their identity is male, hence expecting a male barber. However, the shop's policy is based on the customer's gender as perceived by the shop's standards. If the shop's policy is based on biological sex (as some religious rulings might consider), then they might not make an exception based on gender identity.\n\nNext, the shop's religious beliefs are a factor. The employees are adhering to their faith's teachings, which prohibit them from cutting women's hair unless it's family. The shop's policy is in place to comply with these beliefs, which is a protected right in many places. However, there's a conflict here between religious freedom and potential discrimination based on gender identity or expression.\n\nThe shop manager is trying to protect their employees' rights to not cut women's hair, which is part of their religious practice. However, the customer felt discriminated against. If the shop's policy is based on biological sex, then the customer, being a trans man who is not transitioning, might be considered a woman biologically. If the shop's policy is based on gender identity, then perhaps they could have accommodated. But the shop's policy is clear: appointments for women. The customer might not have considered that their gender identity doesn't override the policy's requirement for appointments.\n\nAlso, the shop manager tried to explain that they needed a couple hours' notice to call in the female barber. The customer didn't listen, so the manager had to enforce the policy. The manager might argue that the policy is in place to serve women, not to exclude them, but it's a conflict of rights.\n\nIn terms of legal perspective, some places have laws that protect against discrimination based on gender identity or expression, which might require the shop to accommodate. However, religious exemptions can sometimes protect businesses from such laws. But it's a complex area. The manager might not be in the wrong if the policy is applied consistently and is based on religious beliefs, but there's a strong argument that the customer was discriminated against based on their gender identity.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to weigh these factors. The key points are: clear policy, religious freedom, potential discrimination against a trans person. If the shop's policy is based on biological sex, and the customer is a trans man, then the shop is not providing service based on that. But if the customer identifies as male, the shop's policy might not consider that. However, the shop's policy is about the employee's comfort due to religious beliefs. There's a balance between the employees' rights and the customer's rights. The manager had the right female barber available but needed notice. The customer didn't want to wait or make an appointment. The manager is in a tough spot, but maybe the policy is too rigid and could be adjusted to accommodate gender identity. The answer might depend on local laws and whether the shop's policy is considered discriminatory. Given that the customer was male-passing and might not have been identified as a woman by others, the shop's policy could be seen as not accommodating. So, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
