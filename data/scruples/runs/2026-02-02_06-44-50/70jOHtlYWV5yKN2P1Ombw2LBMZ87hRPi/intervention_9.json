We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair because the customer was a male-passing woman, and the barbershop has a policy that requires appointments for women. The shop is primarily Muslim, and they don't train staff to cut women's hair due to religious reasons. They mention having a female stylist who can be called in with an appointment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The shop states upfront that they require appointments for women, which is part of their policy. The customer, who identifies as male-passing but is a woman, wanted a men's cut but didn't have an appointment. The staff wasn't comfortable cutting her hair due to religious beliefs and lack of training. The customer accused them of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nNow, the author is the manager and had to make the call. The question is whether they were wrong not to provide the service. From a business perspective, they have a policy that's publicly communicated. If the customer didn't follow the appointment process, the shop isn't obligated to serve them outside their stated policies. However, the customer's identity as a male-passing woman complicates things. If they were seen as male, perhaps the initial policy might not apply, but the shop's policy is based on gender, which could be a point of contention.\n\nLegally, in many places, businesses can have certain policies, but there are laws against discrimination based on gender identity, gender expression, or other protected classes. If the policy excludes transgender or gender non-conforming individuals, it could be problematic. The shop's policy is based on the customer's assigned sex at birth (women), but if the customer is presenting as male (even if they are technically a woman), the policy might not have been enforced consistently. However, if the shop considers the customer as female regardless of their presentation, then the policy would apply. This could be a case of the customer not being aware of the policy, but the shop did advertise it.\n\nReligious exemptions are sometimes allowed, but they don't always override anti-discrimination laws. The shop's religious beliefs might allow them to refuse service based on gender, but if the customer is transgender or gender non-conforming, that's a different issue. However, in this case, the customer is a cisgender woman presenting as male, which might not fall under protected categories in some jurisdictions. Wait, no\u2014gender identity and expression are protected in many places, and even cisgender people who don't conform to traditional gender norms should be protected from discrimination.\n\nAnother angle: the shop's policy might be discriminatory. If they require appointments for women but don't for men, and a woman is presenting as male but gets denied because the shop assumes she's a woman, that's a problem. The shop's policy is based on gender, which could be seen as discriminatory regardless of the reasons. Plus, the shop is using religion as a basis for their policy, which doesn't necessarily exempt them from anti-discrimination laws.\n\nThe argument that they don't train staff to cut women's hair due to religion might be a business policy but could still be discriminatory. The fact that they have a female stylist available with an appointment suggests they can accommodate women if given notice. The customer might not have realized the policy's strictness or might have thought that presenting as male would allow them to get a service without an appointment.\n\nSo, the shop's policy is clear, but enforcing it in a way that denies service to a customer who doesn't conform to their gender expectations (whether cisgender or transgender) could be considered discriminatory. The author's refusal might be based on the shop's stated policies, but those policies may not align with anti-discrimination laws. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for enforcing a policy that discriminates against women, even if it's based on religious beliefs. The fact that they were told they're transphobic and sexist might not be entirely accurate if the customer is a cisgender woman, but the policy itself is discriminatory regardless of the customer's gender identity.\n\nIn conclusion, while the shop has a policy, enforcing it in this way could be seen as discriminatory, making the author at fault. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
