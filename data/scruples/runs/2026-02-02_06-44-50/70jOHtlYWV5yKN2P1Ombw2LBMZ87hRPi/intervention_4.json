We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber shop manager who primarily serves men but has a policy requiring appointments for women. They have one contracted female barber. A non-binary customer who presents as male wanted a men's haircut but since they're not a man, the shop couldn't offer the service because of their religious policy. The customer got upset and accused them of being transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the policy is discriminatory. The shop states their policy publicly, so the customer might not have known. The main issue here seems to be the shop's refusal to provide service based on gender. But the customer identifies as non-binary, so their presentation as male might not align with their gender identity. The shop's policy is rooted in religious beliefs, specifically about male employees not touching women's hair. However, the customer is a cross-dressing woman, which complicates things because the shop's policy is about gender of the client, not gender identity.\n\nThe shop's reasoning includes the need for different tools and training for women's hair, which is a practical point. However, the customer's claim is that they wanted a men's cut, so maybe they expected to be treated as male. The shop couldn't do that because the customer is a woman, according to their appearance, leading to a conflict. The shop's policy is clear, but the customer didn't book an appointment, so maybe the shop isn't in the wrong for following their own rules. But the problem is whether the policy is discriminatory. The shop's policy is based on the customer's physical presentation (gender), not their identity. That could be seen as transphobic if the customer is non-binary and the shop is using appearance over identity. Also, the policy is about appointments, not the customer's gender identity. However, by using appearance to determine service, they might be violating anti-discrimination laws, which often protect gender identity. So even if the policy is religious, it might not be a valid defense if it disproportionately affects transgender or non-binary individuals. The shop could argue it's about religious accommodation, but the customer argues it's bias. It's a tricky balance between religious freedom and anti-discrimination. Depending on the jurisdiction, the shop might be in the wrong for refusing service based on appearance without considering identity. The employees' discomfort is also a factor, but the business has a responsibility to accommodate diverse needs within legal boundaries. So, the answer might lean towards the shop being in the wrong (A) because their policy, while stated, could be discriminatory based on gender identity, which is protected in many places. Alternatively, if the policy is about the tools and training needed for women's hair, maybe they could argue it's a business necessity. But since the customer is a woman (based on appearance) and the shop requires appointments for women, the refusal isn't about the customer's identity but their gender. If the customer is non-binary and wants services as a man, the shop's policy is using appearance over identity, which could be problematic. So, the shop might be in the wrong for not accommodating the customer's self-identification. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
