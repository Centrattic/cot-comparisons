We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is a barber shop that's mostly for men, with one female barber available by appointment. The shop is run primarily by Muslims, and there's a religious policy that male barbers can't cut women's hair unless it's a family member. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a haircut without an appointment. The shop's policy is that women need appointments to ensure the female barber is available. The customer got upset and accused them of being transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies mentioned. The shop clearly states on their website, Facebook, and signage that appointments are required for women. So the customer should have been aware of that. The author, as the manager, probably followed the policy. The issue is whether refusing the customer based on their gender identity is discriminatory.\n\nThe customer identifies as male-passing but is a woman. The shop's policy is based on biological sex because of the religious requirement. But the customer might feel that their gender identity should be respected here. The problem is that the shop's policy doesn't accommodate gender identity, which could be seen as transphobic. \n\nThe shop's reasoning is that they can't cut women's hair due to religious beliefs and that they don't train for women's hair, which is different. But by not making an exception for a trans person who is male-passing, they might be excluding someone who doesn't fit the traditional gender lines. \n\nThere's a conflict between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws. In some places, businesses can claim religious exemptions, but others require equal service regardless of gender identity. The shop's policy might be legal if it's based on religious practices, but it could also be considered discriminatory if it's excluding people based on gender identity. \n\nThe author didn't cut the hair because they needed to schedule the female barber, which would take a couple of hours. The customer was upset because they didn't want to wait. The author's side is that they have to follow the policy for employees' comfort and service quality. However, the customer felt targeted because they are trans. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, gender identity is protected under anti-discrimination laws. So the shop might be violating those laws by refusing service based on the customer's gender identity, even if they identify as male-passing. The policy based on biological sex might not account for transgender individuals. \n\nOn the other hand, the shop has a legitimate religious reason for their policy. But if the policy is applied in a way that discriminates against someone's gender identity, that's where the conflict arises. The question is whether the author is wrong for enforcing a policy that inadvertently discriminates against a trans person. \n\nConsidering all that, the author might be in the wrong because the policy doesn't accommodate the customer's gender identity, even if they are male-passing. The shop could be seen as transphobic by not making an exception or adjusting the policy to be inclusive. The fact that the customer was told to make an appointment but couldn't due to the same policy might also be an issue. The answer could lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the policy might be discriminatory towards transgender individuals.\n"
