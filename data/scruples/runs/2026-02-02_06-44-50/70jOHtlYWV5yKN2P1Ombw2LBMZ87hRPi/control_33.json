We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a barber who didn't cut a male-passing woman's hair because they have a policy requiring appointments for women due to religious reasons and not training in women's hair. The customer felt discriminated against, called them transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The barbershop has a policy requiring appointments for women, which is communicated on their website and social media. They have a female barber they can contract. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut but didn't have an appointment. The staff didn't feel comfortable cutting her hair due to religious beliefs and lack of training.\n\nNow, considering legal aspects: In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. If they serve men and they're denying service to someone who presents as male, that might be a problem. But if their policy is about gender assigned at birth, that's different. However, the policy is based on sex (women need appointments), but the customer is a woman who presents as male. So maybe the policy is based on biological sex, but the customer is challenging that.\n\nReligious exemptions are a tricky area. Some places allow businesses to cite religious beliefs to deny services, but others don't, especially in public accommodations. The barbershop's policy is stated upfront, so maybe they can say they're clear about their services. However, if the policy is based on the customer's sex assigned at birth, and the customer is a woman who doesn't present as such, it's a conflict.\n\nAlso, the staff not being trained for women's hair: that's a business policy, but if they have a female barber they can call, maybe they could adjust. The customer wanted a men's cut, so maybe the staff's discomfort is based on the customer's sex, not the cut's style.\n\nFrom the customer's perspective, they might see this as discrimination based on gender identity. If they present as male and are denied service for women's appointments, they might feel it's transphobic. The staff's refusal could be seen as not accommodating gender identity.\n\nThe barbershop's stance is about religious beliefs and business policies, but if they can provide the service (by calling in the female barber) with a bit of notice, then the denial seems unnecessary. The customer wasn't willing to wait, but the staff could have arranged it. The problem is that the staff felt uncomfortable, but if the business has a way to provide the service, then the policy might be more about the staff's comfort than the business's capabilities.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the question is whether denying service based on the customer's gender identity is acceptable. Many would argue that businesses should serve all customers regardless of gender identity, especially if they can provide the service. The barbershop's policy is clear, but if it's applied in a way that excludes transgender or gender-nonconforming individuals, that could be problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The barbershop's policy is based on biological sex, but the customer is a woman who presents as male. The business could adjust by using the contracted female barber, which would allow serving the customer without violating religious beliefs. Since they didn't do that and instead denied service, it might be seen as discriminatory. Therefore, the author (the manager) could be in the wrong for not accommodating the customer despite having the means to do so.\n"
