We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the manager of a barbershop is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut, but the shop has a policy requiring appointments for women because they have only one female stylist who works by appointment. The shop's policy is based on religious beliefs\u2014specifically, that the male staff can't cut women's hair, but the female staff can. The customer felt they were transphobic and sexist, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or sexual orientation. If the customer identifies as a man but presents as male, the shop's policy based on gender might not account for that. The policy says they require appointments for women, but if the customer is a trans man, he might not consider himself a woman and thus should be served under men's services. However, the shop's policy is based on the customer's perceived gender, not their legal gender or identity.\n\nReligious exemptions are sometimes considered, but they don't always override anti-discrimination laws. The shop's reasoning is that male employees can't cut women's hair due to religious beliefs, but if the customer is a trans man, their gender identity complicates this. The shop might not have a clear policy on trans customers, which could lead to such situations.\n\nAlso, the shop's policy mentions they have a female stylist available by appointment. If the customer didn't book an appointment, maybe the manager could have offered to contact her if given a few hours' notice. However, the customer didn't want to wait. The manager's refusal might be based on the inability to provide immediate service and the employees' discomfort, which could be seen as not making a reasonable effort to accommodate the customer.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the shop's policy might be seen as excluding trans individuals who don't fit traditional gender roles. The customer felt discriminated against, and the manager's response could be viewed as not being inclusive. Even if the policy is based on religion, the impact on the customer's experience and potential legal implications need to be considered.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, in some jurisdictions, businesses are required to serve everyone regardless of gender identity. The shop's policy might inadvertently exclude trans men who are presenting as male but are perceived as female, leading to discrimination claims. The manager's refusal could be seen as transphobic, even if that wasn't the intention.\n\nHowever, the manager might argue that their policy is clearly stated online and in the shop, so customers should know to book appointments for women's services. The customer not booking an appointment could mean they didn't follow the policy, but if the customer identifies as a man, the policy's exclusion of women might not apply. The manager's stance that the policy is for the employees' comfort and religious reasons could be a defense, but it's a thin one legally.\n\nConsidering all this, the manager's actions might be seen as discriminatory because they didn't offer the service despite the customer's male-presenting identity. The policy doesn't account for gender diversity, leading to a failure to serve someone who should be eligible. Therefore, the manager is likely in the wrong.\n"
