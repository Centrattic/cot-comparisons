We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a barber shop manager who's being asked if they're in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The customer was a male-passing woman who came in without an appointment. The shop's policy is to require appointments for women because they have a female barber on contract. The manager explains that the staff isn't trained in women's haircuts due to religious reasons, specifically Islamic teachings that men shouldn't touch women's hair unless it's family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender or gender identity. Even if they have a religious exemption, there's a balance between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws. The shop's policy might be seen as discriminatory if it's not accommodating transgender or non-binary individuals. The customer was a woman who identifies as such, so the policy could be excluding them from services unnecessarily.\n\nAlso, the shop mentions that they state their policy on their website and signs, which could be part of their defense. However, just having a policy doesn't necessarily make it lawful, especially if it violates local anti-discrimination laws. The manager argues that they're protecting their employees' religious beliefs, but the customer felt discriminated against, leading to accusations of transphobia and sexism.\n\nAnother angle is the training aspect. The staff isn't trained for women's hair, which might affect the quality of service. But the customer was willing to have a men's style, which the staff could handle. The issue might be that the staff isn't trained to handle women's hair, even if the cut is similar. However, this could be a way to avoid providing service without considering alternatives like referring the customer to another barber or rescheduling with the female contractor.\n\nThe manager's response that they needed a couple of hours notice to call in the female employee suggests that the policy is more about availability than capability. But if the customer came in without an appointment, maybe the shop should have made an exception or offered to book an appointment then and there. The customer was upset and felt the policy was applied rigidly without flexibility.\n\nIn terms of religious accommodation, the employees have their own religious beliefs, but the business might still be required to serve customers without discrimination. There's a conflict between religious practices and public accommodation laws. Some places allow businesses to decline services based on religion, but others don't, especially when it comes to protected classes like gender identity.\n\nThe customer's reaction might be extreme, but the manager's policy could still be problematic. The key is whether the policy is applied in a way that's lawful and respectful of everyone's rights. The manager might be in the wrong if the policy discriminates against transgender or non-binary individuals, even if the intention is to comply with religious beliefs.\n\nIn conclusion, while the manager might have good intentions, the policy as applied could be discriminatory, leading to the conclusion that the author is in the wrong.\n"
