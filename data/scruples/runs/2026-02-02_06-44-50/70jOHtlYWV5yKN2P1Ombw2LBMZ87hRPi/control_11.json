We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a manager at a barbershop that primarily serves men and has a policy requiring appointments for women because they only have a contracted female barber. They mention religious reasons for not cutting women's hair, as per their Muslim faith. The situation involves a customer who is a male-passing woman wanting a man's style haircut without an appointment. The author refused, leading to accusations of transphobia, sexism, etc.\n\nFirst, consider the policies. The shop has clear policies stated online, so the customer should have known. The female barber is on appointment basis, so maybe the customer didn't check the website. However, the customer might not have identified as a woman when booking, complicating things. The shop's religious beliefs play a role here, but does that justify refusing service based on gender identity?\n\nThe key issue is whether the shop's refusal is discriminatory. Legally, in many places, businesses can't refuse service based on gender identity or expression. Even if the shop has religious exemptions, the argument is whether this applies to gender identity. Also, the customer is a trans man or non-binary person who presents as male, so they might not identify as a woman, making the appointment policy less applicable. The shop's policy might be excluding trans and non-binary individuals, which could be seen as transphobic.\n\nThe shop claims they don't train in women's hair due to religion, but that could be a factor in the policy. However, if the customer isn't identifying as a woman, the policy might not apply. The shop's solution would be to call in the female barber, but the customer didn't want to wait. The shop's stance might be considered discriminatory regardless of their policies. Even if they have rules, enforcing them in a way that excludes trans or non-binary individuals could be problematic.\n\nThe customer was upset and felt targeted. The shop's response was to stick to the policy, but the outcome might be seen as harmful. There's a balance between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws. Depending on the jurisdiction, the shop might be violating anti-discrimination laws by denying service based on gender identity. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not accommodating the customer despite the policies, especially if the customer doesn't identify as female.\n"
