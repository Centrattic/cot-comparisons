We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the barber is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The situation involves a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut, but the shop has a policy requiring appointments for women because they have a female barber on contract. The staff is Muslim, and there's a religious rule about not cutting women's hair unless it's family. They don't train in women's hair because of that.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the policy, the customer's identity, and the staff's comfort. The barber mentions that the policy is clear on their website and signage. The customer might have assumed they could walk in without an appointment since they present as male, but the policy is specifically for women. The staff's religious beliefs play a role here, but the shop serves a mixed clientele, mostly men.\n\nThe customer accused them of being transphobic and sexist. The barber argues that they need time to bring in the female barber and that the staff isn't trained for women's hair. But the customer was upset and left. \n\nI need to consider if the policy is discriminatory. Since the policy is clearly stated, the shop might not be at fault for not making an exception. However, the customer's gender identity could complicate things. If the customer identifies as a woman but presents as male, the policy might not cover them, but the shop's policy is about gender, not gender identity. \n\nAlso, the staff's religious beliefs might protect them under certain laws, but there's a balance between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws. In some places, businesses can't deny service based on gender identity. So, if the policy is based on the customer's assigned sex at birth rather than their gender identity, there's a problem. \n\nThe barber mentions the customer wanted a men's cut but the issue was about the policy for women. If the policy is rigid without exceptions for gender identity, that could be seen as discriminatory. The shop's policy might not account for transgender or non-binary individuals, leading to the conflict. \n\nIn conclusion, the barber might be in the wrong if the policy excludes people based on gender identity without accommodations. The answer would be A (yes), but I need to verify the nuances between gender presentation and policy enforcement.\n"
