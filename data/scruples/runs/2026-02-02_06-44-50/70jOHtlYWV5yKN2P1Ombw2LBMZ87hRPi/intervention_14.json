We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber shop manager, primarily male-focused with a Muslim staff. They have a policy of requiring appointments for women because their female barber is contracted and needs to be scheduled. The incident involves a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut but wasn't given one because of the appointment policy and religious reasons.\n\nFirst, the key points: The shop's policy is clear on their website and social media. They have one female barber on contract. The customer identified as a male-passing woman, so they might have wanted a men's cut but were told they needed an appointment for the female barber. The staff didn't feel comfortable cutting a woman's hair due to religious beliefs, but the customer was perceived as male, so maybe they thought they could get a men's cut without the appointment. The shop's reasoning is that they don't train in women's hair and have religious reasons for not cutting women's hair unless it's family. The customer felt discriminated against, called them transphobic and sexist, and left in anger.\n\nNow, considering the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, especially in the US, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. The customer is a woman who presents as male, so they are a female customer. The shop's policy of requiring appointments for women might be a form of discrimination because they're not offering the same services to all customers. The shop claims they can't cut women's hair due to religious reasons, but if the customer is female (even if they pass as male), the shop's refusal could be seen as gender-based discrimination. However, some might argue that the shop's religious beliefs are a protected right under anti-discrimination laws, but this is a complex area. For example, in some cases, businesses have been allowed to cite religious exemptions, but others have found that such policies disproportionately affect certain groups and thus aren't allowed.\n\nThe shop's policy is stated publicly, which might mitigate some blame, but if a customer is denied service based on gender identity, even if it's under the guise of policy, it could still be problematic. The customer might argue that they were discriminated against because they are a woman, regardless of how they present. The fact that the shop is Muslim might tie into the religious exemption, but laws vary by jurisdiction. In some areas, religious exemptions might be allowed, but in others, they aren't when it comes to public accommodations.\n\nAdditionally, the shop's reasoning about needing different products and tools for women's hair is a bit of a red herring. If the customer is presenting as male and wants a men's cut, the shop's claim about needing different tools doesn't apply. They might not have trained in women's hair, but if the customer is getting a men's cut, the staff's discomfort is based on gender, not the type of cut. The fact that they don't train in women's hair because of religion is part of the issue. It's about the staff's religious beliefs conflicting with the customer's right to service.\n\nThe shop's manager is the one making the call, and while they might feel they're protecting their employees' religious beliefs, it's a public business and they can't deny service to someone based on the customer's gender identity. The customer's reaction about being transphobic is valid if the shop is denying service based on gender. Even if the shop is Muslim, they can't override anti-discrimination laws that protect against gender-based discrimination. So the manager is in the wrong because they denied service to a customer based on their gender identity, which is a form of discrimination. The fact that they have a policy doesn't absolve them if the policy is discriminatory. The correct approach would be to adjust the policy to accommodate all customers, maybe by having the contracted female barber available for such cases, even if it requires rescheduling, but the manager insists on an appointment which the customer wasn't willing to provide. However, the manager could have offered a compromise instead of refusing outright. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
