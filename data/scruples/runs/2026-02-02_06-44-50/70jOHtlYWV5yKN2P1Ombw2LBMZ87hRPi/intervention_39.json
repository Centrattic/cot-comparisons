We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The situation involves a barber shop that primarily serves men, with a policy requiring appointments for women. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's style haircut. The shop has a policy of not cutting women's hair unless it's family, due to religious reasons, and they rely on a contracted female barber for women's appointments. The customer ended up feeling transphobic or sexist treatment and left angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies and the reasons behind them. The shop is Muslim, so the restriction on touching women's hair might stem from Islamic modesty laws, which vary in interpretation. However, the customer identified as a woman who presents as male and wanted a men's cut. The shop's policy is clear about appointments for women, but the customer didn't book one. The shop manager tried to explain the need for an appointment to bring in the contracted female barber, but the customer was upset and accused the shop of discrimination.\n\nNow, thinking about the legal and ethical angles. In many places, businesses can have policies based on religion, but they must also comply with anti-discrimination laws. For example, in the U.S., Title VII allows religious accommodations but requires employers to make reasonable efforts to serve all customers unless doing so would cause undue hardship. If the shop could accommodate the customer by using the contracted barber with some notice, that might be required. However, the shop argues that they can't cut women's hair due to religious beliefs and that they don't train on women's hair. But if the customer is presenting as male and wants a men's cut, maybe there's a conflict here between the customer's gender identity and the shop's policies.\n\nThe key issue is whether the shop's policy is based on the customer's gender identity or their perceived gender. If the shop is following a policy that requires appointments for women regardless of their gender identity, and the customer didn't have an appointment, then it's a policy enforcement issue. However, if the shop is denying service based on the customer's gender identity, that could be problematic. The shop's explanation is that they can't cut women's hair due to religious reasons, but the customer's situation is complicated because they're a woman who presents as male.\n\nAdditionally, the shop mentions that they require appointments for women to ensure they can be served properly, using the contracted female barber. If the customer is a woman, regardless of how they present, then the shop's policy is in place, and not following the appointment system could be a legitimate policy enforcement. However, if the customer is trans or non-binary and the shop's policy is based on their assigned gender, that might not align with their identity. There's also the aspect of whether the shop's policy is clear and communicated effectively, which they say it is through signage and online.\n\nIn terms of the employee's feelings, the shop manager mentions that none of the staff were comfortable cutting the customer's hair. But if the customer is a woman, the shop's policy is to use the female barber. The fact that the customer didn't book an appointment might mean the shop can't provide the service as per their policy, which could be a valid reason to decline.\n\nHowever, the customer's reaction of being called transphobic and sexist suggests a conflict in perception. The shop might see it as policy enforcement, but the customer perceives it as discrimination. The question is whether the shop's policy is a legitimate religious accommodation or a form of discrimination against trans or non-binary individuals.\n\nIn some cases, religious exemptions might allow businesses to refuse service based on religious beliefs, but there are limits. For example, in the U.S., the Supreme Court's Masterpiece Cakeshop case involved a baker refusing service for a same-sex wedding, but that was seen as targeting the customer's conduct rather than the customer's identity. If the shop is refusing service based on the customer's identity (gender identity), that might be a different scenario.\n\nAlso, the shop's policy states that women need appointments, which is communicated clearly. If the customer didn't follow the appointment system, the shop isn't at fault for enforcing their policy. But if the customer is presenting as male and the shop is enforcing a policy based on their assigned gender, that might not account for their gender identity.\n\nAnother angle is the shop's lack of training for women's hair due to religious reasons. If they can't provide the service regardless of the customer's gender identity, then it's a limitation. However, the existence of a contracted female barber suggests they can provide the service with notice, so the issue is whether they can make accommodations for customers who don't book appointments.\n\nIn conclusion, the shop's policy might be based on religious beliefs and clear communication, but if the customer's gender identity is at odds with the shop's policy, it could be seen as discriminatory. However, if the policy is consistently applied and the customer didn't book an appointment, the shop isn't necessarily in the wrong. The debate here is whether the policy is discriminatory or a legitimate religious practice with clear communication.\n"
