We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the barber who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a customer who is a male-passing woman wanting a haircut, but the shop only allows women's haircuts by appointment with a female barber due to religious reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The shop states their policy on their website and social media that they serve mostly men and require appointments for women. The customer wanted a men's cut but identifies as a woman. The staff is primarily Muslim, and there's a religious rule against men touching women's hair unless they're family. The female barber is contracted on an appointment basis. The shop claims they don't train staff on women's hair because of their religion, hence the policy.\n\nNow, the customer felt discriminated against and called them transphobic, sexist, etc. The author feels they had to protect their employees and provide proper service. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. Even if the policy is stated, if it leads to denying service based on gender identity, that could be illegal. The shop's policy might inadvertently exclude transgender or non-binary individuals. The fact that they have a female barber available but require appointments might not be enough if the customer's gender identity doesn't align with the policy.\n\nReligious exemptions vary. Some places allow religious exemptions for businesses, but they can't override anti-discrimination laws. The shop's policy might conflict with civil rights protections for LGBTQ+ individuals. Also, the argument about hair texture and tools might not hold up if the customer is presenting as male and wants a men's cut, which is the opposite of what the policy is about.\n\nThe employees' comfort is a factor, but if the business is open to the public, they can't base service denial solely on employee discomfort. Plus, the female barber is available for appointments, which could have resolved the issue. The customer might not have realized they needed an appointment, but the shop's policy being publicly stated isn't a defense if it results in discrimination.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because their policy, even if well-intentioned, leads to discrimination against transgender or gender non-conforming individuals. They should have either adjusted their policy to accommodate gender identity or trained staff to handle such cases without conflict.\n"
