We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the barber manager) is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The situation involves a trans woman who identifies as male-passing and wanted a men's haircut. The shop has a policy requiring appointments for women because their female barber is on a contract basis. The staff isn't trained in women's haircuts due to religious reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The shop's policy is clear about needing appointments for women, which is communicated through various channels. They have a female barber available when needed. The customer, however, identifies as male-passing and wanted a men's style, but the staff felt uncomfortable due to religious beliefs about not touching women's hair. The customer accused them of being transphobic, etc., and left upset.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. Even if their policy is for women, a trans woman is a woman under the law, so refusing service could be considered discrimination. The shop's policy might not account for gender identity, just the customer's appearance or declared gender. Also, the staff's religious beliefs shouldn't override legal obligations to provide service without discrimination. The author's decision to not provide the service based on the customer's gender (even if they're trans) could be seen as discriminatory. However, the shop does have a system in place to handle such cases by calling in the female barber if given notice. But the customer wasn't given that option on the spot, leading to conflict.\n\nAnother angle is the staff's training and comfort. If the staff isn't trained to handle women's haircuts due to religious reasons, but the shop still allows women to be served by the contracted barber, there's a policy to handle that. The customer's situation might not fit neatly into their existing system, but the shop's policy should ideally be inclusive of all customers, including trans individuals. The author might have failed to consider the customer's identity and the legal implications, leading to a conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, while the shop has policies in place for women, the way they handled the situation might have been discriminatory towards a trans woman. The author's refusal could be seen as in the wrong because they didn't account for the customer's gender identity and the legal requirement to serve all customers without discrimination.\n"
