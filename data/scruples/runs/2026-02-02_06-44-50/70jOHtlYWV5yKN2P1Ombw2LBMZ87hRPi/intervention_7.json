We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber shop manager in a Muslim-run business. They have a policy requiring appointments for women because they only have one female barber who works on a contract basis. The situation involves a customer who is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut. The shop's policy is set up because of religious reasons\u2014employees aren't allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, which applies to men but not women. So, the author didn't cut her hair because of the appointment system and the religious rules.\n\nThe customer felt discriminated against and accused them of being transphobic and sexist. The question is whether the author is at fault. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, discrimination based on gender identity is illegal. The customer identified as a female but presented as male. The shop's policy might be seen as discriminatory because they're not accommodating someone who identifies as a woman but is perceived as male. The policy is about requiring appointments for women, but if the customer is a trans woman, the policy might not apply. \n\nAlso, the reason behind the policy is religious, which might be a protected category. However, religious exemptions don't always override anti-discrimination laws. The shop states their policy clearly on their website and signage, which is good, but if the policy indirectly discriminates against a protected class (like gender identity or expression), it could still be problematic. \n\nThe shop argues that they don't train for women's hair due to religion. However, if the customer is a trans woman seeking a men's cut, the shop's reasoning might be invalid because the customer is not a woman in the context they're serving. Also, the shop could have made an exception by contacting the female barber, even if it required a few hours' notice. \n\nThe key points are: 1) The customer's gender identity and how the shop's policy applies to them. 2) Whether the policy is a legitimate business practice or a form of discrimination. 3) Legal obligations to serve all customers regardless of gender identity. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, businesses can't refuse service based on gender identity. Even if the policy is based on religion, it might not be a valid defense if it leads to discrimination. The shop's insistence on appointments without considering the individual's situation could be seen as inflexible and discriminatory. The employees' discomfort is important, but the business has a responsibility to serve all customers unless there's a specific exemption. \n\nTherefore, the author might be at fault for not making an exception in this case, especially if the customer's identity is woman and the policy is not applicable. The author didn't have to violate religious beliefs but could have adjusted the policy to accommodate. Hence, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
