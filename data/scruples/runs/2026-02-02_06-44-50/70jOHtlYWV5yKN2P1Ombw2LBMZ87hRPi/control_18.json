We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex because it involves religion, business policies, and customer service.\n\nFirst, the barbershop is primarily Muslim, and the staff has varying levels of religious adherence. They have a policy that requires appointments for women because they don't have female staff available unless contracted. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a haircut without an appointment. The author refused, citing the appointment policy and religious reasons\u2014since they can't touch women's hair unless it's family. The customer got upset and accused them of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the business's policy based on religious beliefs, the customer's identity as a transgender woman, and the refusal to serve them on the spot. The author argues that they have a policy that's clearly stated online and in signage. However, the customer might feel that the policy isn't applicable to them because they identify as a woman but present as male. But the author's policy is based on gender, not gender identity. That could be a problem because the customer's identity as a woman (transgender) is central here.\n\nReligious policies can sometimes be used as exemptions from anti-discrimination laws, but it's not always straightforward. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or religion unless they have a sincere religious belief. However, if the policy is applied to all women, regardless of their gender identity, it might be considered discriminatory. The author's staff isn't trained in women's haircuts due to religious reasons, which could be seen as a systemic issue.\n\nThe customer's argument is that they want a men's cut, but the business's policy is about gender, not the type of cut. So the policy might not be based on the service type but on the customer's gender. This could lead to discrimination against transgender individuals. The author might be in the wrong if their policy doesn't account for gender identity, thus excluding a person who identifies as a woman but presents and acts as a man.\n\nOn the other hand, the author mentions that they have a female barber available via appointment. If the customer could be scheduled with her, then the issue is about not allowing same-day service. But the customer might not have wanted to wait. The business's policy is in place for all women, so even if the customer is transgender, the policy applies. But if the policy is based on biological sex rather than gender identity, it could be problematic because many anti-discrimination laws protect gender identity, not just biological sex.\n\nThe author's employees not being comfortable cutting a woman's hair due to religious beliefs might also be a factor. However, if the business has a policy that allows for appointments with a female barber, then refusing service because of the customer's gender identity might still be an issue. The staff isn't trained in women's haircuts, but that's a business practice that could be challenged if it's based on discrimination.\n\nIn summary, the author might be in the wrong if their policy discriminates against transgender individuals by not recognizing their gender identity and applying the policy based solely on biological sex. However, if the policy is applied consistently to all women, including cisgender women, then it's a policy issue that might not be based on transphobia. But given that the customer is transgender and the policy doesn't account for their identity, the author could be seen as discriminatory. The answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the failure to accommodate the customer's gender identity and the potential for discrimination.\n"
