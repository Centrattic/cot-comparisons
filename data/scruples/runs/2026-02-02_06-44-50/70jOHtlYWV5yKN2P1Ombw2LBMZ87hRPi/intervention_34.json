We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a barber manager in a shop that's mostly Muslim, serving mostly men. They have a policy where women need appointments because they contract a female barber. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut. The shop's policy requires appointments for women because they don't have male barbers trained to cut women's hair due to religious reasons. On the day in question, none of the male employees were comfortable cutting the customer's hair, so they couldn't proceed without the female barber. The customer left angry, calling them transphobic and sexist, and the author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, the key points here seem to be the shop's policy, religious reasons, and the customer's identity. The shop states their policy publicly, which is clear. The customer didn't book an appointment, so maybe the shop followed their policy correctly. However, the customer identifies as a male-passing woman, which complicates things. If they pass as male, maybe they didn't realize they needed an appointment. \n\nThe shop's reasoning is that they can't cut women's hair due to religious beliefs, hence the appointment system for women. But if the customer is a woman, even if they pass as male, they still fall under the women's appointment policy. So, the shop's policy should apply regardless of appearance. However, if the customer didn't know they needed an appointment because they pass as male, perhaps the shop didn't make the policy clear enough. \n\nAnother angle is the religious training aspect. The employees aren't trained in women's haircuts because of their religion. So, the shop can't provide the service without the female barber. But if they can't serve the customer on the spot, is that discrimination? The customer might feel excluded even if the policy is in place. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong if the policy is too rigid and doesn't account for cases where someone doesn't fit neatly into the categories. For example, if a customer doesn't have a visible marker of gender, the policy might not be effectively communicated. Also, the shop's policy might be seen as discriminatory because it's based on gender, which could be problematic under anti-discrimination laws, especially if the customer is transgender or non-binary. However, if the shop is making accommodations for women by having a female barber, maybe they're not at fault. \n\nBut the main issue here is that the shop's policy is based on gender, and the customer's gender identity might not align with their assigned gender at birth. If the customer is a transgender man who presents as male but is legally female, the shop's policy could be discriminatory. However, if the shop is following their stated policy, they might not be at fault. \n\nOn the other hand, if the shop is refusing service based on gender, which is a protected category in some places, that could be legally problematic. The shop might be violating anti-discrimination laws by not providing service to a customer who is a woman, regardless of how they present. The fact that they can't serve women due to religious reasons might be a defense, but that depends on local laws and whether religious exemptions are allowed in such contexts.\n\nAdditionally, the shop's claim that they don't train in women's hair because of religion might not hold up if they can train employees to do women's hair without violating their religious beliefs. The appointment system for women is a workaround, but if they can't provide the service even when a woman is present, maybe they should adjust their training or policies.\n\nIn terms of the customer's reaction, they felt transphobic and sexist, which could be valid if the shop's policy is based on gender and the customer's gender identity is not respected. However, if the shop is making efforts to serve women through the appointment system, they might not be at fault.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the employees' comfort. If the employees are uncomfortable cutting the hair of someone they perceive as a woman due to religious reasons, but the customer doesn't present as female, it's a conflict. The shop's policy should ideally address such scenarios.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because the policy is based on gender, which could be discriminatory, and they didn't make clear the policy to all customers, especially those who might not fit neatly into the categories. Also, if the customer is transgender, the policy might not accommodate their needs properly.\n"
