We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a barber who's a manager at a Muslim-owned barbershop. They primarily serve men, have a female barber available by appointment only. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut. The shop's policy requires appointments for women because of religious reasons and training. The staff didn't feel comfortable cutting her hair, so they couldn't help her. She left upset, calling them transphobic, etc. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the religious aspect. The shop is primarily Muslim, and according to Islamic teachings, some interpretations prohibit men from touching women's hair and vice versa unless they are family. So the policy is based on that. But the question is whether enforcing this policy in this situation is discriminatory or not.\n\nThe customer identifies as a male-passing woman. If she presents as a man, maybe the shop could argue that she's being served as a man. However, the shop's policy is about gender, not gender identity. So if they require appointments for women regardless of how they present, they might be excluding trans women or non-binary people who are women. But if the policy is based on biological sex, then maybe it's a different case.\n\nBut there's a problem here. The shop is contracting a female barber for women's appointments. So they can provide the service if they have prior notice. The issue is that in this case, the customer didn't book an appointment and the male barbers couldn't serve her. The shop's stance is that they can't touch women's hair, which is a religious practice. However, the customer felt discriminated against because they were denied service based on their gender identity or expression.\n\nNow, in many places, anti-discrimination laws protect against gender identity and expression. If the shop is refusing service to someone because they don't fit the traditional gender norms, they might be violating those laws. For example, if the customer is a trans man, they might consider themselves a man and deserve to have their hair cut as such. The shop's policy based on biological sex might not account for that.\n\nAlso, the shop's reasoning that the female barber isn't trained in men's cuts is a bit weak. They could offer a basic men's cut to women if the female barber is available. The fact that they don't train male staff in women's cuts is a choice, but it's based on religious beliefs. However, this could be seen as refusing service based on gender or gender identity, which is illegal in some jurisdictions.\n\nAnother angle is the appointment system. If the shop requires appointments for women, that's a policy they've communicated through their marketing. But if the customer didn't know or didn't book an appointment, the shop is following their policy. However, the customer might argue that they were denied service because of their gender presentation, even if the policy exists. That's where the conflict lies.\n\nFrom the customer's perspective, they might feel that their gender identity is being ignored. If they present as a man and want a men's cut, the shop's refusal could be seen as transphobic. The shop might argue it's about adherence to religious practices, but that might not be a valid defense if the law protects against discrimination based on gender identity.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the employees' comfort. The shop mentions that none of the staff on the floor were comfortable cutting her hair for either religious or both reasons. But that's about employee discomfort rather than customer need. Legally, businesses can't refuse service based on employee discomfort if it's against anti-discrimination laws.\n\nIn summary, the author's position is based on religious beliefs and policy, but if those policies result in discrimination against trans or non-binary individuals, then they might be in the wrong. The key factors are whether the shop's policy is in violation of anti-discrimination laws and whether they're accommodating gender identity beyond just biological sex.\n"
