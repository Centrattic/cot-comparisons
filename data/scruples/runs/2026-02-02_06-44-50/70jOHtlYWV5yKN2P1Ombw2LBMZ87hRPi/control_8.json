We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a barber shop managed by the author, who is Muslim. They have a policy that women need appointments because there's a contracted female barber. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut but didn't have an appointment. The author and staff didn't feel comfortable cutting a woman's hair due to religious reasons, even though the customer presented as male.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. Even if the business has religious exemptions, they might still be required to serve all customers equally. The customer is a woman, regardless of how she presents, so denying service based on gender could be illegal. Also, the policy about appointments for women might be discriminatory if they don't enforce the same for men. \n\nThen there's the religious aspect. The employees have religious reasons for not cutting women's hair, but the business is supposed to serve everyone. The fact that they have a female contractor available when needed means they can accommodate women, but the policy isn't clear or consistent. If the customer didn't have an appointment, maybe they should have been informed of the policy beforehand. However, the customer might not have known about the appointment requirement for women and expected to be served regardless of gender presentation.\n\nThe customer was upset and accused the shop of being transphobic and sexist. If the staff didn't make the appointment policy clear upfront, especially since they advertise their services as available to all, then the shop could be at fault. The key issue is whether denying service based on gender identity without prior notice is discrimination. Even if the business has a religious exemption, they might still have a duty to accommodate by using the female contractor when needed, which the author mentions is possible with a few hours' notice. The customer didn't have a few hours, but maybe that's part of the policy they should have followed. However, if the shop didn't communicate this clearly, they might be responsible for not providing adequate notice of their policies.\n\nIn terms of the employees' comfort, while it's important to respect their beliefs, the business has a responsibility to serve all customers. The fact that they don't train for women's hair because of religion might be problematic. If the shop is in a place where anti-discrimination laws apply, they could be violating those by not providing service. Also, treating the customer as male-passing but female, the shop's policy based on legal gender might not align with the customer's gender identity, leading to perceived transphobia.\n\nSo putting it all together: The shop's policy might be discriminatory if they don't apply the same rules to men. The failure to clearly communicate the appointment policy for women could have led to this misunderstanding. The staff's religious reasons might not override the legal obligation to serve all customers. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not accommodating the customer despite having a female contractor available and for not clearly stating the appointment policy upfront.\n"
