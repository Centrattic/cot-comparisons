We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a barber who didn't cut a customer's hair because the customer identified as a male-passing woman, and the shop has a policy requiring appointments for women due to religious reasons and the lack of training among male staff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The shop is primarily Muslim, and their policy is based on religious beliefs about not touching women's hair unless it's family. They have a female barber available by appointment, which they advertise. The customer, who is a male-passing woman, wanted a men's cut but was told they needed an appointment. The customer felt this was discriminatory, and the staff felt they couldn't proceed due to both religious and practical reasons (different tools, training).\n\nNow, thinking about discrimination laws. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or sex. If the customer is a woman, even if they present as male, the business might be required to serve them. However, the shop has a female barber available. The issue here is whether the business is enforcing their policy consistently. They have a female contractor they can bring in, so not serving the customer because they're a woman (even if they pass as male) might be discrimination. \n\nBut there's also the religious accommodation aspect. The staff's religious beliefs might be a factor here. However, businesses can't use religious beliefs to justify discrimination. The shop has a solution (the female barber) but refused to use it, perhaps due to the customer's insistence on a same-day appointment. The customer might have a right to access the same services as others. \n\nThe shop's policy requires appointments for women, which is advertised. The customer might not have known about the appointment requirement, but the shop could have offered to schedule the female barber. By not doing so, they may have been inflexible. Also, the customer's gender identity complicates things. If they identify as male, but the shop's policy is based on biological sex, there's a potential conflict here. However, many jurisdictions protect against discrimination based on gender identity, so treating a transgender man as a woman in the service might not be appropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, the shop's employees are uncomfortable, which relates to their religious training. But if the shop can provide service through the female contractor, they should. The problem arises when they refuse service despite having a solution. The customer's complaint about being transphobic might be valid if the shop is treating them differently because of their gender identity, especially if they presented as male but were denied service based on the shop's policy for women. \n\nIn conclusion, the shop's policy might be discriminatory, even with the female contractor. They should have either accommodated the customer by scheduling the female barber or explained that they can't serve them regardless of appointments. Their refusal without offering an alternative could be in the wrong.\n"
