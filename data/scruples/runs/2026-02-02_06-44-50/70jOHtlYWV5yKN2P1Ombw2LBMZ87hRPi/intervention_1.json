We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The author is a barber and manager of a Muslim barbershop where they have a policy of requiring appointments for women because their male employees can't cut women's hair due to religious reasons. They mention having a female stylist who can do appointments, but on the day in question, the customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut. The shop didn't accommodate her, leading to accusations of transphobia, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. So if the customer identifies as a woman but presents as male, and the shop's policy is based on gender, that might be problematic. Also, the shop's policy of only serving women by appointment might be seen as gender-based discrimination. However, the shop is Muslim, so maybe there's a religious exemption? But in many countries, religious exemptions don't cover refusing service to LGBTQ+ individuals if it's considered discrimination. \n\nThen there's the aspect of the customer's gender identity. If the person is transgender or non-binary, the shop's policy might not account for that. The shop might be treating the customer as female based on their assigned gender at birth rather than their current identity. That could be an issue because the customer might not be comfortable being put into the female category, especially if they identify as male. \n\nThe shop's reasoning is that they have a female stylist for women's hair and male employees can't cut women's hair. But if the customer wants a men's cut, the shop could argue they can't do it because of the customer's gender. However, if the customer is presenting as male, the shop's policy might not apply. The problem is the shop's policy seems to be based on the customer's perceived gender at the time of arrival, which might not align with their actual gender identity. \n\nAlso, the shop's explanation about different tools and training for women's hair could be a policy, but if they have a female employee who can handle women's hair, they should be able to adjust when a woman (or someone presenting as male but identifying as female) comes in. The fact that they couldn't accommodate because they needed a few hours notice might be a logistical issue, but the customer might not be willing to wait. \n\nThe key here is whether the shop's policy is discriminatory. If they require appointments for women but not men, that's a gender-based policy. If the customer is a woman (trans or cis) who wants a men's cut, the policy should still apply, but the shop might not be able to serve them without the female employee. However, the customer might feel that the policy is unfair, especially if their gender identity doesn't align with the policy's assumptions. \n\nIn terms of legal and social standards, many places now protect against discrimination based on gender identity. So the shop might be in the wrong for not serving the customer, regardless of their policy. The employees' comfort isn't a valid reason for discrimination. The shop could retrain their employees or adjust policies to be more inclusive, but their current policy might not account for that. \n\nSo the author is likely in the wrong because they refused service based on gender-related policies without considering the customer's gender identity and legal protections against discrimination. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
