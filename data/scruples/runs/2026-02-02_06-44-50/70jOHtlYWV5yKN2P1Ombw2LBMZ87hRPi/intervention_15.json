We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a barber shop manager who didn't cut a customer's hair because the customer was a male-passing woman. The shop has a policy that women need appointments and are handled by the female barber. The customer wanted a men's haircut but was turned away because none of the staff (who are primarily Muslim) are comfortable cutting women's hair. The customer accused them of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies and the reasoning. The shop's policy is clear on their website and social media that they have a female barber on appointment basis. That part is transparent. The employees are following a religious rule where men aren't supposed to touch women's hair unless it's family. So, they don't train in women's hair because of this. The customer in question is a trans man or someone who is genderfluid but presenting as male. They wanted a men's cut, but the staff still couldn't serve them because of the policy.\n\nNow, the issue here is whether the shop is discriminating against transgender individuals. The customer might feel that since they don't need a women's haircut and are presenting as male, the policy is excluding them without reason. But the shop's policy is based on their religious beliefs and the need to have the female barber available for women. They also mention that the female barber is contracted for appointments, so they can't just call her in on the spot.\n\nThe key points are: the policy is publicly stated, the staff isn't trained in women's hair due to religious reasons, and they have a system in place for women. However, the customer might feel that their identity is being disregarded. The shop is following their policies, but the customer's experience is negative, leading to accusations of transphobia.\n\nIn terms of legality, in many places, businesses can have certain policies based on religion, but they also can't discriminate based on gender identity. However, this is a bit of a gray area. The shop is providing a service that's in line with their religious practices, but if the customer is transgender, they might be considered a protected class. The shop's policy might inadvertently exclude transgender individuals who don't fit into the traditional male/female binary.\n\nSo, from a policy standpoint, the shop followed their own rules. But from a social perspective, they might be seen as not accommodating transgender customers. The author might be in the wrong because the policy doesn't account for gender diversity. The staff's religious beliefs are important, but the way the policy is applied could be excluding people who don't fit the binary. The shop could adjust their policy to be more inclusive, perhaps by asking the customer's gender identity or providing a service that doesn't violate their beliefs. But as it stands, their policy is causing harm to a trans customer.\n"
