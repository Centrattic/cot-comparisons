We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber and manager who didn't cut a customer's hair because the customer is a male-passing woman. The shop has a policy of requiring appointments for women, and they don't train male barbers on women's hair due to religious reasons. The customer felt this was transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, the shop's policy is stated on their website and signage, so they're not secretly excluding anyone. However, the customer in question identified as male-passing, which complicates the policy. The shop's reasoning is based on religious beliefs and the need to provide appropriate service, using the female barber when necessary.\n\nBut here's the catch: the customer is presenting as male. The shop's policy is for women, but if someone is a woman who presents as male, does that policy still apply? The shop might be conflating gender with sex here. If the customer is transgender, the policy could unintentionally exclude them. The shop is using the appointment system as a way to handle women's hair, but if the customer is a trans man, they might not want to be treated as a woman. The staff's discomfort might also stem from religious beliefs, but refusing service based on that could be seen as discrimination, especially if the policy isn't clearly communicated or if there's no exception for such cases.\n\nThe key issue is whether the policy is applied consistently. If the shop is following the policy as written, and the customer is considered a woman for the purposes of the policy, then they might be in the right. But if the policy is based on biological sex and the customer is a trans man, the policy might be problematic. However, the shop's stance is that they don't cut women's hair unless it's family, which is their religious practice. The problem arises when that policy leads to discrimination against trans individuals who identify as men but are perceived as women.\n\nIn many places, discrimination based on gender identity is prohibited. So even if the policy is religious, it might conflict with anti-discrimination laws. The shop's employees are not trained to handle women's hair, which could lead to a lower quality service if they tried to cut a male-passing woman's hair. But the customer's main issue is that they were denied service for being trans, which could be seen as transphobic. The shop might not be in the wrong if their policy is based on their religious beliefs, but they could be violating laws that protect against discrimination. The answer hinges on whether the policy is applied fairly and if there are exceptions for customers who are trans, which the shop may not have considered.\n"
