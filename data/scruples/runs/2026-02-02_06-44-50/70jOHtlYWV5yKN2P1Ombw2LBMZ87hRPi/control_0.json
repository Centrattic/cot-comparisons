We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (a barber shop manager) is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The situation involves a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut, but the shop's policy requires appointments for women, and the staff isn't trained to cut women's hair religiously. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the shop's policy is clear: they require appointments for women because they have a contracted female barber. They mention this on their signage and social media. The customer, who identifies as male-passing but is a woman, argues that they want a men's style, so they should be treated like any other male customer. However, the staff isn't trained in women's haircuts due to religious reasons, and the policy is in place to ensure women can get the proper service.\n\nNow, the key points here are the policy, the reasoning behind it (religious training and appointments), and the customer's claim of discrimination. The author feels the policy is necessary for employee comfort and proper service, but the customer left upset, accusing them of transphobia, etc.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. By refusing service based on the customer's gender identity, they might be violating anti-discrimination laws. The shop's policy excludes a trans man (if that's the case) from receiving services, which could be considered discrimination. The fact that they have a contracted female barber doesn't negate the potential for discrimination if the customer is being turned away based on gender identity.\n\nReligious exemptions are sometimes considered in law, but they aren't a blanket excuse for discrimination. The shop's employees' comfort and training are part of the reasoning, but if the customer is being denied service based on their gender identity, that's problematic. Even if the policy is stated upfront, it doesn't exempt the business from legal responsibilities.\n\nThe author might argue that they're following religious guidelines, but if the law protects against discrimination, they could be in the wrong. The customer's right to access services without facing prejudice should be balanced against the shop's religious practices. However, laws in many places prioritize anti-discrimination over religious exemptions in public accommodations.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author probably is in the wrong because they denied service based on gender identity, which is a protected class in many jurisdictions. The shop's policy as stated doesn't account for gender identity, leading to unintended discrimination.\n"
