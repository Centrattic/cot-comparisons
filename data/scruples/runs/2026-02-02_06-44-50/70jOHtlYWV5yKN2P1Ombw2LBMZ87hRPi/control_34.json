We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (a barbershop manager) is at fault for not cutting a customer's hair. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut. The shop has a policy of requiring appointments for women because their staff isn't trained for women's hair and there's a religious rule about not touching women's hair unless it's family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policy. The shop explicitly states on their website and signage that they require appointments for women, which is clear. The customer might not have checked these details, or maybe they thought their appearance as male-passing would allow them to bypass the policy. However, the policy isn't about gender identity per se, but about the availability of trained staff. The shop only has a female barber who works on an appointment basis, so without her, they can't serve women. The manager mentions that the staff isn't trained for women's hair due to religious training. \n\nNow, the customer identifies as male-passing but wanted a men's cut. The shop's policy is based on the hair type and training, not gender identity. The customer might have thought since they present as male, the policy shouldn't apply. However, the staff's inability to cut women's hair is due to both training and religious reasons. The manager feels they can't compromise on employee comfort and safety, as the staff isn't trained and might not be comfortable. \n\nThe customer accused the shop of being transphobic and sexist, which complicates things. The manager is trying to balance business policy, employee comfort, and customer service. They offered to arrange an appointment with the female barber but the customer refused. \n\nLegally, in some places, businesses can have policies based on gender, but if a customer's gender identity is male, but they have hair typically associated with women, does the policy still apply? The shop's policy is about the hair type, not gender. If the customer's hair is considered women's hair, the policy applies regardless of their gender identity. However, if their identity as male is genuine, there might be an issue with the policy's application. But the shop's reasoning is about the staff's training and religious practices, not the customer's gender. \n\nEthically, the shop is being honest about their policies, which are clearly communicated. They aren't refusing service based on gender identity but based on the type of service they can provide. The manager is also considering employee comfort, which is valid. The customer might have had a different expectation, but the shop isn't in the wrong for upholding their stated policies and religious practices. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the manager probably isn't in the wrong. They followed their policy, communicated it clearly, and tried to offer an alternative. The conflict arises from the customer's misunderstanding or disagreement with the policy, not the shop's actions. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
