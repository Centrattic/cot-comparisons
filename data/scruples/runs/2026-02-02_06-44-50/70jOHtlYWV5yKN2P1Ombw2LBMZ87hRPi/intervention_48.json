We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not cutting the customer's hair. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a manager at a barbershop that's predominantly Muslim. They mention they serve mostly men and have a policy requiring appointments for women to book the contracted female stylist. The customer in question was a male-passing woman who wanted a man's style haircut. The staff didn't feel comfortable cutting her hair because of religious reasons\u2014specifically, not being allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, and the fact that they don't train in women's hair. The customer accused them of being transphobic, sexist, and bullies, and left in a huff. The author feels bad but is concerned about employee comfort and service quality.\n\nThe key points here are the policies they've set and their reasons for them. They stated on their website, Facebook, etc., that appointments are required for women. The customer might not have checked those details. However, the customer identified as a male-passing woman seeking a men's cut, which complicates things. The staff's refusal might be based on religious beliefs, but also on lack of training for women's hair. The customer felt discriminated against.\n\nNow, discrimination laws often protect against gender identity and expression. Even if the policy is for women, if the customer identifies as male, they might not be subject to the same policy. But the barbershop's policy is based on the customer's gender as per the appointment system. However, if the customer is transgender and presents as male, but their gender is female legally or self-identified, there's a conflict here. The staff's refusal could be seen as transphobic if they're not willing to serve someone based on their gender identity, even if the policy is for women.\n\nThe author's reasoning includes religious beliefs and employee comfort. But in many places, businesses can't cite religion to discriminate against customers, especially in public accommodations. The staff's training and policy might be their own beliefs, but the business might be legally obligated to serve all customers regardless of their background. Also, the fact that they can call in the female stylist with a few hours notice suggests that the policy could be flexible if the customer had given notice. The customer might have been in a rush, but the policy isn't a reason to deny service under any circumstances.\n\nAnother angle is the customer's experience. They felt mistreated and accused of being transphobic. The barbershop's actions might be seen as discriminatory because they refused service based on the customer's gender identity, which is protected under anti-discrimination laws in many regions. The staff's refusal to accommodate might be based on outdated policies that don't consider the nuances of gender identity.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because the policy as applied could be discriminatory, especially if the customer's gender identity doesn't match the policy's criteria. The business should adapt their policies to be inclusive of all gender identities, and the staff should be trained to provide service without discrimination, possibly through the contracted stylist even if it requires adjusting the appointment system.\n"
