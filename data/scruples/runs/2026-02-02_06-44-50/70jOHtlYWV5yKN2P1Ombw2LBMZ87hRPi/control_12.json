We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber shop manager in a predominantly Muslim setting. They have a policy that requires appointments for women because their female barber is contracted and not always available. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut. The shop's policy and religious beliefs prevent male barbers from cutting women's hair, so they couldn't accommodate her on the spot.\n\nFirst, the religious aspect: In some interpretations of Islam, men are not supposed to touch women who are not their mahrams. This could be a reason for the policy. However, the customer identifies as a woman but presents as male and wants a men's cut. This complicates things because if the customer is presenting as male, maybe the barbers would see them as a male customer. But the shop's policy is about gender, not gender identity. \n\nThe shop's website and social media clearly state they require appointments for women. If the customer didn't check, that might be on them. But if the shop is public, people might not know the policy. However, the manager argues that they can't train male staff on women's hair due to religious reasons, so they rely on the appointment system. The customer was upset and called them transphobic, which is a serious accusation.\n\nOn one hand, the shop has a policy based on religious beliefs and operational constraints. They can't serve the customer on the spot because of that. On the other hand, the customer's gender identity might not align with the shop's gender-based policies. The shop's policy is gender-based, which could be problematic if it leads to discrimination. But if the customer is transgender and presents as male, there's an argument that the shop should serve them as a male customer. However, the shop's policy is strict about gender, not gender identity, which could lead to conflict.\n\nAlso, the shop manager mentions that they require appointments for women because they need to bring in the female barber. If the customer is a woman, even if she presents as male, they can't serve her without the female barber. But if the customer is transgender and identifies as male, maybe the shop should treat them as a male customer. However, in their religious context, the rule is about biological sex, not gender identity. So even if the customer identifies as male, if they are biologically female, the barbers can't serve.\n\nThis is a complex situation. Legally, in some places, businesses can have religious exemptions, but if the policy leads to discrimination against transgender individuals, that could be an issue. The shop's policy is clear, but the customer might not have known. The manager has to balance religious practices with potential discrimination. The answer depends on whether the policy is based on gender identity or biological sex, and how that intersects with local laws against discrimination. If the shop is enforcing a policy based on biological sex without considering gender identity, they might be seen as transphobic. But if the policy is based on religious beliefs and they clearly state it, they might not be in the wrong. However, refusing service to someone who is transgender and presenting as male could be problematic if the policy doesn't account for gender identity. So the manager might be in the wrong if the policy doesn't consider gender identity, but if the policy is based on religious beliefs that don't recognize gender identity, then it's a different story. It's a tough call, but the manager's answer might be B (not in the wrong) if the policy is clear and based on religious beliefs, but A (in the wrong) if the policy discriminates against transgender individuals.\n"
