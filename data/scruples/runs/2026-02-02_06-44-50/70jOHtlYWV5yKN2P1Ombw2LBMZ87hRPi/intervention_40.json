We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the barber manager) is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The situation involves a male-passing woman who wanted a haircut but the shop only serves women by appointment through their female barber.\n\nFirst, the shop's policies are clear: they state on their website and social media that appointments are required for women. The reason given is the religious belief that male employees can't touch women's hair unless it's family, and they don't train in women's hair. They have a female contractor they call in for female customers. \n\nThe customer here is a male-passing woman. She wanted a men's style cut, but the shop's policy requires appointments for women. The manager refused because the staff wasn't trained and there was the religious restriction. The customer accused them of being transphobic and sexist, then left angry. The manager is defending the decision by saying they need to protect their employees and provide proper service.\n\nI need to consider a few angles. Legally, in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity, but there's also the argument about religious exemptions. However, the business is in the service industry and may have a duty to serve all customers unless there's a legitimate reason. If the shop clearly states their policy about women needing appointments, but a customer doesn't fit neatly into that (as someone who is transgender), there might be a problem. \n\nThe shop's policy is set up for cisgender women, but when a trans woman comes in, they might not have the same procedures. If the shop is refusing service based on gender, but the customer identifies as female, then it's a conflict. The manager might argue it's about the appointment system, but the customer might see it as refusing service because they're a woman. Also, the fact that they have a female contractor available suggests they can accommodate women, but perhaps not in an emergency or walk-in scenario. \n\nThe manager's reasoning includes both religious beliefs and operational policies. However, if the customer is a woman, regardless of gender identity, and the shop has a policy against serving women except by appointment, then maybe the manager is wrong for not accommodating the appointment request. But the customer might have needed a same-day service, and the manager is unwilling to make exceptions. \n\nAnother point is that the shop's policy might not account for transgender customers. If the policy is based on biological sex, then a trans woman would be considered a woman, and the shop's refusal could be seen as discrimination. If the policy is based on gender identity, then the shop would need to adjust their procedures. \n\nThe manager might be in the right if they followed their established policy, but if the policy itself is discriminatory (due to religious practices), there could be legal implications. However, in some jurisdictions, religious exemptions might protect the business. But if the policy is more about the appointment system and the staff's lack of training, that's a different angle. \n\nBut considering that the shop does have a female stylist available, it's possible that the manager could have made an exception to call her in, even if it wasn't a scheduled appointment. The fact that the customer was angry and called them transphobic suggests that the manager's refusal was perceived as discriminatory. \n\nI think the manager's main issue is not the policy itself, but how they applied it in this specific case. The shop's policy might be clear for cisgender women, but when a trans woman comes in, the policy might not be inclusive. The manager's refusal could be seen as discriminatory if they don't make accommodations for transgender customers. \n\nSo, even if the policy is in place for religious reasons, the manager might still be in the wrong for not handling this situation sensitively. They could argue that they need the appointment system, but if the customer is a woman (transgender or cisgender) and the shop can accommodate her with the female contractor, then refusing based on the policy might be discriminatory. \n\nTherefore, the manager might be in the wrong for not adjusting their policy in this case, even if the policy is generally in place. They should consider revising their policy to be more inclusive of transgender customers or at least find a way to accommodate them without compromising their religious beliefs.\n"
