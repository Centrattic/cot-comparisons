We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber shop manager asking if they're in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The customer identified as a male-passing woman but wanted a men's cut. The shop has a policy requiring appointments for women because male barbers aren't trained to do women's hair due to religious beliefs, and they have a female stylist available on appointment.\n\nFirst, the shop clearly states their policy online, so the customer should have known beforehand. The manager explains that the policy is in place to ensure proper service and accommodate religious practices. The customer didn't make an appointment, so the shop couldn't provide the necessary service. They also mention that the staff isn't trained for women's hair, which could lead to unsatisfactory results.\n\nThe customer accused the shop of being transphobic, but the manager isn't denying service based on gender identity. The policy is about gender as per the appointment system, but the customer in question is a woman who wanted a men's cut. The shop's policy is about gender, not gender identity, so if they serve women, they might have to adjust. However, the key issue is the lack of training and the specific appointment system. The manager is trying to respect both the employees' religious beliefs and provide quality service. \n\nThe customer didn't follow the policy, leading to a conflict. The manager isn't refusing service based on discrimination against trans people but rather sticking to established policies for staff training and religious practices. The manager is trying to balance employee comfort and service quality. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
