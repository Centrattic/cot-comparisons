We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a barber who refused to cut a customer's hair because the customer is a male-passing woman, and the shop's policy requires appointments for women. The shop has a Muslim staff with religious reasons for not cutting women's hair unless it's family, and they don't train in women's hair. The customer got upset and accused them of transphobia and sexism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The barbershop has a policy stated online and in signage that they require appointments for women, which is why they have the female contractor. The customer in question identifies as a male-passing woman but wanted a men's cut. The staff wasn't trained to handle women's hair due to religious reasons, and none were comfortable cutting her hair. The author, as the manager, had to turn her away, leading to the accusation of discrimination.\n\nNow, the legal angle: in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. Even if the policy is for women, a male-passing woman might still be considered a woman in terms of gender identity. The shop's policy explicitly requires appointments for women, which could be problematic if it excludes transgender women or non-binary individuals who identify as women. However, if the policy was clearly communicated, maybe there's a defense. But the customer might argue that the policy is discriminatory regardless of their passing.\n\nReligious exemptions are sometimes allowed, but they don't always override anti-discrimination laws. The shop's religious reasons for not cutting women's hair could be a factor, but if the refusal is based on the customer's gender identity, that's a different issue. The shop's policy of requiring appointments for women might not accommodate for someone who doesn't fit neatly into the gender categories they're prepared for.\n\nThe staff's discomfort is mentioned, but that's not a valid reason to refuse service. If a business can't accommodate a customer due to staff training or policy, they should either find a way to provide service (like calling in the female contractor) or politely decline. However, the author says they needed a couple of hours notice to get the contractor, but the customer was unwilling to wait. Is the shop responsible for that? If the policy is clear, maybe the customer is at fault for not booking an appointment. But if the policy isn't clearly communicated or is discriminatory, that's another matter.\n\nAlso, the fact that the shop serves all sorts of customers but has a specific policy for women could be seen as discriminatory. The customer felt targeted because they are trans, which is a protected class in many jurisdictions. Even if the shop's policy is for cisgender women, trans women should be included in that policy. The shop's reasoning based on religious beliefs might not hold up in court if it leads to discrimination against a protected class.\n\nAdditionally, the shop's argument about different tools and products for women's hair is a business justification, but if they can't provide the service, they need to either find a way to accommodate or let the customer go. The staff's training is their responsibility. The fact that they don't train in women's hair due to religion might be a business choice, but if it leads to exclusion of certain customers, it could be problematic.\n\nIn summary, the shop's policy might be discriminatory based on gender identity. The author's refusal could be seen as transphobic, even if the intent was based on religious practices and existing policies. The key is whether the policy, as written, inadvertently excludes protected groups. The author might not be in the wrong from a religious standpoint, but legally and ethically, there's a case to be made that they were discriminatory.\n"
