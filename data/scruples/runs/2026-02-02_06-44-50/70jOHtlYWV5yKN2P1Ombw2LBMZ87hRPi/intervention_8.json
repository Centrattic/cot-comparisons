We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber shop manager who claims they didn't cut a customer's hair because the customer was a male-passing woman, and their policy requires appointments for women. They mention that their staff isn't trained for women's hair due to religious reasons. The customer felt they were transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the shop's policy, the customer's identity, and the reasons given for not serving them. The shop states they have a policy requiring appointments for women, which is communicated on their website and social media. They have a female stylist they contract for women. The customer, who identifies as a trans man or male-passing woman, wanted a men's cut but was denied because of the policy. The manager argues that the staff isn't trained for women's hair due to religious reasons, thus only women get served via appointment with the female stylist.\n\nLegally, in many places, discrimination based on gender identity or expression is prohibited. Even if the shop has a policy, if it results in denying service to someone based on their gender identity, it could be considered discriminatory. The customer's gender identity isn't the same as their biological sex. If the shop is using the policy to exclude trans or non-binary individuals, that's a problem.\n\nEthically, the shop's policy might be well-intentioned, but applying it in a way that excludes people based on stereotypes or assumptions about their hair needs or religious practices could be seen as discriminatory. The customer's right to access services without facing prejudice is important. The staff's discomfort or lack of training shouldn't override the customer's right to be served, especially if there's an alternative solution, like the manager mentioned calling in the female stylist with a few hours' notice. However, the customer was upset and left, but the manager might have had a valid reason to maintain the policy for their staff's comfort and service quality.\n\nHowever, the manager's response to the customer's complaint could have been better. Instead of enforcing the policy rigidly, perhaps offering to book an appointment with the female stylist would have been more inclusive. The fact that the policy exists for appointments for women but the customer was denied might indicate a misunderstanding of the customer's identity. The customer's presentation as male-passing complicates things, but their gender identity shouldn't be a barrier. The shop's policy might not account for non-binary or trans individuals, leading to unintended discrimination.\n\nIn terms of religious exemptions, some jurisdictions allow businesses to claim exemptions based on religion, but others do not, especially if it infringes on others' rights. There's a balance between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws. If the shop is a public accommodation, they might be required to serve all customers regardless of religion. The manager's approach here seems to lack flexibility and could be seen as using religion to justify discrimination.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the manager's policy and enforcement might be in the wrong, even if the intention was to avoid religious discomfort. The customer's experience of being transphobic and sexist is a serious accusation, and the manager's refusal to accommodate by calling in the female stylist when possible could be seen as not making a reasonable effort to serve the customer. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
