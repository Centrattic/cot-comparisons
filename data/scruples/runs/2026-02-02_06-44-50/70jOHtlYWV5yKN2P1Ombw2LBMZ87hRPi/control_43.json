We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is a barber shop manager who mostly serves men and has a policy requiring women to book appointments with their female barber. They had a situation where a male-passing woman came in, wanted a haircut, but since it's a last-minute request and they don't have their female barber available, they refused. The customer accused them of being transphobic, sexist, etc. The manager is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies in place. They clearly state on their website and signage that appointments are required for women. The reason given is both religious (male employees can't touch women's hair unless it's family) and practical (different tools, products). The manager explains that they don't train the male staff in women's hair. So, the policy is upfront.\n\nThe customer in question is a male-passing woman. They might not have identified as a woman when entering, so maybe the manager didn't realize they needed an appointment. But the policy applies to all women, regardless of how they present. The manager argues that they need time to bring in the female barber, which isn't possible in a walk-in. \n\nThe customer got upset and accused them of discrimination. The manager feels bad but is trying to protect employees and maintain service quality. The key here is whether the policy is discriminatory or not. If the policy is clearly stated and applies to all women equally, then it's a business policy. However, if the refusal was based on gender identity or gender expression, that's a different issue. But the manager's policy is based on the customer's gender as per their business's requirements.\n\nReligious accommodation is a factor. The employees' religious beliefs might justify certain practices, but the business also has to comply with anti-discrimination laws. However, in many places, businesses can have dress codes or grooming policies based on gender, but when it comes to services, there's a balance. For example, if the business is in a state where religious exemptions allow such policies, they might be okay. But if the law requires serving all customers regardless of gender identity, then the policy could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle: the customer was a woman who presented as male. Did the manager know the customer's gender at the time of the refusal? If they didn't know and the customer didn't mention they identified as a woman, then the policy might not have been applied correctly. But if the manager's policy is based on how a customer presents, that could be an issue. If the customer was perceived as male at first, the staff might not have known to apply the women's appointment policy, leading to the conflict.\n\nAlso, the manager's statement about not training in women's hair. If the business chooses to specialize in men's hair, that's their right. But excluding women entirely might be considered discriminatory unless there's a valid, non-discriminatory reason. The appointment system is a workaround to serve women, which shows they do accommodate them when possible.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, in many countries, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. If the policy doesn't allow transgender women to be served without an appointment, that could be a problem. However, if the business is transparent about their policy and the customer didn't follow it, maybe they have a case. But if the customer didn't know the policy or felt it was unfair, the manager's approach might need adjustment.\n\nThe manager's intention was to follow policies and protect employees from uncomfortable situations. But the customer felt disrespected and targeted. The manager might need to consider clearer communication of the policy and perhaps offer alternatives, like rescheduling or explaining the process, rather than a flat refusal.\n\nIn conclusion, the manager's policy is in place and communicated, but the situation might highlight a gap in how they handle customers who don't fit neatly into their stated policies. While the policy has religious and practical reasons, the manager could be seen as not accommodating gender identity if the customer is transgender. However, if the policy is based solely on biological sex and the customer identifies as a woman, then the manager might be in the wrong for not accommodating. It's a complex issue with legal and ethical considerations.\n"
