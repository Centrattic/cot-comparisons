We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about a barber who didn't cut a customer's hair because the customer is a male-passing woman, and the shop has a policy requiring appointments for women. The shop has a female barber on contract, but the day in question, the staff wasn't comfortable cutting the customer's hair due to religious reasons. The customer accused them of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The shop's policy is clear on their website and social media that they require appointments for women. So when a customer comes in, even if they present as male, but identify as a woman, the policy might not cover them. But the customer might not have known that policy. However, the shop is a for-profit business, and they have to provide service to all customers without discrimination based on protected classes, which includes gender identity and sex in many places. \n\nThe shop's reasoning is religious, specifically Islamic practices where men aren't supposed to touch women's hair unless it's family. But the customer here is a transgender woman or a non-binary person who presents as male. There's a conflict here between religious practices and anti-discrimination laws. The shop might be protected under religious exemptions, but that depends on the jurisdiction. However, in many places, anti-discrimination laws take precedence in public accommodations. \n\nThe shop did offer to reschedule with the female barber, but the customer didn't want to wait. The shop claims they were protecting their employees' religious beliefs, but the employees could have been trained or the policy adjusted. Also, if the shop is refusing service to a customer based on their gender identity, that's a problem. \n\nThe key points are: the shop's policy is clear, but when a customer doesn't fit neatly into the categories, the shop's refusal might be discriminatory. The shop's employees' discomfort is a valid concern, but the business has a responsibility to serve all customers unless there's a legitimate reason. The fact that they have a female barber available suggests they can accommodate women, but in this case, the customer didn't make an appointment. However, the customer might not have been aware of the policy or might have presented as male when entering, leading to confusion. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the shop is prioritizing their religious beliefs over the customer's needs, which could be seen as discriminatory. The customer feeling transphobic and sexist is valid because the shop is essentially refusing service based on their gender identity. The shop's policy might not account for non-binary or transgender individuals, which is a gap in their policy. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they refused service to a customer based on gender identity, which could be discriminatory, even if they have religious reasons. However, there's a legal aspect depending on the location. But generally, public accommodations laws require serving everyone regardless of gender identity, so the shop's actions could be illegal. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
