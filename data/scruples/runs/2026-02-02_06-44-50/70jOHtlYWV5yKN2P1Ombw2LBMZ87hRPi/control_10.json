We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a barber shop manager, primarily Muslim, with a staff that includes both strict and more secular employees. They have a policy where women must book appointments, and they have one contracted female barber. The situation was a customer who's a male-passing woman wanted a haircut. The staff didn't feel comfortable cutting her hair due to religious reasons, so they couldn't provide the service. The customer accused them of being transphobic, sexist, etc., and left upset.\n\nFirst, the policy is clear: appointments for women. The manager states that the staff isn't trained in women's haircuts because of religious beliefs. But the customer identifies as a male-passing woman, so they fall into the category that requires an appointment. The manager needed to call the female barber, which would take a couple of hours notice. The customer didn't want to wait or book an appointment, leading to the conflict.\n\nIs the manager wrong? Let's consider. The business has a policy stated publicly, so the customer should have known to book an appointment. However, the customer's gender identity might complicate this. The staff's refusal based on religion could be seen as discriminatory. Even though the policy exists, applying it in a way that excludes transgender or non-binary people could be problematic. \n\nThe key points here are the religious policy vs. discrimination. In some places, businesses can claim religious exemptions, but others prioritize non-discrimination laws. If the shop is in a place where such laws protect gender identity, then the manager might be violating those laws. The customer was denied service not as a woman, but as a trans person, which could be more about transphobia than sexism.\n\nThe manager mentions that the employees aren't comfortable due to religious reasons. But if the policy is about requiring appointments for women, and the customer is a woman (regardless of appearance), the policy should apply. However, if the staff is uncomfortable based on gender identity, that could be discrimination. The fact that the shop has a female barber available but needed to be called in suggests that the policy is in place, but the execution was an issue because the customer didn't have notice.\n\nAlso, the customer might feel that being required to book an appointment based on their gender presentation is unfair, especially if they pass as male. But since the policy is for all women, it's a blanket policy. However, if the staff is refusing based on their own comfort due to religious beliefs, that might cross into discrimination, even if the policy is in place.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, businesses are generally expected to serve all customers regardless of gender identity. Even if the policy is in place, the execution that leads to discrimination could be problematic. The manager might be in the wrong for not accommodating the customer's needs within the existing policy, or the policy itself might be discriminatory.\n\nSo, the answer is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the shop's policy and the staff's refusal based on gender identity can be seen as discriminatory, even if rooted in religious beliefs. The manager's responsibility to provide service without discrimination might override the religious exemption in this case.\n"
