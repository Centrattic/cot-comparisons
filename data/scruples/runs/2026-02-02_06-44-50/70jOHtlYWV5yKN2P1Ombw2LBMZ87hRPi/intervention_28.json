We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber and manager at a Muslim-owned barbershop that primarily serves men. They have a policy requiring appointments for women, using a contracted female barber. The situation involves a customer who is a male-passing woman who wanted a haircut but didn't make an appointment. The barbershop staff is uncomfortable cutting her hair due to religious reasons and lack of training.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. The customer is a transgender individual presenting as male, but legally, they might still be considered female. The shop's policy of only allowing the contracted female barber to cut women's hair could be problematic if it excludes someone based on gender identity.\n\nThe shop's reasoning is religious, specifically Islamic law which prohibits men from touching women's hair unless it's family. However, religious accommodations for businesses don't override anti-discrimination laws. The shop might be allowed to have certain policies based on religion, but if those policies lead to discrimination against protected classes (like gender identity), they might be in violation.\n\nThe customer was denied service without an appointment, but the shop could have rescheduled or adjusted the appointment system. The fact that the shop is Muslim and the staff's discomfort is based on religion adds another layer. The customer felt transphobic and sexist, which are serious accusations. Even if the shop's intent wasn't malicious, the effect could still be discriminatory.\n\nThe employees' comfort is valid, but the business has a responsibility to serve all customers unless there's a legitimate health, safety, or legal reason. Since the shop's policy is written to accommodate women through appointments, but in this case, it didn't apply because the customer didn't make one, maybe the policy isn't flexible enough. Also, the customer's explanation about wanting a men's cut might not change the underlying policy based on gender.\n\nIn conclusion, while the shop's policy is rooted in religious beliefs, the refusal to serve a customer based on perceived gender identity without an appointment could be seen as discriminatory. The shop could be in the wrong if their policy doesn't account for exceptions or if they could make accommodations. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't make an effort beyond their standard policy to accommodate the customer, leading to discrimination.\n"
