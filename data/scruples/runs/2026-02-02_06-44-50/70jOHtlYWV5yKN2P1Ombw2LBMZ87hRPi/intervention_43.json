We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the barbershop manager is in the wrong for not cutting a male-passing woman's hair. The situation involves religious practices and business policies.\n\nFirst, the barbershop has a policy of requiring appointments for women because they don't offer women's haircuts unless through their contracted female barber. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's style haircut but didn't have an appointment. The manager explains that the staff isn't trained for women's hair due to religious reasons, and they didn't want to make employees uncomfortable. The customer left upset, accusing them of transphobia, sexism, etc.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to determine if that's accurate. \n\nLet's break it down. The barbershop is a business, so they have the right to set policies. However, by having a policy that requires appointments for women, they might be limiting access for transgender individuals who don't identify as women but present as male. The policy is based on the gender of the customer, not their biological sex or identity. If the customer identifies as male, the policy may not apply, which is where the conflict arises.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the policy discriminates against transgender people. The barbershop's policy is based on the customer's gender as perceived by the business, which could conflict with the customer's self-identified gender. If the customer is transgender and identifies as male, the policy of requiring an appointment based on perceived gender might be discriminatory. The barbershop's refusal to serve them in this case could be seen as transphobic if they are not willing to accommodate their identity.\n\nAdditionally, the business's policy is rooted in religious beliefs, but anti-discrimination laws often require accommodations for individuals, especially in public services like barbershops. Even if the policy is clear on their website, if a customer's identity doesn't align with the policy's criteria, the business might be violating their rights by enforcing the policy rigidly without considering the customer's self-identification.\n\nThe manager argues that the staff isn't trained for women's hair, but if the customer is presenting as male and requesting a men's cut, the staff's training might not be an issue. The problem arises when the policy is applied based solely on perceived gender, not the customer's actual identity. This could lead to discrimination against transgender individuals.\n\nTherefore, the author's policies may be in the wrong by not considering the customer's gender identity and enforcing a rule that could be seen as discriminatory. Even if the policy is stated, there's a responsibility to assess each individual's identity and provide service accordingly. The business might need to adjust their policies to be inclusive, perhaps by asking for the customer's gender identity rather than relying on appearance.\n"
