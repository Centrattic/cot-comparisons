We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the barber shop manager) is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The situation involves a customer who is a male-passing woman seeking a men's haircut. The shop has a policy requiring appointments for women because they don't have female barbers on-site except for a contracted stylist.\n\nFirst, the shop's policy is clear on their signage, social media, and website. So the customer should have known about the appointment requirement for women. The manager explains that their religious beliefs mean male staff can't cut women's hair unless it's family, and they don't train in women's hair. The key points here are the policy being communicated, the religious reasons, and the lack of trained staff for women's haircuts on that day.\n\nThe customer was told they needed an appointment, but they insisted they wanted a men's style, which the manager clarifies doesn't change the policy. The staff's discomfort is due to both religious rules and the technical aspects of cutting women's hair. The customer labeled the shop as transphobic and sexist, but the manager is standing by their policy to protect employees and ensure proper service.\n\nNow, considering legal and ethical aspects. In many places, businesses can have policies based on their religious beliefs, as long as they don't discriminate against protected classes. However, if the customer identifies as male, the policy might not apply. But the scenario mentions the customer is a male-passing woman, which might complicate things. If the customer is transgender and presenting as male, the shop's policy could be seen as discriminatory. However, if the customer is a cisgender woman presenting as male, the policy still applies as written.\n\nThe shop's policy is in place to comply with their religious practices, but they do make exceptions by contracting a female stylist when needed. The manager is correct in needing lead time to bring her in. The customer's frustration comes from not getting the service immediately, but the policy is clear. The manager's responsibility includes protecting employees' religious practices and ensuring service quality.\n\nLegally, in some regions, businesses can't refuse service based on gender identity if they're providing a public accommodation. However, religious exemptions might allow certain policies. It's a gray area. Ethically, the shop is transparent about their policy, but refusing service to someone who doesn't fit the policy (even if they're a woman passing as male) could be seen as problematic, especially if the person is transgender. The manager should consider if the policy applies to all genders equally, but the scenario says they serve mostly men and require appointments for women. If the customer is a woman, regardless of presentation, the policy stands. \n\nIn conclusion, the manager isn't in the wrong because the policy is communicated, and they provided a solution (appointment). The customer's accusations might be based on misunderstanding the policy. However, there's a potential ethical issue if the policy is applied in a way that discriminates against transgender individuals. But given the information, the manager followed their stated policy and offered an alternative.\n"
