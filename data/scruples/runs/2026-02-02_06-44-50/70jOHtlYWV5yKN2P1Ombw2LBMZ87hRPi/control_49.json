We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the manager of a barbershop is in the wrong for not cutting a male-passing woman's hair because the shop's policy requires appointments for women and they don't have a female barber available that day. The shop is primarily Muslim, and the policy is based on religious beliefs about not touching women's hair unless it's family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. However, religious exemptions might come into play. The situation here is a bit tricky because the customer identifies as male-passing but requested a men's cut. The shop's policy is clear on appointments for women, but the customer's gender presentation is male. The manager is Muslim, and the policy is rooted in their faith's guidelines.\n\nFrom a religious perspective, the business is following their religious beliefs by not having male employees cut women's hair. But the customer's presentation complicates things. If the customer is transgender or non-binary, the business's policy might not account for that. The customer was told they need an appointment for women, which they weren't willing to do, leading to accusations of transphobia.\n\nLegally, I think the business might be violating anti-discrimination laws. For example, in the U.S., Title VII allows religious exemptions for religious organizations, but a barbershop might not qualify. Also, the customer's gender identity might be protected under state laws. The business's policy is based on gender, but the customer's appearance and self-identification as male could mean they were discriminated against without proper accommodation.\n\nEthically, it's a conflict between religious practices and equal service. The business is protecting their employees' beliefs, but they might be infringing on the customer's rights. The manager might not be in the wrong from a religious standpoint, but legally and ethically, they might be. The fact that they could have arranged an appointment with the female barber if given notice suggests there was a way to accommodate, but the customer refused to wait.\n\nSo, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they failed to accommodate the customer's needs despite being able to provide the service with proper notice. However, if the religious exemption applies, it could go the other way. But in many jurisdictions, religious beliefs don't override anti-discrimination laws in public accommodations. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
