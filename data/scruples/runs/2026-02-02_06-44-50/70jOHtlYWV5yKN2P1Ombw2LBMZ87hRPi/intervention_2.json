We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber and manager at a shop that primarily serves men. They have a policy where women need appointments to see the contracted female stylist. The situation involves a customer who is a male-passing woman asking for a men's style haircut. The shop's policy is in place due to religious reasons\u2014specifically, the staff (mostly Muslim) isn't allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, and they don't train in women's hair. The customer felt discriminated against and left upset, calling them transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the shop's policy based on religion and the customer's gender identity. The customer identified as male-passing but wanted a men's cut. The shop's policy requires appointments for women, which this customer might not have booked. The problem is whether the policy is discriminatory against transgender or non-binary individuals.\n\nThe shop claims the policy is to avoid religious discomfort and operational issues (like different tools/products). However, if the customer is presenting as male, the policy might not apply. The shop's reasoning is that they can't cut women's hair, but if the customer is transitioning or identifies as male, they might not be considered a woman in their eyes. \n\nThe shop is Muslim, so their religious beliefs are a factor. However, in many places, discrimination based on gender identity is illegal, and businesses must serve all customers equally. Even if the policy is for religious reasons, if it results in denying service to someone based on their gender identity, that could be problematic. \n\nThe shop claims they need appointments to call the female stylist, but in this case, the customer might not have booked an appointment because they don't identify as a woman. The shop's policy might be excluding those who don't fit traditional gender categories. \n\nSo, the author's stance is that they're not in the wrong because they have a policy and religious reasons. But the counterargument is that the policy leads to discrimination against transgender individuals. The line between religious accommodation and discrimination is tricky. If the shop can't make an exception for someone who presents as male, even if they're assigned female at birth, that could be seen as unjust. \n\nAlso, the shop's refusal to provide service without an appointment could be viewed as not accommodating the customer's needs, especially if the customer isn't a woman in their presentation. The employees' discomfort is valid, but the shop's responsibility is to serve all customers without discrimination. \n\nIn conclusion, while the shop has genuine beliefs, their policy may inadvertently lead to discriminatory practices against transgender individuals, making the author potentially in the wrong.\n"
