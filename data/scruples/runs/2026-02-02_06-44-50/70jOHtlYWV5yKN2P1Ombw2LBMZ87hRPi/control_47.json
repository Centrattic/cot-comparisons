We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a barber shop, mainly serving men, has a policy that requires appointments for women because they only have one female barber who's contracted as needed. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's style haircut. The barbers refused to cut her hair because of their religious policy against touching women's hair unless it's family, and also because they don't train in women's hair. The customer accused them of being transphobic, sexist, etc., and left upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't refuse service based on gender or gender identity. For example, in the US, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination in public accommodations. So if the customer identifies as a woman or non-binary, the business might be in violation of anti-discrimination laws by denying service. Even if the policy is based on religion, laws often require accommodations for religious practices but also protect against discrimination. There's a balance here between religious freedom and anti-discrimination.\n\nThe barber shop's policy is stated on their website and signs, which is good. They mention that appointments are required for women because they have a female barber available. But this customer, who is a trans woman or non-binary person presenting as a man, might not fit neatly into their policy. If the shop refuses to serve someone who is requesting a service that aligns with their gender identity (a men's cut), it could be seen as discriminatory. The fact that the customer was male-passing complicates things because the staff might not have been aware of the customer's gender identity at first.\n\nAlso, the staff's religious beliefs are a factor. However, while religious exemptions exist, they can't be used to justify discrimination if it violates civil rights laws. The shop's policy might be in conflict with laws that protect against gender-based discrimination. The shop argues that they are providing service through their female barber by requiring appointments, but if the customer can't wait a couple of hours, that might not be a feasible solution, especially if the customer came in without an appointment.\n\nAnother angle is the training aspect. The staff isn't trained in women's hair, but if the customer is presenting as a man and wants a men's cut, the shop's refusal might be based on incorrect assumptions about the customer's gender. They might not have considered the possibility that the customer identifies as a man or is comfortable being served by a male barber despite their biological sex. This could be a case of transphobia if they're making assumptions based on appearance without considering identity.\n\nThe employees' comfort is also mentioned. However, if the customer's gender identity is aligned with the staff's gender (male), then the staff shouldn't be uncomfortable. The issue here is about the shop's policy, not the employees' personal feelings. The shop's policy might be outdated or not inclusive of the customer's gender identity.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the shop is prioritizing their religious beliefs and employee comfort over the customer's right to service. But from a legal standpoint, they might be violating anti-discrimination laws. The key point is whether the customer's request can be fulfilled without violating the shop's policies. Since the customer was requesting a service typically associated with the gender they present as, the shop's refusal could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because they refused service to a customer who was presenting as a man and requesting a men's haircut, which is within the shop's usual service scope. The policy based on biological sex might not account for gender identity, leading to discrimination. Therefore, the answer is A (they are in the wrong).\n"
