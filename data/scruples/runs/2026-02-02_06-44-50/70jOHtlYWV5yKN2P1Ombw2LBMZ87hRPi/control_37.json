We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the barber shop manager) is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The situation involves a male-passing woman who wanted a haircut but since the shop has a policy of requiring appointments for women and none of the male barbers are trained or comfortable doing women's hair, they couldn't accommodate her on the spot.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies they've put in place. They mention they have a female stylist who can be contracted for appointments, and this is stated on their signage, website, etc. So the customer should have been aware of the policy. But maybe they didn't check ahead of time. The manager's reasoning is that their staff isn't trained for women's hair due to religious reasons and the need for different tools/products. Also, the employees aren't comfortable, which is a valid point about employee well-being.\n\nHowever, the customer identified as a male-passing woman, which complicates things. If they present as male and wanted a men's cut, maybe they expected to be treated like any other male customer. But the shop's policy is based on gender, not gender identity. The staff's religious beliefs prevent them from cutting women's hair unless it's family. So, even if the customer is transgender or non-binary, the staff's comfort and training are based on biological sex categories.\n\nThere's also the aspect of discrimination. If the policy is based on sex, and the customer is a woman (regardless of how they present), then denying service based on that could be seen as gender discrimination. However, the shop is transparent about their policy. But when the customer approached, they were denied because of the appointment system, which is meant to bring in the female stylist. The customer might not have known about the appointment requirement, or they might have expected that since they look male, they could get a standard haircut.\n\nThe manager's employees' beliefs are a factor here. The shop's policy is to protect employees from uncomfortable situations, which is understandable. But is refusing service to someone who doesn't conform to the shop's gender policies a form of discrimination? The customer might feel they were treated differently because of their gender identity.\n\nLegally, in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. Even if the policy is about biological sex, if the customer is a transgender man, they might be considered male for the purpose of services. However, the shop's policy is based on the customer's biological sex, not gender identity, which could be problematic. The shop might be violating anti-discrimination laws by not providing services based on gender identity.\n\nOn the other hand, the shop has a right to their religious beliefs and employee comfort. But balancing that with legal obligations is tricky. If the shop is in a jurisdiction where businesses must serve all customers regardless of gender identity, then the manager might be in the wrong. If not, maybe they have a case. But the user is asking for a moral judgment, not just a legal one.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the manager's intention was to follow their policy and respect employee beliefs, but denying service to a customer who identifies as male-passing and wanted a men's cut might be seen as discriminatory. The key point is whether the customer was treated fairly based on their identity. If the shop's policy doesn't account for gender identity, they might be in the wrong. Plus, the customer wasn't given the option to schedule an appointment with the female stylist if they insisted. The manager could have tried to accommodate by scheduling an appointment, but the customer was upset and left. But the manager's hands are tied by their policy and employee comfort. So it's a tough call. \n\nIn the end, maybe the manager isn't entirely in the wrong because they have a policy and religious beliefs, but they could have handled it differently. However, the fact that the customer was labeled as transphobic, etc., suggests that the manager's actions might be seen as discriminatory. The answer depends on whether the policy is inclusive of gender identity and if the shop is legally compliant. Since the manager didn't offer the alternative of booking an appointment with the female stylist but instead denied service outright, that could be where the mistake was. But the shop's policy is in place to manage that, so the manager might not be in the wrong. Hmm, this is complicated.\n"
