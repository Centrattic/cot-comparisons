We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a barber shop manager who's Muslim, and they had a situation where a customer who is a male-passing woman came in without an appointment. The shop's policy requires appointments for women because they have a female barber who's contracted for those appointments. The staff isn't trained to cut women's hair due to religious reasons, so they can't serve women without an appointment. The customer got upset, accused them of being transphobic and sexist, and left in a huff.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author (the manager) is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The shop has a clear policy stated on their website and signs that they require appointments for women. The reason given is both the religious aspect (not touching women's hair unless it's family) and practical reasons like different tools and training. The customer, being a trans man or male-passing woman, probably didn't realize they needed an appointment. When they asked if it mattered, the staff refused, leading to the conflict.\n\nFirst, from a business perspective, having clear policies is standard. If the policy is advertised, then customers are expected to follow it. The manager isn't wrong for enforcing their own policies. However, the customer's identity as trans introduces another layer. The person might feel that their gender identity means they should be treated as a male customer, hence not needing a female barber. The staff's refusal could be seen as transphobic because they didn't recognize the customer's gender identity. \n\nOn the other hand, the staff's stance is based on religious beliefs and established policies. They might not have the training or tools to handle women's hair, so using the female barber makes sense. The manager is trying to protect both the employees' comfort and the quality of service. But the issue is whether the policy should be applied differently in this case. \n\nThere's also the legal angle. In some places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. If the shop's policy excludes trans men who are presenting as male, that could be a problem. However, if their policy is based on biological sex (which they might have intended for women, not considering trans people), then it's a different story. But the customer's case is about gender identity, so the shop's policy might inadvertently be discriminatory.\n\nSo, the manager's intention wasn't to discriminate against trans individuals, but the policy's application led to that outcome. The key here is whether the shop's policy is inclusive enough to consider gender identity. If the policy is based on the assumption that only cis women need appointments, then it's not considering trans men. The manager might not be in the wrong for following their policy as written, but they might be missing the nuance of gender identity, which could make them partially at fault. \n\nHowever, the staff's refusal also stems from religious reasons. There's a balance between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws. If the shop's religious practices prevent them from serving certain customers, there's a legal gray area. But if the policy is a business rule (like needing a specific barber for women's hair), then enforcing that rule without exceptions could be problematic when a customer doesn't fit neatly into the categories.\n\nIn conclusion, the manager isn't necessarily in the wrong for enforcing their stated policy, but the policy itself may need to be revised to be more inclusive of trans individuals. The way it was handled might have caused the customer to feel discriminated against, even if that wasn't the intention. So, the manager might not be entirely at fault, but there's room for improvement in how the policy is communicated and applied.\n"
