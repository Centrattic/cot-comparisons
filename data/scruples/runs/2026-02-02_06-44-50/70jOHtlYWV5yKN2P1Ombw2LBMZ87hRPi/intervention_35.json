We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a barber shop manager, mostly serving men, with a Muslim background. They have a policy that women need appointments because they have a female barber contracted for that. The customer in question was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut but wasn't willing to book an appointment. The staff isn't trained in women's hair due to religious reasons, so they can't serve her without the female stylist. The customer got upset and accused them of being transphobic.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the shop's policy is clear about women needing appointments, which is stated on their website and other platforms. The customer didn't follow the policy, and the staff can't cut women's hair due to religious reasons. The manager is trying to uphold the policy to ensure service quality and employee comfort. The customer's reaction was anger and accusations.\n\nNow, considering discrimination laws. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. If the shop is excluding someone because they are a trans man (male-passing woman), that might be illegal. The policy is for women, but if the customer identifies as a man, they might not be required to book an appointment. The shop's policy might be unintentionally excluding trans men, which could be a problem. Even if the policy is for women, if the customer is presenting as male, the shop might be in the wrong by not serving them under the men's service policy.\n\nAlso, the staff's religious beliefs are a factor. However, in many jurisdictions, religious exemptions don't override anti-discrimination laws. The shop might need to accommodate the customer without violating their beliefs, perhaps by adjusting their policy or finding another way to serve them. But if the policy is rigid and they can't make exceptions, that might lead to legal issues.\n\nThe manager's intention was to follow the policy and protect employees, but if the policy isn't clear on gender identity or if the customer's identity is at odds with the policy, the shop might be violating anti-discrimination laws. The customer's right to service could outweigh the shop's religious convictions in this scenario.\n\nSo, considering all that, the manager might be in the wrong because they refused service to a customer who identifies as male, thus potentially violating anti-discrimination laws. The policy might need to be reviewed to account for gender identity. Therefore, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
