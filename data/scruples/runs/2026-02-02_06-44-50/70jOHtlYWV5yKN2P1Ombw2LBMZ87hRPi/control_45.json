We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a barber shop run by Muslims, and they have a policy where women need appointments because the male barbers aren't allowed to cut women's hair due to religious reasons. There's a female employee who comes in for appointments as needed. \n\nThe customer in question is a male-passing woman who wants a man's style haircut. The barbers explain that they can't do it without an appointment because the woman barber is only available with notice. The customer gets upset, calls them transphobic, sexist, etc., and leaves.\n\nHmm, the question is whether the author (the manager) is at fault. Let's break it down. The barbershop has a policy stated on their website and signs that women need appointments. They can't cut women's hair due to religious beliefs, so they rely on the female barber. The customer is a woman who wants a men's cut, but the barbers can't do it without the female barber. The customer feels they were discriminated against, but the manager is following the shop's policy.\n\nWait, but the customer is a woman who might identify as a woman. The barbershop's policy requires women to book with the female barber. However, the customer argues that since they are male-passing and want a men's cut, maybe they don't want to be treated as a woman. But the shop's policy is based on the customer's gender as per their appointment system. Is it discrimination based on gender identity? The shop's policy might be problematic if they refuse service based on gender identity, but they stated that the female barber is available for women. However, if the customer is female-presenting but identifies as male, but the barbers can't tell, maybe the shop is applying a policy that's based on perceived gender, which could be an issue. \n\nBut in the scenario, the shop's policy is about serving all customers, but their religious beliefs prevent them from cutting women's hair. They have a process to accommodate women with the female barber. The customer is a woman who wants a men's cut but the barbers can't do it because of the religion-based policy. However, the customer might feel that since they are a woman (even if they pass as male) they shouldn't be treated differently. \n\nBut the manager is following the shop's policy, which is clearly stated. The customer was informed beforehand that women need appointments. However, the customer might not have known they were considered female by the shop's criteria. Also, the shop's policy might not account for gender identity, leading to a conflict. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. If the policy is based on perceived gender rather than gender identity, it could be problematic. The shop's religious beliefs are a factor, but if that leads to discrimination against transgender or gender non-conforming individuals, they might be in violation of anti-discrimination laws. \n\nBut the shop is Muslim, and their religion prohibits men from cutting women's hair. However, the customer in question is a woman (as per the shop's policy) and the shop has a system to accommodate that. If the customer is a female-to-male transgender person and they are passing as male, the shop's policy might be ignoring their gender identity. \n\nSo, the manager followed the policy, but the policy might be discriminatory in this case. The shop's policy is based on perceived gender, not gender identity, which could be the issue. Therefore, the manager might be in the wrong because the policy could be considered transphobic if it doesn't take into account the customer's gender identity. Even though they have a female barber, if the shop's policy doesn't allow for the possibility of transgender clients who are women but want a men's cut, they're not accommodating them properly. \n\nAlternatively, if the customer is a cisgender woman who male-passes but is still considered a woman by the shop's policy, then the shop is following their own rules. However, the way the policy is applied might not be inclusive of transgender individuals. \n\nIn conclusion, the manager might be in the wrong if the policy doesn't account for gender identity, leading to discrimination against transgender individuals. The shop's policy is based on perceived gender, which can lead to issues with clients whose gender identity doesn't align with their perceived gender. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
