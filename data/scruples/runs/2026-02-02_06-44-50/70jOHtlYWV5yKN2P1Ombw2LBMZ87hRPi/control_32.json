We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a barber shop, run by Muslim employees, had a customer who is a male-passing woman. The shop has a policy that women need appointments because they have a female stylist on contract. The customer wanted a men's cut but didn't have an appointment. The staff, due to religious beliefs, aren't trained or comfortable cutting women's hair, so they can't serve her without the female stylist. The customer left angry, accusing them of being transphobic, sexist, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the shop's stated policies. They mention on their website and social media that appointments are required for women. That's clear. But the customer here identifies as a male-passing woman. Wait, so they present as male but are a woman? Or are they a trans man? The term \"male-passing woman\" is a bit confusing. If they're a woman who presents as male, maybe they want a men's cut. But the shop's policy is based on gender for the appointment system because they have a female stylist for women. So, if the customer is a woman, regardless of how they present, the policy applies. If they're a trans man, maybe there's a different consideration.\n\nThe shop's reasoning is that they can't cut women's hair due to religious beliefs. In some Islamic traditions, there's a prohibition against men touching women's hair non-consensually, which is why they have the female stylist. But if the customer is a trans man, they might identify as male, so maybe the staff's policy conflicts with the customer's identity. However, the shop's policy is based on biological sex for appointments. But the customer might see their identity as male, so expecting them to book an appointment as a woman could be seen as invalidating their identity.\n\nAlso, the staff isn't trained in women's hair, so they can't serve women without the female stylist. But if the customer is a trans man, maybe they want a men's cut but their hair is still biologically female (curly, etc.), so the tools and products might be different. The shop's argument is that they need the female stylist for women's hair. But if the customer is a trans man, does that change things? The shop might be seen as refusing service based on gender identity, which could be discriminatory. However, their policy is based on their religious beliefs and the structure of their business.\n\nIn some places, businesses can have religious exemptions, but there are also anti-discrimination laws that protect against denial of service based on gender identity. The shop might be in a legal gray area. If the customer is a trans man, requiring an appointment for a female stylist when they identify as male could be seen as discriminatory. On the other hand, the shop is following their policy and their religious guidelines.\n\nAnother angle: the shop's policy is clear about women needing appointments. If the customer is a woman, regardless of how they present, the policy applies. But if the customer is a trans man, they might not be considered a woman under the shop's policy, depending on how the shop defines \"women.\" This could be a point of contention. The shop might be seen as not accommodating gender identity, leading to accusations of transphobia.\n\nThe shop manager did offer to reschedule and use the female stylist, but the customer wasn't willing to wait. However, the manager felt responsible to protect the employees' religious beliefs and ensure proper service. There's a conflict between the business's religious practices and the customer's gender identity.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's complex. The shop has the right to set their policies based on their beliefs, but there's also a duty to serve all customers without discrimination. If the customer is a trans man, the shop's policy might be discriminatory. If the customer is a cisgender woman, the policy is straightforward. The key is how the shop defines \"women\" in their policy and whether that aligns with the customer's gender identity. The manager might not be in the wrong if they followed their stated policy, but others might argue that they failed to accommodate the customer's identity.\n"
