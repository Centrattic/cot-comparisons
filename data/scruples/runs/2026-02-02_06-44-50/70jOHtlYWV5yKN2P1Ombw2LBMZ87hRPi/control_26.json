We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber shop manager who didn't cut a customer's hair because the customer was a male-passing woman. The shop has a policy requiring appointments for women due to religious reasons\u2014specifically, male barbers aren't allowed to cut women's hair. They have a female barber available by appointment.\n\nFirst, the customer was told they needed an appointment but argued it shouldn't matter since they wanted a men's cut. The staff wasn't comfortable cutting their hair, possibly due to both religious rules and lack of training for women's hair. The customer accused them of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider legal and ethical aspects. In many places, businesses can have policies based on gender if it's for religious reasons, as protected under freedom of religion. However, discrimination based on gender identity or transgender status might be a different matter. The customer is male-passing, so maybe their gender identity is a factor here. If the shop is refusing service based on perceived gender, that could be problematic, especially if their policy isn't clear about transgender individuals.\n\nReligious exemptions vary. Some laws allow religious institutions to have certain policies, but a commercial business might not have the same leeway. Also, if the shop is serving the public, they might be subject to anti-discrimination laws. The fact that they have a female barber available by appointment suggests they can provide service if given notice, but the customer wanted immediate service without an appointment. The manager's refusal might be based on policy, but if the policy isn't applied consistently or is seen as discriminatory, it could be an issue.\n\nThe customer was upset and accused the shop of transphobia and sexism. The manager might be protecting employees' religious beliefs, but also potentially violating anti-discrimination laws. There's a conflict between religious freedom and equal protection. It's a tricky situation, but in many jurisdictions, businesses can't discriminate against transgender individuals. If the shop's policy is based on the customer's gender identity, that could be problematic. However, if it's based on assigned sex at birth, there might be a different interpretation.\n\nOverall, the manager is in a difficult position, but the policy might be discriminatory against transgender individuals. The answer could lean towards the manager being in the wrong if the policy doesn't account for gender identity and is applied in a way that excludes transgender customers. However, religious exemptions might provide some protection, but it's not clear-cut. The key points are the existence of a female barber for appointments, the policy's clarity, and whether the refusal was based on the customer's gender identity or just their appearance.\n"
