We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair because they claim the customer is a male-passing woman, and the barbershop has a policy that requires appointments for women, which is due to religious reasons. The barbershop is mostly Muslim, and their policy is based on the Islamic rule that men shouldn't touch women's hair except for family, but women can touch men's hair. So they don't train their male staff to cut women's hair. The customer, who identifies as a man (or is a male-passing woman), wanted a men's haircut but was told they needed an appointment. The customer got upset and called them transphobic, etc. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. If the customer is transgender and identifies as male, then the business might be seen as refusing service based on gender identity, which is illegal in some jurisdictions. The policy is in place for religious reasons, but laws about religious exemptions vary. If the business is allowed to have a policy based on religion, then maybe they're not in the wrong. But if the customer is transgender and the business refuses service, that could be discrimination.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. Even if the policy is based on religion, the business is publicly stating that they serve all customers but have specific rules for women. If the customer is male-passing but identified as a man, the business might have overstepped by not accommodating. The customer might argue that their gender identity is self-identified, and the business shouldn't use their perceived gender as a reason to refuse service.\n\nAlso, the business mentions that they have a female barber available on appointment. If the customer was willing to wait for an appointment, the issue might have been resolved. However, the customer might not have wanted to wait or might not have known about the policy. The business could be seen as not making their policies clear enough, but they do mention that they state the policy on their signs, website, etc. Still, if the policy leads to discrimination against transgender individuals, the business could be at fault.\n\nAnother point is that the staff wasn't trained to cut women's hair due to religious beliefs, but the customer is presenting as male. If the staff is trained to cut men's hair, then maybe they could have proceeded. The business's reasoning is that the customer is a woman, so they can't cut her hair, but if the customer is trans, the business might be making a judgment based on perceived gender rather than self-identification.\n\nIn some regions, businesses are required to accommodate customers regardless of gender identity. So even if the policy is based on religion, it might not override the legal requirement to serve everyone. The business might be violating anti-discrimination laws by refusing service to someone based on their gender identity.\n\nOn the other hand, if the business has a legitimate religious exemption, they might not be in the wrong. But this depends on local laws. For example, in some places, religious exemptions don't cover gender identity, so the business would be in the wrong. In others, they might be allowed to have such policies.\n\nThe customer's accusation of being transphobic is a strong one. If the business is perceived as excluding transgender individuals, that could be seen as discriminatory regardless of the policy. The key is whether the policy is applied based on self-identified gender or perceived gender. If the business uses perceived gender, that could be problematic for transgender people.\n\nIn summary, the business's policy might be based on religious beliefs, but if they refuse service to someone who identifies as a different gender than their perceived one, they could be violating anti-discrimination laws. The answer would depend on local laws regarding religious exemptions versus anti-discrimination protections for transgender individuals. However, in many cases, the business could be seen as in the wrong for not accommodating the customer's gender identity and for potential discrimination.\n"
