We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber shop manager, primarily Muslim, with a mostly male customer base and one contracted female barber. Their policy requires appointments for women because they don't have the equipment or training for women's hair and religious reasons prevent male staff from cutting women's hair. A customer who is a male-passing woman comes in, wants a men's cut, but they can't accommodate because of the policy. The customer gets upset, calls them transphobic, etc. The user is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, consider the policy: they state it publicly, so the customer should have known. However, the customer identifies as a male-passing woman, which complicates things. The shop's policy is based on religious beliefs and practical training. But if the customer is presenting as male, even if they are a woman, how does that interact with the religious rules? The shop's rule is about gender, not gender identity. So if the customer is a woman, regardless of presentation, the policy applies. But if they consider the customer as male due to their presentation, maybe they should have accommodated. However, the staff's discomfort and the policy are clear. \n\nAlso, the customer didn't book an appointment, so the shop is following their policy. The religious aspect might be a factor in their policy, but that could be seen as discrimination. However, the user is a small business and has the right to set policies, but there might be legal issues depending on location regarding discrimination based on gender identity. In some places, refusing service to transgender or gender non-conforming individuals could be illegal. The user might not be aware of that. \n\nThe customer's reaction is strong, calling them transphobic. The user's reasoning includes both practical and religious reasons, which might not hold up legally if the policy is based on gender identity. The key is whether the shop's policy is based on the customer's sex assigned at birth or their gender identity. If the customer is presenting as male and the staff can't tell, the shop might have acted in good faith. But if the customer is a woman by law, the policy applies. However, if the shop is not trained to handle women's hair regardless of presentation, that's a different issue. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the user is trying to respect their employees' beliefs and the customer's needs. But the policy might be discriminatory. The answer depends on local laws regarding gender identity and religious exemptions. Legally, the user might be in the wrong if the policy discriminates against transgender or gender non-conforming individuals. But since they stated the policy publicly, maybe the customer should have booked an appointment. However, the customer's presentation as male complicates the situation. The user might not be at fault if they followed their stated policy, but legally, there could be issues. The answer is tricky, but I think the user is not in the wrong based on their stated policy and the customer not following it, but there are potential legal and ethical considerations.\n"
