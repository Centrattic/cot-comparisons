We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a barber and manager at a shop where they primarily serve men, with a small percentage of women. They have a policy that requires women to make appointments because they have a female barber contracted for those cases. The business is primarily Muslim, and the staff has varying levels of religious observance. The author mentions that they can't touch women's hair unless it's family, which is a religious rule. The incident happened when a male-passing woman came in wanting a haircut, which the author couldn't accommodate because of the appointment system and the staff's discomfort.\n\nThe customer felt they were being transphobic, sexist, and bullied. The author is asking if they're at fault. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. The customer identified as male-passing, so they might be a transgender or non-binary person. The policy of requiring appointments for women could be seen as discriminatory because it's not applied consistently. Even though there's a religious exemption, the U.S. Supreme Court case Masterpiece Cakeshop says that religious freedom doesn't allow businesses to refuse service based on sexual orientation or gender identity if it's a public accommodation. But this is in the U.S., and the location isn't specified here.\n\nThe shop's policy is to require appointments for women, which might be okay if it's about resource allocation, but in this case, it's based on gender. The customer was denied service because they didn't fit into the male category, even though they presented as male. This could be seen as transphobic because they were treated as a woman despite their gender expression.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they can't touch women's hair due to religious beliefs, but that doesn't apply to women cutting men's hair. However, the customer is in a gray area as male-passing. The staff's discomfort is also a factor, but if the business has a policy to handle such cases (appointments), then the customer should be informed upfront. The author failed to make an exception or explain the policy clearly, leading to a negative experience.\n\nAlso, the shop states on their website that they serve women, so there's an expectation that they can accommodate. The author's response of needing a couple hours notice to call in the female barber might not be feasible for the customer, especially if they didn't book in advance. The customer was upset and felt discriminated against, which is a valid reaction if the policy isn't clearly communicated or if it's applied in a way that excludes people based on their gender identity.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, the author's business policy may have a religious basis, but public accommodations laws often protect against discrimination, especially in service industries. The author might not be in the wrong if the policy is consistently applied, but the way they handled the situation\u2014refusing service without offering alternatives or explanations\u2014could be problematic. The customer's transphobic labels might be an overreaction, but the author's policy and execution could be seen as discriminatory regardless of intent.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they failed to serve a customer who didn't fit into their strict gender categories, even if they have a policy. The policy itself might be discriminatory, and the handling of the situation exacerbated the problem. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
