We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author, who is a barber and manager, is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a man's haircut, but the shop's policy requires appointments for women, and they don't cut women's hair unless it's family. The shop is primarily Muslim, and the employees have varying levels of strictness regarding their faith. The customer accused them of being transphobic, sexist, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies the shop has in place. They mention that they require appointments for women because their staff isn't trained in women's hair due to religious reasons, and they have a female stylist on contract for those appointments. The customer in question is a male-passing woman, which complicates things. The customer might not identify as female, but the shop's policy is based on gender. So, if the customer presented as male but is legally or self-identifying as female, the shop's policy might not apply. But if the shop's policy is based on appearance or self-identification, then maybe they have a right to apply the appointment system.\n\nBut the main issue here is that the customer wanted a men's haircut, so maybe they don't want to be treated as a woman in this context. The shop's reasoning is that their staff isn't trained in women's hair, which could lead to a subpar service. However, the customer is arguing that they are a man (even if they are a trans man or non-binary person), so the policy shouldn't apply. The shop's policy might be discriminatory if it's based on gender identity or expression, especially if the customer is asking for a men's cut. \n\nAlso, the shop's policy about not cutting women's hair unless it's family is rooted in their religion. But in many places, businesses can't refuse service based on gender identity or discrimination, especially if it's not a religious exemption. However, there are some cases where religious accommodations are allowed, but it's a gray area. The shop might believe they have a right to their policy, but the customer feels discriminated against.\n\nThe author mentioned that they tried to explain the policy and that they could call in the female stylist with a couple of hours' notice, but the customer didn't accept that. The author felt bad but had to consider employees' comfort and service quality. However, refusing service based on gender identity could be seen as discriminatory, even if the policy is based on religion. \n\nSo, the key points are: the shop's policy is in place due to religious beliefs and training limitations, but the customer felt it was transphobic and sexist. The law might vary by location, but generally, discrimination based on gender identity is prohibited. The shop's policy might not account for customers who are transgender or non-binary, leading to the conflict. Therefore, the author's refusal could be seen as wrong because it's discriminatory, even if they have a policy. The answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't accommodate the customer's request despite the possibility of providing a men's cut, which the customer was asking for.\n"
