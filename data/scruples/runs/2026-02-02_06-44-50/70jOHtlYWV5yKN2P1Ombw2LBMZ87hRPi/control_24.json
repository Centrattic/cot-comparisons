We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber and manager at a shop that's mostly Muslim. They have a policy where women need appointments because they only have one female stylist who's contracted. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut, but the staff couldn't do it due to religious reasons\u2014specifically, the belief that men shouldn't touch women's hair unless family. The shop doesn't train on women's hair because of that.\n\nSo, the customer got upset, called them transphobic, etc., and left. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the policy is clear: appointments for women only. The customer might not have known this, but the shop advertised it everywhere. The issue is the customer identifying as a male-passing woman. If the customer presented as male, maybe they didn't realize the policy was for women. However, if their gender expression was such that they were perceived as male, maybe the staff couldn't tell. But the shop's policy is based on biological sex, not gender identity, since their reasoning is religious and about hair texture, tools, etc.\n\nBut here's the catch: the customer is a trans man. In many places, discrimination based on gender identity is illegal. Even if the shop's policy is based on religion, they might still be violating anti-discrimination laws. The shop is allowing a policy that could exclude transgender individuals, which could be seen as discriminatory regardless of the stated reasons.\n\nAlso, the shop's policy is to require appointments for women, which is meant to ensure that women are served by the female stylist. But if the customer is a trans man, they might be seeking the same service as any other male customer. The shop's refusal could be seen as transphobic because they're not accommodating based on gender identity.\n\nThe staff's discomfort is also a factor. They don't train in women's hair, so the shop can't provide the service even if they wanted to. But the key point is whether the shop is allowed to enforce a policy that excludes transgender people. Even if they have a female stylist, if the customer is a trans man who identifies as male, the shop might be obligated to serve them under non-discrimination policies.\n\nAdditionally, the customer was told they had to wait a couple of hours for the female stylist. If the shop's policy is that only the female stylist can cut women's hair, but the customer is a trans man, then the shop is not providing equal service. This could be a legal issue because businesses are generally required to serve all customers regardless of gender identity.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, religious exemptions might not apply in cases of discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals. So, the shop's religious reasons might not be a valid defense here. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for enforcing a policy that discriminated against a transgender customer, even if the policy was intended to avoid violating religious beliefs.\n"
