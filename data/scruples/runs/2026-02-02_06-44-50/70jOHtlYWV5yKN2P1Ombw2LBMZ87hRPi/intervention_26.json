We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a manager at a Muslim barbershop that mainly serves men. They have a policy that women need appointments because the shop has a female stylist who's contracted for those. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut but wasn't making an appointment. The staff didn't feel comfortable cutting women's hair due to religious reasons, so they refused. The customer accused them of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies in place. The shop clearly states on their website and signage that appointments are required for women. That's their policy, so the author isn't necessarily violating any internal rules. The reason for the policy is both religious (not allowing male employees to touch women's hair unless family) and practical (different tools/products for women). The author mentions that the female contractor isn't available on the day in question.\n\nThe customer might feel discriminated against because they identified as a woman but present as male and wanted a men's cut. If they had made an appointment, perhaps the female stylist could have handled it. But they didn't, and the shop can't just switch their policy on the spot. However, the customer might not have known about the appointment system or the religious restrictions. \n\nNow, considering legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or sexual orientation. By having a policy that requires women to book appointments only with the female stylist, are they inadvertently excluding non-binary or transgender customers? The customer here is a male-passing woman, which complicates things. If the shop's policy is based on gender, but the customer doesn't fit neatly into that category, there might be a problem. \n\nAlso, the shop's policy is rooted in religious beliefs, which might be protected under anti-discrimination laws, but there's a balance between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws. However, if the policy is applied in a way that excludes protected classes, the shop could be at risk. \n\nThe key points are: the policy is publicized, the staff's discomfort is based on religion, and the customer was denied service without an appointment. The author is trying to protect both employees' comfort and the quality of service. But the customer's reaction suggests they felt targeted. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the shop's policy is clear and the customer didn't follow it, then maybe not. But if the policy itself is discriminatory, then yes. The issue is whether the policy is fair and not excluding people based on protected characteristics. Since the customer is a woman who presents as male, the shop's policy might not account for that, leading to a possible oversight. \n\nAlso, the fact that the shop requires appointments for women regardless of their gender expression could be problematic. The customer might not have identified as female in a way that the shop recognized, so the policy might not be inclusive. \n\nIn terms of transphobia, the shop's policy is based on the customer's gender as per their own identification. If the customer identified as a woman and wanted a men's cut, but the shop requires appointments for women, there's a conflict. However, the shop's policy is to serve women through the female stylist, which is a separate issue. \n\nI need to consider if the shop's policy is inclusive. If the customer is a woman (as they identify) but presents as male, the shop's policy might not be accommodating enough. The shop might be seen as not respecting the customer's gender identity by not allowing a male stylist to cut their hair if they present as male. \n\nIn the end, the author's stance is based on religious and practical reasons, but the customer's perspective is about accessibility and non-discrimination. It's a tough call, but if the policy is rigid and doesn't account for gender diversity, the author might be in the wrong. Alternatively, if the policy is clearly communicated and the customer didn't comply, the author is in the right. But given the customer's identity and the potential for discrimination, there's a case for the author being wrong.\n"
