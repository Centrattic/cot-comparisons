We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the manager of a barbershop is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's style haircut. The shop's policy requires appointments for women because they have a female barber on contract, and the staff isn't trained for women's hair due to religious reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the shop's policies. They clearly state on their website and signage that they have a female barber for women. So, the customer might not have known about the policy. The manager explains that the staff isn't trained for women's hair, which is because of their religion. But wait, isn't that a bit discriminatory? Like, refusing service based on gender could be a problem, especially if the customer is willing to be served by any barber if possible.\n\nThe customer was a male-passing woman, so maybe they expected to be treated like a male customer. The manager says they couldn't serve her because of the appointment system and staff training. But if the staff isn't trained for women's hair, but the customer is presenting as male, does that matter? The texture and tools part is a bit confusing. Maybe the staff isn't trained in women's hair regardless of the customer's gender identity.\n\nThe customer accused the shop of being transphobic and sexist. The manager is Muslim, and their religion influences their policy. In some Islamic teachings, there are guidelines about interactions between genders and certain professions, but not sure if that applies here. However, discrimination based on gender or gender identity is a legal and ethical issue in many places. Even if the policy is based on religion, it might not override the need to serve all customers, especially if the customer isn't a woman in the eyes of the shop.\n\nAlso, the shop says they serve all sorts of customers, so maybe they should consider adjusting their policy to be more inclusive. The fact that they could have called in the female barber with a couple of hours notice suggests that the refusal was more about policy than actual inability to provide service. The customer might not have known about the appointment system, so the manager's responsibility is to inform them properly, not just refuse.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the manager's policy might be leading to discrimination against non-binary or transgender customers. Even if the policy is in place for religious reasons, the shop should find a way to accommodate all customers without violating their beliefs. Maybe they can clarify their policies better or make exceptions when possible. Therefore, the manager might be in the wrong here.\n"
