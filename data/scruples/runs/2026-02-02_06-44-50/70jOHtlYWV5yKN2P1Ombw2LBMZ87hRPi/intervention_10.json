We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a manager at a barbershop that primarily serves men. They mention that they have a policy requiring appointments for women so that the contracted female stylist can be called in. The situation involves a customer who is a male-passing woman (trans woman?) who wanted a men's style haircut. The barbershop's policy is based on religious reasons, as the staff is mostly Muslim and they don't cut women's hair unless it's family, but the female stylist is contracted for women.\n\nSo, the customer didn't book an appointment, and when they asked if it's okay, the shop refused, leading to accusations of transphobia, sexism, etc. The manager says they have to consider employees' comfort and the different tools/products needed. They also mention that the female stylist isn't there that day.\n\nFirst, the key issue is whether the refusal to cut the customer's hair was justified. The shop's policy is clear: appointments for women, which allows them to bring in the contracted stylist. The customer identified as male-passing but wanted a men's cut. However, the staff's religious beliefs prevent them from cutting women's hair. The problem is the customer's gender identity here. If the customer is a trans woman, but presents as male, does the shop's policy based on biological sex apply? \n\nIn many places, discrimination based on gender identity is prohibited. If the shop's policy only allows women to get haircuts via appointments, but the customer is a trans woman, refusing based on their assigned sex at birth might not be legally acceptable. Also, the shop's policy might be seen as excluding trans women who are presenting as male. The shop's reasoning is about the female stylist's availability, but if the customer is male-passing, maybe they should have been accommodated as a male customer. \n\nThe shop's policy is clear, but if the customer didn't know that they could book an appointment for women, maybe the shop didn't communicate it effectively. However, the shop explicitly states on their website, etc., that women need appointments. The customer might not have known that their gender identity affects this policy. \n\nAnother angle: the shop's religious beliefs might be a defense, but in many jurisdictions, religious exemptions don't override anti-discrimination laws, especially in public services like haircuts. Also, the shop is offering a service (haircuts) and setting conditions (appointments for women), but if the customer's gender identity is at odds with the policy, it could be seen as discriminatory. \n\nThe employees' comfort is a factor, but the shop's responsibility to serve all customers includes making reasonable accommodations. If they have a contracted stylist for women, they should be able to adjust for trans women who are women in gender identity, even if they present as male. \n\nSo, the manager might be in the wrong for enforcing a policy that excludes trans women based on their gender identity, especially when the policy is based on outdated or discriminatory reasons. The shop's refusal could be seen as transphobic and sexist, even if their intention was to follow religious guidelines. In many places, businesses can't refuse service based on gender identity, regardless of internal policies or religious beliefs.\n"
