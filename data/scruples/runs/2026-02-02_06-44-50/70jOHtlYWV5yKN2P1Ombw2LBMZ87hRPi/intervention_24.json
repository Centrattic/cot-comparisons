We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a barber and manager in a shop that primarily serves men. They mention that they have a policy requiring appointments for women because they have a female barber who contracts part-time. The shop is primarily Muslim, and the religious beliefs affect their policies regarding women's haircuts. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a man's style haircut without an appointment. The staff felt uncomfortable cutting her hair due to religious reasons and lack of training. The customer accused them of transphobia, sexism, etc., and left upset.\n\nFirst, the business has a stated policy. They mention their services and appointment system for women on their website and signage. That's transparency. However, the customer identified as a male-passing woman wanting a men's cut, which might complicate the policy. The key issue is whether the business's policy discriminates against transgender or gender non-conforming individuals. \n\nThe shop's policy is based on religious beliefs and operational reasons (like different tools and training). But in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression under anti-discrimination laws. Even if the policy is for women, if the customer is presenting as male or identifies as male, they might fall outside the policy. However, if the policy is based on biological sex, then a male-passing woman might still be considered under the women's policy. \n\nThe staff's discomfort due to religious beliefs versus the customer's right to service is a conflict here. The shop is providing a service, and if they can't serve someone without violating their beliefs or laws, that's a problem. The customer might feel their gender identity isn't respected, especially if the shop's policy is based on traditional gender roles. \n\nThe business is asking if they're in the wrong. If the customer is trans or non-binary, refusing service could be discriminatory. The shop's policy might not account for gender diversity. Even if they state their policies clearly, there's a gap in how they handle customers who don't fit neatly into male or female categories. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong if the policy is strictly for women as defined by biological sex, but if the customer is male-identifying, then denying service based on a policy meant for women could be problematic. The religious aspect is a defense, but in many jurisdictions, religious exemptions don't override non-discrimination laws, especially in public accommodations. \n\nThe staff's lack of training for women's hair is a business reason, but if the customer is seeking a men's cut, maybe they could have accommodated. However, the staff's discomfort due to religious reasons complicates that. The shop's responsibility is to provide service without discrimination, which includes gender identity and expression. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong if their policy doesn't accommodate gender diversity, leading to discrimination against trans or non-binary individuals. The business's stated policies are clear, but they may not account for all cases, especially those that challenge traditional gender norms. The answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because of potential discrimination against gender non-conforming customers, even if the policy was intended for women.\n"
