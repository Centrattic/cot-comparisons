We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is a manager in a mainly Muslim barbershop that serves men, with one contracted female barber for women. They got a customer who is a male-passing woman wanting a male-style haircut. The shop's policy requires appointments for women, as men barbers can't touch women's hair due to religious reasons. The customer was upset, called them transphobic, etc., and left. The manager is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the key points here are religion and policy. The shop's policy is based on Islamic guidelines that prohibit non-mahram men from touching women, which is a significant part of their practice. They have a female barber available by appointment. The customer, however, identifies as a woman who presents as male and wanted a men's cut. The shop's stance is that they can't serve women except through the female barber, regardless of the customer's appearance. \n\nBut here's the complication: the customer is a woman (in terms of gender) but presenting as male. If the shop's policy is based on the customer's gender, not their appearance, then they should still require the female barber. However, if the policy is based solely on appearance (since they serve 99% men), they might be missing the individual's actual gender. The customer's frustration might stem from being denied service based on perceived gender rather than actual identity. \n\nThe shop states that they don't train in women's hair due to religion, which is their right. But if the customer is a woman, even if passing as male, the policy would still apply. However, if the customer is non-binary or transgender, the situation could be different. The user's explanation isn't entirely clear on the customer's exact identity. They mention \"male-passing woman,\" so the customer is biologically female but presents as male. \n\nThe shop's policy is to require appointments for women, so in this case, the customer is a woman, hence needing the female barber. The manager's reasoning is that they can't serve her unless the female barber is there. The customer was upset, thinking it's transphobic. But if the policy is based on the customer's gender (as assigned at birth), and they are a cisgender woman, then the shop is following their policy. However, if the customer is a trans man, the policy might be problematic because he would prefer to be considered a man, but the shop is treating him as a woman due to religious beliefs.\n\nThe question is whether the shop is in the wrong. If the policy is based on the customer's assigned gender at birth, regardless of their appearance or identity, then they are following their stated policy. However, if the customer identifies as male, the shop's policy might be infringing on their rights. But the shop also has the right to their religious practices. However, in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. So if the customer is a trans man, the shop's policy could be seen as discriminatory. \n\nBut the user says the customer was a \"male-passing woman,\" which suggests they are biologically female but present as male. If the shop requires appointments for women, then regardless of their appearance, they need to follow policy. However, if the shop is denying service based on perceived gender without considering identity, that could be an issue. \n\nAnother angle: the shop's policy is clear on appointments for women. If the customer is a woman, they need to book with the female barber. The problem arises if the customer is not being served because of their gender identity, but in this case, the policy is based on the customer's gender (biological or assigned), not identity. The shop might have a right to their policy, but if the customer is a woman, the policy is correct. However, if the customer is a trans man, the shop's policy might be discriminatory. \n\nThe manager is caught between religious practice and potential discrimination. In some places, religious exemptions allow businesses to refuse service based on faith, but in others, anti-discrimination laws protect against gender identity. It's a complex area. The answer might depend on local laws, but since it's not specified, we have to consider general principles. \n\nThe user's situation is that the customer was denied service because they're a woman (biologically) who presents as male. The shop has a policy requiring appointments for women. The manager followed the policy by not cutting her hair. The customer is upset, calling them transphobic. If the customer is a trans man, the shop's policy is based on their assigned gender, which might not align with their identity. However, the shop's policy is clear and stated on all platforms. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the shop is following their policy as stated and the customer is a woman (biologically), then they are not in the wrong. However, if the customer is a trans man, the shop might be in the wrong by denying service based on assigned gender. But the user's description says \"male-passing woman,\" which implies the customer is a woman. \n\nTherefore, if the customer is a cisgender woman, the shop is not in the wrong for following their policy. If the customer is a trans man, the shop might be in the wrong for not accommodating their identity. Since the user describes the customer as a \"male-passing woman,\" it's likely the customer is a cis woman. Hence, the shop's policy is correct, and they're not in the wrong. However, if the shop's policy is based on appearance rather than identity, that could be an issue. The user mentions they serve 99% men, so they might rely on appearance, but if the customer is a woman, the policy should apply. \n\nIn conclusion, the manager followed the shop's stated policy, which is based on the customer's gender. If the customer is indeed a woman, the manager isn't in the wrong. If the policy is based on gender identity, it might be different, but the user's description suggests it's based on biological gender. Therefore, the answer is B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
