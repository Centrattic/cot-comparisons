We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The author is a barber and manager at a shop where most customers are men. They have a policy requiring appointments for women because they only have a contracted female barber. The shop is primarily Muslim, and the staff have varying levels of religious observance. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut. The author refused to cut her hair because of the appointment policy and religious rules about touching women's hair unless it's family.\n\nThe user argues that the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The shop's policy is clear about appointments for women, stated on their website and signage. The customer might not have checked these details. The shop's refusal is based on religious beliefs and operational policy, not necessarily transphobia or sexism. However, the customer felt discriminated against, thinking the shop was transphobic. The key points are: the policy is in place due to staffing and religious reasons, and the customer didn't follow the appointment system. The shop isn't refusing service based on gender identity but on the appointment policy and religious guidelines. They did offer to accommodate with a few hours notice. The customer's reaction was hostile, but the shop's stance is based on their established rules. So, the author might not be in the wrong as they followed their policy and provided an alternative solution. The answer is B.\n"
