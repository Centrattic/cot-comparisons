We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the barber who didn't cut a customer's hair) is in the wrong. The situation involves a male-passing woman who wanted a haircut but the shop has a policy requiring appointments for women because of religious reasons and the lack of female staff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The shop is primarily Muslim, and there's a religious rule that male staff can't cut women's hair unless it's family. The shop has a policy to handle women's appointments by calling in the female contractor. The customer, who is a woman presenting as male, wanted a men's cut but wasn't booked for an appointment. The staff felt uncomfortable cutting their hair due to the religious guidelines and the fact they aren't trained for women's hair. The customer accused the shop of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the refusal to serve the customer based on their gender identity and the shop's policies is discriminatory. The shop claims they can't serve women due to religious beliefs, but the customer is a woman presenting as male. The shop's policy is clear about appointments for women, so if the customer didn't book an appointment, maybe they were violating their own policy. But the customer's gender identity complicates things. If the customer is a woman (regardless of how they present), then the shop's policy would apply, and they need to be scheduled with the female barber. However, if the shop is refusing based on the customer's gender identity rather than their actual gender, that could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle is the legal aspect. In many places, discrimination based on gender identity is illegal, even if it's under the guise of religious belief. The shop's policy might be seen as discriminatory if it's preventing someone from being served based on their gender identity. Also, the shop's sign and website stating they serve men only could be contributing to confusion. If someone comes in as a woman (even if they pass as male), the shop might be obligated to serve them if they can't make an appointment, especially if the policy isn't clearly communicated.\n\nThe employees' comfort is also a factor. The shop mentions that none of the staff were comfortable cutting the customer's hair due to religious reasons. However, if the customer is a woman, the male employees shouldn't be cutting their hair regardless of their comfort level, according to the shop's policy. The problem arises when the customer's gender identity is in question. If the shop's policy is based on the customer's legal gender or the gender they identify as, that could affect the situation.\n\nThe customer's reaction of being called transphobic and sexist might be valid if the shop refused service because they perceived the customer as male but the actual gender is female. However, if the customer is a woman who identifies as non-binary and presents as male, the shop's refusal might still be discriminatory. The shop's policy is for women, so if the customer is a woman, they should be served through the appointment system. If the shop refused because they didn't believe the customer was a woman, that's another issue. But if they refused based on gender identity, that's more problematic.\n\nIn the end, the key points are whether the shop's policy is applied fairly regardless of the customer's presentation, and whether the refusal was based on the customer's gender identity rather than their legal gender. If the shop's policy is to serve women through appointments and the customer is a woman, then the shop is in the wrong for refusing service. If the customer is not a woman, then the policy stands. However, the way the shop handles gender identity might lead to discrimination claims if they're not consistent or if they're using religious beliefs to deny service to someone based on their identity.\n"
