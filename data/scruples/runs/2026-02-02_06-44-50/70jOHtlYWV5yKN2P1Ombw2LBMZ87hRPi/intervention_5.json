We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author (a barber shop manager) is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut, but the shop has a policy requiring appointments for women because they don't train on women's hair due to religious reasons. The manager explains that their staff isn't comfortable cutting women's hair, and they need to call in the female barber for appointments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The shop's policy is clear on their website and signage, which is important. They state that appointments are required for women. The customer might not have known this, but the policy was publicly available. The reason for the policy is religious, as their staff (mostly Muslim) can't cut women's hair unless it's family. The female barber is contracted on an appointment basis. \n\nThe customer identified as male-passing, so they might not have realized they were being categorized as a woman for the shop's policy. The manager tried to explain that the appointment system is for the staff's comfort and service quality, but the customer felt it was transphobic and sexist. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, businesses can have certain policies, but they can't discriminate based on gender or gender identity in many places. However, the shop's reasoning is religious, which might intersect with religious freedom. There's a balance between anti-discrimination laws and religious exemptions. \n\nThe manager's perspective is about protecting employees' religious beliefs and ensuring proper service. The customer's perspective is about being denied service based on gender identity. If the shop's policy is based solely on gender, even if the customer presents as male, that could be problematic. However, if the shop's policy is based on biological sex (as per their stated appointment for women), then maybe the customer's situation doesn't fit that, but the customer might identify as a woman. \n\nThe shop's policy might be discriminatory if it's based on gender identity versus biological sex. Also, the manager mentions that the female barber isn't available that day, so even if they wanted to accommodate, they couldn't. However, the customer could argue that the shop should make exceptions if they can provide the service. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the manager is trying to respect employees' religious convictions but might be failing to serve all customers equally. The customer might feel they were unfairly judged based on their gender expression. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the shop's policy is discriminatory. If the policy is based on biological sex and the customer is a trans man (assigned female at birth but identifies as male), the shop might still require the female barber, which could be seen as transphobic. Alternatively, if the customer's appearance is such that they pass as male, perhaps the shop's policy wasn't clear enough. \n\nBut the shop's policy is public, so they can't be expected to accommodate everyone outside their stated hours or policies. However, if the customer's gender identity is the issue, then the policy might be problematic. \n\nConsidering all that, the manager might be in the wrong if the policy discriminates against transgender individuals, as they are still people who need services. Even with religious exemptions, many places prioritize anti-discrimination laws. Therefore, the manager might be in the wrong.\n"
