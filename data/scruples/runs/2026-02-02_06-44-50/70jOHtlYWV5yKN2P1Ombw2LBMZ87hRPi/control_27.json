We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber and manager who didn't cut a customer's hair because they were a male-passing woman. They had a policy that women need appointments, and their staff isn't trained for women's hair due to religious reasons. The customer got upset and accused them of being transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, the policy about appointments is stated publicly. The customer may not have read the signs, but the shop made their rules clear. However, the customer identified as male-passing, so maybe they expected a men's cut. The shop's policy is about gender, not identity. The staff's religious beliefs prevent them from cutting women's hair unless it's family, which complicates things. \n\nBut transgender or non-binary individuals may not fit neatly into these categories. The shop's reasoning for requiring appointments (different tools/products) is practical, but maybe there's a way to accommodate without violating beliefs. The key issue is whether the shop's policy discriminates based on gender identity. \n\nPublic policy in some places may require serving all people regardless of gender identity. The shop's refusal could be seen as discriminatory. Also, the customer's gender identity might not align with the shop's policy, making the situation more about transphobia. Even if the shop has stated policies, enforcing them in a way that excludes transgender individuals could be problematic. The manager might not be in the wrong if they followed their policy, but the policy itself could be discriminatory. So the answer is A.\n"
