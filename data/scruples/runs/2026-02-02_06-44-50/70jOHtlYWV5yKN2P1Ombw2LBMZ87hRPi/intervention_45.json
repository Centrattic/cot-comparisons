We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a barber who didn't cut a customer's hair because they're a male-passing woman, and their shop policy requires appointments for women. The customer accused them of being transphobic and sexist. The author of the story is the manager, and they explain that their reason is both religious (not touching women's hair unless family) and practical (different tools/products needed). They also mention they have a female barber available by appointment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. The customer here is a male-passing woman, so she might identify as a woman. By refusing service, the barbershop could be seen as discriminating against her gender identity. Even if their policy is for women, if the customer is a woman, they can't legally deny service. They should probably update their policy to account for gender identity rather than just biological sex.\n\nReligious exemptions are tricky. Some argue they should allow discrimination, but others say businesses can't use religion to deny services to marginalized groups. The barbershop's reasoning is partly religious, but the practical aspect (different tools) feels like a secondary reason. They do have a female barber, so they can accommodate women if given notice. The issue is that the customer didn't make an appointment and was refused on the spot. The manager's policy might not be inclusive enough. Even if they have to adjust their procedures, they should comply with anti-discrimination laws.\n\nAlso, the customer's experience is important. Being told they can't get a haircut because of their gender identity could be hurtful. The barbershop's stance might be well-intentioned because of their faith, but it's not aligning with societal expectations regarding inclusivity and non-discrimination. They might need to revisit their policies to be more inclusive, perhaps by allowing transgender women to be served by male barbers if they present as such, or adjusting their appointment system to be more flexible.\n\nIn conclusion, while the barbershop's policy is based on religious beliefs and practical reasons, it's likely that they are in the wrong because they denied service to a customer based on gender identity, which is a protected category in many jurisdictions. They should adjust their policies to avoid discrimination and ensure all customers are treated fairly.\n"
