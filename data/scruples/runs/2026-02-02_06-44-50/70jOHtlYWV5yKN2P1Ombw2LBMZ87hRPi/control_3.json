We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a barber shop manager who's asking if they're in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The customer was a male-passing woman who didn't have an appointment. The shop has a policy requiring appointments for women because they don't have female staff available unless it's an appointment. The reason given is religious, as the staff is mostly Muslim and there's a rule about not cutting women's hair unless it's family. The customer got upset, called them transphobic and sexist, and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies and whether they're discriminatory. The shop states upfront on their website and signs that they primarily serve men and use a female stylist for women. So the customer had prior knowledge of this policy. The issue is that the customer identified as male-passing but wanted a men's cut without an appointment. The shop's policy is based on their religious beliefs and staff training, which might limit their ability to serve women. \n\nNow, the question is if this policy is discriminatory. If the policy is clear and the customer chose to come in without an appointment, the shop isn't in the wrong. However, if the customer's gender identity complicates things, maybe the shop's policy could be seen as excluding them. But the shop isn't refusing service based on gender identity; they're following a religious policy that's stated publicly. They also mention that the female stylist isn't available on the day, which is why they can't serve. \n\nBut there's a potential conflict here. If the customer is male-passing, maybe they should be served under men's services. However, the staff's religious beliefs prevent them from cutting women's hair, and the customer's gender isn't clear. The shop might not know if the customer is a trans man or a cis woman presenting as male. If the shop's policy is based strictly on biological sex, but the customer identifies as male, there's a misunderstanding. \n\nHowever, the shop's policy is clear and they have a process for appointments. The customer didn't follow it, so the shop isn't at fault. They also tried to explain the situation. The customer's upset reaction might be because they didn't read the policy or didn't want to make an appointment. The shop can't force staff to violate their religious beliefs, so they're protecting their employees' comfort. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical aspects, the shop's policy is public, so it's their right to set terms. The customer is responsible for adhering to those terms. The shop isn't refusing service to a trans person; they're following a policy that's in place for all women. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
