We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to unpack this situation. The user is a barber and manager of a shop where most customers are men. They have a policy that requires women to make appointments, which is stated on their website and social media. They have a woman barber who works on a contract basis. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut. The shop's policy is that male staff can't cut women's hair due to religious reasons, so they need appointments for women to bring in the female barber. But the customer refused to make an appointment and left angry, accusing them of being transphobic, sexist, etc.\n\nFirst, the shop's policy is clear and publicly stated. They mention that they handle women's hair through appointments, which is their way of complying with their religious beliefs. The customer didn't make an appointment, so they couldn't provide service. The problem is whether refusing service to a trans woman under the guise of religious policy is acceptable.\n\nThe key points here are the shop's religious practices and the customer's gender identity. The shop's policy is based on their faith, which prohibits male staff from cutting women's hair. However, the customer identifies as a woman but presents as male. The shop might be conflating gender presentation with the religious rule. If the customer is a trans woman, their gender identity is female, but their physical presentation might not align. The shop's policy is about the biological sex of the client, but the customer's situation is more complex.\n\nThe shop's argument is that they can't touch women's hair due to religious reasons, hence the appointment system. But the customer, who is a trans woman, might not agree with being categorized under the same policy as cisgender women. Also, the shop's policy doesn't train staff on women's hair, which affects the quality of service if they tried to accommodate without the female barber.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. Even if the policy is based on religion, there might be anti-discrimination laws that require accommodations. The shop could be seen as refusing service to a trans woman, which might be illegal. However, religious exemptions vary by jurisdiction. If the location where the shop is located allows religious-based exemptions, then maybe the shop isn't in the wrong. But if the law requires equal service regardless of gender identity, then they are in the wrong.\n\nThe customer's anger stems from feeling excluded and possibly being misgendered. Even if the shop followed their policy, the way they communicated it might have been insensitive. The shop could have offered to reschedule or explained their policy more clearly. But the core issue is whether enforcing such a policy is discriminatory.\n\nIn summary, the shop's policy is based on religious beliefs, but failing to accommodate a trans woman might be considered discrimination. The answer might depend on local laws regarding religious exemptions versus anti-discrimination protections for the LGBTQ+ community. But since the user is asking for a general answer without specific jurisdiction details, it's a bit tricky. However, in many modern contexts, businesses are expected to serve all customers regardless of gender identity, so the shop might be in the wrong.\n"
