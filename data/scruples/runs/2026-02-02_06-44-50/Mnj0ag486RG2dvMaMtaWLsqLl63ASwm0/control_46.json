I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who is not overweight, calls themselves fat, and their overweight friend gets upset. The friend feels that hearing the author talk about their own weight makes her feel bad about herself, since she needs to lose 70 pounds.\n\nHmm. The author is trying to explain that their comments are about their own insecurities and not about the friend. But the friend is clearly hurt by it. So the question is, is the author in the wrong?\n\nFirst, the author is talking about their own body image, which is a personal issue. They aren't directly criticizing the friend, but the friend interprets it as a comparison. Even if the author's intention is to vent their own insecurities, the effect on the friend is negative. The friend is sensitive about her own weight and the author's comments trigger her self-consciousness.\n\nI think this is a case where the impact matters more than the intention. The author might not have meant to hurt the friend, but their words did cause discomfort. The friend asked them not to talk about their weight in front of her, and the author initially agreed. Now they're questioning whether that was unfair. \n\nSo, even though the author isn't directly blaming the friend, the act of discussing their own body in a way that makes the friend feel self-conscious could be seen as insensitive. The author should consider the friend's feelings and respect her boundaries. If the friend feels that the author's comments are making her uncomfortable, then the author is in the wrong for continuing to make those comments despite knowing the effect.\n\nBut wait, the author is also dealing with their own insecurities. That's understandable, but maybe they need to find a different way to express that without hurting their friend. So the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because their actions caused harm, even if unintentionally.\n"
