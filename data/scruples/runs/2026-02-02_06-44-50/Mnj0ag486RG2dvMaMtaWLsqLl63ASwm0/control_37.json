I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who isn't overweight, calls themselves fat in front of their overweight friend. The friend gets upset because she's trying to lose weight and feels that the author's comments make her self-conscious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 125 lbs and acknowledges they're not overweight. They have insecurities but are talking about themselves. The friend, who is in a plus-size category, finds it uncomfortable when the author criticizes their own body. The friend explains that she's trying to lose 70+ pounds and that hearing the author talk that way makes her wonder what the author thinks of her.\n\nThe author says they agreed not to talk about it anymore but now think it's unfair. The question is whether the author was rude by talking about their own body in this way. \n\nOn one hand, the author is just expressing their own insecurities, which are common. But on the other hand, the friend is in a sensitive position where body image issues are affecting her. Even though the author isn't criticizing the friend's body, the friend might feel that such comments create a negative environment around body image, making her own struggles harder. \n\nIt's possible that the author didn't intend to hurt their friend, but the impact is there. The friend specifically asked them to stop, which shows that their words have an effect. The author's argument is that it's about themselves, but the friend's reaction indicates that it's affecting her. So maybe the author should consider the friend's feelings and respect her request, even if they don't fully agree. \n\nHowever, the author might not be in the wrong in terms of intent. They were just talking about their own body. But the reality is that such comments can be hurtful to others, especially those with their own body image issues. So while the author might not have ill intentions, their actions still caused discomfort. The key here is whether the author should have been aware of how their comments might affect the friend. \n\nIn some cases, people might not realize the impact of their words. But since the friend has already expressed that it's a trigger for her, the author should probably comply with the request to avoid causing further discomfort. So, even if the author thinks it's unfair, the friend's feelings are valid, and the author is in the wrong for continuing the behavior despite the friend's request.\n"
