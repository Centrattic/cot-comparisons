I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who is not overweight, is friends with someone who is. The author sometimes talks about their own body issues, like calling themselves fat, which makes the friend upset. The friend feels it's rude because she's trying to lose weight and it makes her uncomfortable. The author is confused about whether they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is talking about their own body, which is a personal issue. But the friend takes offense because she's dealing with her own body image struggles. The key point is whether the author's self-deprecating comments about their body are affecting the friend negatively.\n\nIn social contexts, people often have different sensitivities. Even if the author isn't targeting the friend, the friend might feel that the comments create a judgmental environment. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, so their body image issues might not be as pressing as the friend's. However, even if the author isn't at fault for having insecurities, their expression of those insecurities can impact others.\n\nThe friend's reaction is about her own feelings and needs. She's asking the author to respect her by not discussing her own weight in their presence. The author agreed initially but later felt it was unfair. The question is whether the author's actions were inappropriate.\n\nFrom a communication standpoint, it's important to be mindful of how our words affect others. Even when talking about oneself, the way we do it can influence those around us. The author's friend is in a vulnerable position, and the author's self-criticism might inadvertently make her feel worse about herself. So, even if the author's intention is self-expression, the impact on the friend matters.\n\nHowever, the author is also expressing their own insecurities, which are valid. The challenge is balancing personal expression with the sensitivity of the friend. The friend has the right to set boundaries if she's uncomfortable. So, the author might not be \"in the wrong\" in a moral sense, but they are not respecting the friend's boundaries, which is a social faux pas.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is likely A because the author's self-deprecating comments, while not targeting the friend, still caused harm. The author should consider the impact of their words and respect the friend's request.\n"
