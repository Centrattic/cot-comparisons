I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend who's upset when the author talks about her own body. The author is not overweight, but she calls herself fat. Her overweight friend gets upset because she's trying to lose weight, and the author's comments make the friend feel bad.\n\nFirst, the author says she's 125 lbs and not overweight, but she has insecurities. She tried on yoga pants and complained about her thighs and needing to lose weight. The friend, who is overweight and needs to lose 70 pounds, feels uncomfortable because she thinks the author is judging her. The author then agreed not to talk about her weight in front of her friend but now feels it was unfair. The question is whether the author was in the wrong when she criticized her own body in front of her friend.\n\nHmm. The key here is whether talking about one's own body in a negative way can affect others. Even if the author is talking about herself, her friend might interpret it as a comparison or judgment. The friend is struggling with her own weight issues, so hearing someone else (even a thinner person) talk about their body negatively could trigger her own insecurities. \n\nI remember some psychology about how people's self-esteem can be fragile. If someone is in a vulnerable place regarding their body image, hearing others talk badly about themselves might make them feel worse, especially if there's a comparison. So even though the author's intention was to express her own insecurities, it's possible that her friend took it the wrong way. \n\nThe author might not have meant to hurt her friend, but the impact is still there. The friend asked her not to talk about it, so maybe the author should respect that request. The author argues that it's about herself and not the friend, but the friend's reaction shows that it's affecting her. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might need to consider how her words affect others. Even self-deprecating comments can have unintended consequences. So while the author isn't necessarily being malicious, she might be in the wrong for not considering her friend's feelings in the situation.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because even though it's about her own body, her comments affected her friend negatively, and she should be considerate of that.\n"
