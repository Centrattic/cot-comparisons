I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking about their body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because when the author complained about their own weight, the friend felt it made her think about her own weight issues.\n\nSo, the author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have insecurities. They tried on yoga pants and said their thighs looked big and needed to lose weight. The friend is in plus size stores, needs to lose 70+ pounds, and felt uncomfortable because the author's comments made her feel judged. The author says it's about themselves and not the friend, but the friend still took offense.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide between A (wrong) or B (not wrong). Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is talking about their own body. But the friend is sensitive about her own weight. Even if the author isn't intending to make the friend feel bad, their words can still affect others. The friend's feelings are valid here. The author might not be aware of how their self-deprecating comments are impacting the friend. \n\nEven if the author is insecure, bringing up weight issues around someone who is already dealing with similar or worse issues can be hurtful. The friend asked them to stop, so the author agreed initially but now thinks it's unfair. The key is whether the author's self-talk is harmful even if it's about themselves. \n\nIn social situations, people's words can affect others, especially friends. The author's friend is in a more vulnerable position regarding weight, so the author's comments might inadvertently trigger her insecurities. The author needs to consider their friend's feelings, even if it's about their own body. \n\nBut then again, the author isn't directly criticizing the friend. They're expressing their own dissatisfaction. However, in a culture where weight is often stigmatized, such comments can still be problematic. The friend's reaction shows that the author's words had a negative impact. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean to offend, the result was that the friend felt uncomfortable. Therefore, the author should respect the friend's request. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because their self-criticism in front of a friend with weight issues caused harm, even unintentionally.\n"
