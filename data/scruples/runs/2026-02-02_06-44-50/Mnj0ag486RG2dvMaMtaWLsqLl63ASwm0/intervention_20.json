I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's upset when the author talks about their own body, specifically mentioning needing to lose weight.\n\nFirst, the author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have insecurities. Their friend is plus-sized and feels uncomfortable when the author comments on their own body. The author tried on yoga pants, complained about their thighs and needing to lose weight, which made their friend upset. The friend said it's rude because she needs to lose weight too and it makes her feel judged. The author agreed not to talk about it but now thinks it was unfair.\n\nSo, the key points here are about how talking about one's own body image issues can affect others, especially those with their own struggles. Even though the author is commenting on themselves, the friend interprets it as a negative reflection, leading to discomfort. The author defended that it's about themselves, but the friend still feels impacted. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about empathy and considering how one's words affect others. Even if the author is talking about their own insecurities, the friend's reaction is valid. The author might not have realized the emotional impact. So, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they should consider their friend's feelings. However, some might argue that the friend is over-sensitive. But generally, being mindful of how others perceive your comments, especially in sensitive topics like body image, is important. So, I think A is correct.\n"
