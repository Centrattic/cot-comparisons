I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because when the author mentions their own weight issues, the friend feels it makes her uncomfortable, thinking maybe the author is judging her. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is talking about their own insecurities and trying to express that they're not overweight, but they have body image issues. They mention that they even compliment their friend, saying she looks great. The friend, on the other hand, is struggling with her own weight and might be sensitive to hearing someone else talk about their body, especially when they're in a similar situation but not as heavy.\n\nNow, the key point here is about the impact of the author's words on their friend. Even though the author is talking about themselves, the friend might interpret it as a comparison or a form of judgment. People with body image issues often react strongly to others discussing weight, even if it's not directed at them. The friend's request is about her own emotional well-being, so the author's continued comments could be hurtful, even if unintended.\n\nI remember that in communication, intent versus impact matters. The author might not have meant to hurt their friend, but the impact was negative. The friend is clearly stating that these conversations make her uncomfortable, so respecting that boundary is important for maintaining a healthy friendship. \n\nAlso, the author acknowledges that their friend is in a harder situation, needing to lose more weight. By talking about their own (lesser) weight issues, maybe it's unintentionally minimizing the friend's struggles. Even if the author is being honest about their own feelings, there's a need to consider how it affects others, especially someone who's already dealing with their own insecurities.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel it's their right to express their own body image concerns. But since the friend has expressed discomfort, the author's responsibility to respect that boundary comes into play. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the friend's feelings are valid and the author's actions are causing harm, then the author should adjust their behavior, even if it feels unfair.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the author isn't directly criticizing their friend, the act of talking about their own weight in front of someone who is sensitive to such topics is causing distress. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering their friend's feelings and not respecting her request.\n"
