I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is about the author talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend, who then gets upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have insecurities. They tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs and needing to lose weight. The friend, who is in a plus-size category, felt upset because the author's comments made her feel judged. She asked the author to stop talking about their weight in front of her. The author agreed initially but now thinks it was unfair.\n\nSo the question is whether the author was rude. The author is criticizing their own body, but the friend is sensitive because of her own weight issues. The key here is that even though the author is talking about themselves, it affects the friend's feelings. \n\nI remember that sometimes when people talk about their own body in a negative way, it can make others with similar issues feel worse, especially if they're in a vulnerable situation. The friend might feel that the author's self-criticism is a reflection on her own body, even if the author didn't intend it. \n\nThe author says they told the friend she looks great and that it's about themselves. But maybe the friend still felt uncomfortable. The author might not realize how their words impact others. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered considerate to be mindful of others' feelings, even when talking about oneself. The friend made a request, and the author agreed. If the author now thinks it was unfair, that's their opinion, but the friend's feelings are valid. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because their self-deprecating comments, even if well-intentioned, hurt the friend's feelings. The author should respect the friend's boundaries even if they don't fully understand the sensitivity. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
