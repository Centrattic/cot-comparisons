I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking about their body in front of their overweight friend who got upset.\n\nThe situation is that the author, who is not overweight, calls themselves fat and talks about needing to lose weight. Their friend, who is plus-sized, feels uncomfortable because she's trying to lose weight too, and the author's comments make her wonder what the author thinks of her. The author says they agreed not to do it but now think it was unfair.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about how talking about one's own body image can affect others. The author is self-deprecating, which is common, but the friend is sensitive because she's dealing with her own weight issues. The author claims it's not about the friend, but the friend feels it's a comparison.\n\nIn past advice columns I've read, people often get called out for bringing up their own body issues if it makes others uncomfortable, especially when there's a difference in their body types. Even if the author is being honest about their insecurities, the friend's feelings matter. The author agreed to stop at first but now feels it's unfair. But the friend's request was about her comfort, which is valid.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not considering how their comments affect their friend. Even if it's about themselves, the friend's reaction is real. The author could have found another way to discuss their insecurities without making the friend uncomfortable. The answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect the friend's feelings, even if unintentionally.\n"
