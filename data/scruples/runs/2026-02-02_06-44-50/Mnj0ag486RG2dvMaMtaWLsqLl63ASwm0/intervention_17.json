I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their overweight friend upset by talking about their own body. The situation involves the author, who is not overweight, talking about needing to lose weight in front of their friend, who is. The friend felt hurt because she's trying to lose weight too and it made her self-conscious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's intention was to express their own insecurities, not to criticize the friend. But the friend's reaction shows that the author's comments triggered her own self-esteem issues. The key here is whether talking about one's own body in front of someone else, especially when that someone has body image issues, is considered rude or harmful.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, people can have different sensitivities. Even if the author's words were about themselves, hearing someone else talk about their body in a negative light might make others compare themselves, especially if they're dealing with similar issues. The friend might feel like the author is indirectly making a comparison or downplaying her struggles.\n\nThe author argues that they were just talking about themselves and that the friend's reaction is unfair. However, the friend's feelings are valid. The author should have considered how their words might affect others. Even if the author didn't intend to hurt, the impact is still there. It's about empathy and being mindful of others' feelings.\n\nThe friend's request to stop talking about weight in front of her is a valid boundary. The author initially agreed but now feels it's unfair. But respecting boundaries is important in maintaining healthy relationships. The author needs to respect the friend's feelings even if they don't see the connection.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's comments were about their own insecurities, they had a negative effect on the friend. The author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the friend's perspective and needs to adjust their behavior to respect her feelings.\n"
