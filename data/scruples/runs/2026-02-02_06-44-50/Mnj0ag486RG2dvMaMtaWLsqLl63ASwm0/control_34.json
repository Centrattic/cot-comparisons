I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend, who got upset. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have insecurities. The friend is plus-sized and asked them not to talk about their weight in front of her. The author is confused because they were just talking about themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's perspective. She's dealing with her own weight issues and might be sensitive. If the author is criticizing their own body, even if it's just complaining, it might trigger the friend's insecurities. Even if the author isn't targeting the friend, the friend could feel compared to or feel judged indirectly. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is just expressing their own feelings. It's common for people to talk about their body image, but maybe in this case, it's causing discomfort. The friend clearly communicated her feelings, so the author should respect that. The author might not realize the impact of their words. \n\nIs it unfair for the friend to ask them to stop? The author feels it's unfair, but if the friend is uncomfortable, then the author should consider their feelings. Even if the author is not being mean, their words still affect others. So, the author might be in the wrong for not considering how their self-criticism affects their friend. The answer is probably A.\n"
