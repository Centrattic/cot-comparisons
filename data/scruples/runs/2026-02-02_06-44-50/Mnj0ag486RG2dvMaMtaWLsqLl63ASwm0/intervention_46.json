I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's friend, who is overweight, gets upset when the author calls herself fat. The author is 125 lbs and feels she's not overweight, but she has body insecurities. She tried on yoga pants and complained about her thighs, leading her friend to feel uncomfortable.\n\nThe friend is trying to lose weight and finds it hard when the author talks about her own weight in front of her. The author argues that it's about herself, not the friend. But the friend feels it's rude.\n\nHmm. So the core issue is whether talking about one's own body image issues in front of someone else who has similar or different issues is inappropriate. The author is saying she's not the one with the weight problem, but her friend is. The friend is sensitive because she's trying to lose weight and when the author talks about her own body parts (like large thighs) and needing to lose weight, it makes the friend compare herself.\n\nI think the key here is empathy and how actions affect others. Even if the author is talking about herself, her friend is taking it personally. The author might not intend to hurt, but the friend is hurt. The question is whether the author should consider her friend's feelings here. The friend asked her to stop, so even if the author feels it's about herself, she might need to respect the friend's feelings. \n\nSo, the author is talking about her own insecurities, but in a context where her friend is also dealing with her own body image issues. The friend's reaction is valid because she's feeling judged or uncomfortable. The author might not realize the impact of her words. In that case, the author could be in the wrong because even if she's talking about herself, it's causing harm to her friend. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the friend is being overly sensitive. But the user's friend is in a more challenging situation (needs to lose 70+ pounds), so her feelings are valid. The author agreed initially but later thought it was unfair. That suggests some conflict. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries matters. If the friend asked the author not to talk that way in front of her, and the author is now thinking it's unfair, that's a conflict. But maybe the author should honor the friend's request, even if she feels it's about herself. \n\nSo, I think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because while she's talking about herself, her friend's feelings are valid, and she should respect the friend's boundaries. Even if unintentional, the impact is there, and the friend asked her to stop.\n"
