I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's overweight friend gets upset when the author calls herself fat. The author is 125 lbs but has insecurities, while her friend is in plus-size stores. The author was trying on yoga pants and complained about her thighs, leading the friend to feel uncomfortable and ask her not to do that. The author now feels the request was unfair and is unsure if she was being rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend is dealing with her own weight issues and body image. When the author talks about her own body in a negative way, it might trigger the friend's insecurities. Even if the author is just talking about herself, the friend can't help but compare, especially since she's in a similar situation. The friend might feel that the author's comments are indirectly criticizing her, even if that's not the intention. \n\nThe author says she told her friend she looks great and that it's about herself. But maybe the friend still feels that the author's negative self-talk creates a standard or expectation that's hard for her to meet. Plus, when someone with a different body type (even if both are women) talks about their bodies negatively, it can affect others around them, especially those who are more sensitive due to their own issues.\n\nThe question is whether the author was being rude by talking about her own body. The friend asked her not to do it, so the author is conflicted. The key here is intent versus impact. The author's intent was to express her own insecurities, but the impact was hurting the friend. In such cases, even if the intent is good, the impact matters. \n\nSome people argue that you shouldn't be held accountable for how your words affect others, especially if they're not directed at them. However, in close relationships, being mindful of each other's feelings is important. The friend's reaction shows that the author's comments were harmful to her, so even if it's about the author's own body, it's considerate to respect the friend's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel it's her right to discuss her own body image. But since the friend is affected, maybe the author should adjust her behavior. It's a balance between personal expression and consideration for others. \n\nIn similar situations, people often advise being aware of how your words might impact others, even if they're about yourself. So the author might be in the wrong here because they didn't consider the friend's sensitivity enough. The friend's request is valid because she's in a vulnerable spot, and the author's choice to talk about her own body in that context was hurtful. \n\nTherefore, the answer would lean towards A, the author is in the wrong, because even though it's about her own body, she should have been more mindful of her friend's feelings and possible triggers.\n"
