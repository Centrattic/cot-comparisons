I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because she thinks it makes her feel bad, even though the author was talking about themselves.\n\nSo, the author tried on yoga pants, complained about their thighs looking big and needing to lose weight. The friend, who is heavier, felt uncomfortable because she's trying to lose 70 pounds and it made her wonder what the author thought of her. The author says they didn't mean to target the friend and think she looks great.\n\nHmm. The key here is that the author was talking about their own insecurities, but the friend took it as a reflection on her own body. Even if the author was just venting about themselves, the friend might feel that such comments are triggering or hurtful. People have different sensitivities, especially when it comes to body image. The author might not have intended to make the friend feel worse, but the effect is there. \n\nThe question is whether it's wrong to talk about one's own body in a way that makes someone else uncomfortable. Some might argue that people shouldn't have to suppress their own insecurities, especially if they're not directly targeting others. But others might say that if it's causing someone else distress, it's considerate to avoid it.\n\nThe friend asked the author to stop talking about needing to lose weight in front of her. The author agreed initially but now feels it was unfair. The user is asking if the author was actually wrong. \n\nIn many cases, when someone's actions affect another person's feelings negatively, it's considered considerate to adjust, even if the original intent was innocent. So even if the author was talking about themselves, if it's causing the friend discomfort, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the friend's feelings. \n\nBut the author could also feel that they shouldn't have to censor their own self-talk. It's a bit of a gray area. However, since the friend clearly expressed her feelings and asked the author to stop, the author might be in the wrong by continuing or by not considering the impact, even if it wasn't intentional. \n\nSo, the answer probably leans towards A, the author is in the wrong, because respecting others' feelings is important, even if the comments were about oneself.\n"
