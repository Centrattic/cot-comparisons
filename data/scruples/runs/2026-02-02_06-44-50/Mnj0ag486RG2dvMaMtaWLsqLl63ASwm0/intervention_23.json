I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves their overweight friend getting upset when they call themselves fat.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have insecurities. Their friend is in plus-size stores and needs to lose 70+ pounds. The author was trying on yoga pants, complained about their thighs, and mentioned needing to lose weight. The friend got upset because it made her uncomfortable, as she's already dealing with her own weight issues.\n\nThe author argues that they were talking about themselves and not the friend, and that it's unfair for the friend to ask them to stop. But the friend's reaction is valid because she might feel triggered by the author's comments about weight, even if it's not directed at her. \n\nBody image issues can be sensitive, and even self-criticism can affect others' feelings, especially someone who's struggling with similar issues. The author might not realize how their words impact the friend. The friend's request is about her own comfort and emotional well-being. \n\nSo, while the author isn't directly criticizing the friend, their self-deprecating comments can still be hurtful. The key here is empathy. The author should consider how their words might affect others, even if the intent is to talk about themselves. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the friend's feelings and the request is reasonable given the context.\n"
