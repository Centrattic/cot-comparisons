I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is 125 lbs and has an overweight friend. The friend shops in plus-size stores, so she's definitely larger. The author mentions that they have insecurities but is otherwise okay. The problem happened when they were shopping, and the author tried on yoga pants, complained about their thighs looking large, and said they need to lose weight and go to the gym more. The friend got upset, feeling that the author's comments are rude. The friend explained that since she needs to lose 70+ pounds, hearing the author talk about their own weight makes her wonder what the author thinks of her and causes discomfort. The author tried to reassure the friend that it's about themselves, but the friend still asked them to stop. The author agreed initially but now feels it was an unfair request. They're wondering if they were in the wrong for talking negatively about their own body in front of the friend.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know if I agree. The options are A for yes, B for no.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The author is expressing their own insecurities about their body. The friend is sensitive about her own weight issues, so when the author talks about their own weight, the friend feels it's a reflection on her. The question is whether the author was being rude by talking about their own body.\n\nIn general, people have different sensitivities. Even if the author is talking about themselves, someone else with their own insecurities might take it personally. The friend is in a situation where losing weight is a significant goal for her, so hearing someone else talk about their own weight loss needs might trigger her own feelings of insecurity or inadequacy. \n\nThe author might argue that it's their own body and they have the right to discuss their insecurities. However, the friend is asking them to respect her feelings. The key here is about empathy and considering how one's words affect others, even when talking about oneself. \n\nIn social situations, it's often considered polite to be mindful of others' sensitivities. If someone's self-talk about weight is causing distress to a friend, then maybe the author should be more careful. The fact that the friend asked them to stop and the author initially agreed suggests that maybe the author understood the request at the time. Now, they're questioning if it's unfair, but the friend's feelings are valid. \n\nSo, even though the author isn't directly criticizing the friend, their self-deprecating comments can still be hurtful. The author's intentions were about themselves, but the impact on the friend is real. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering how their words affect their friend. \n\nI think the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because they didn't consider their friend's feelings and their self-deprecating comments triggered the friend's insecurities, even if unintentionally.\n"
