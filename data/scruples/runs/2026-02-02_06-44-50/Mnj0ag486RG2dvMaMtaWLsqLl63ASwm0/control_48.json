I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who is not overweight, calls themselves fat in front of their overweight friend, which upsets the friend. The friend feels that the author's comments make her uncomfortable because she's trying to lose weight and the author's self-criticism makes her wonder what the author thinks about her.\n\nSo the question is, does the author deserve the backlash from their friend? Let's break it down. The author is talking about their own body, which they admit is not overweight. But when they do this in front of their friend, the friend gets upset. The friend is in a situation where she needs to lose a significant amount of weight, so she's probably sensitive about body-related comments, even if they're directed at herself.\n\nThe author argues that they were talking about themselves and not the friend, but the friend's reaction shows that she felt affected. The key here is whether talking about one's own body image issues in front of someone else who has different body image concerns is inherently rude or not. \n\nOn one hand, the author isn't making direct comments about the friend. They're expressing their own insecurities. But on the other hand, people can take things differently. If the friend is struggling with her weight, hearing someone else (even a friend) talk about their \"fat\" or needing to lose weight might trigger her own insecurities. The friend might feel that the author's self-criticism is somehow judgmental or that it's creating an environment where she feels judged.\n\nThe author mentions that they agreed to stop talking about it, but now feel it was unfair. The friend's request is about her comfort level, and while the author might not see it as harmful, the friend does. So, the author's actions, even if well-intentioned, caused the friend distress. In such cases, respecting the friend's boundaries is important, even if the author doesn't fully agree with the reason.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean to be rude, the friend felt it was rude. The author should consider that their friend's feelings are valid and adjust their behavior accordingly. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting their friend's request after understanding her feelings.\n"
