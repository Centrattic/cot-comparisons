I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author did something wrong by talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is 125 lbs and isn't overweight, but they have insecurities. They made a comment about their thighs looking large and needing to lose weight. Their friend, who is in a larger size and needs to shop at plus-size stores, got upset. The friend mentioned that she needs to lose 70 pounds and that hearing the author talk about their weight made her uncomfortable, as it made her wonder what the author thought about her.\n\nThe author is confused because they told their friend she looks great and that the comments were about themselves. The friend still felt it was rude, and the author now feels the request to stop talking about their weight is unfair.\n\nHmm. The key here is whether talking about one's own body can affect others, especially when there's a difference in body size. The friend's reaction suggests that the author's comments triggered her own insecurities. Even though the author's comments were self-directed, the friend might have interpreted them as a comparison or a subtle judgment. Body image issues are sensitive, and people can take self-criticism as a reflection on others, especially those in different size categories.\n\nThe author acknowledges they shouldn't talk that way in general, which is a good point. But the main issue is the impact on the friend. Even if the author didn't intend to hurt, the friend felt hurt. In such situations, respecting the friend's feelings is important. The author's friend asked them to stop, so continuing might be inconsiderate, even if the author feels it's unfair. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions, despite being self-directed, caused harm. If the friend is genuinely upset and the author's comments are a trigger, then the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the friend's boundaries. Even though the author didn't mean to target the friend, the effect is real. Therefore, the author should consider the friend's perspective and perhaps avoid such comments in the future to maintain a respectful friendship.\n"
