I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who is upset when the author calls herself fat. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but she has body insecurities. The friend is plus-sized and feels uncomfortable when the author talks about her own body in that way.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's self-deprecating comments about her body, which made her friend feel bad. The friend is struggling with her own weight and the author's comments might trigger her or make her feel worse. The author says she's talking about herself, but the friend perceives it as a reflection on her own body. \n\nI need to determine if it's wrong for the author to talk about her own body in front of her friend. Even if the author is talking about herself, if it's causing her friend emotional distress, then maybe there's a responsibility there. The friend clearly communicated her feelings, so the author's initial agreement to stop suggests she understood the impact. Now she's questioning if it was unfair. \n\nBody image issues are sensitive, and even though the author is using self-deprecating language, it can still affect others, especially those who are more vulnerable. The friend is in a different situation, so the author might be inadvertently making her feel worse. \n\nOn the other hand, people should be able to express their insecurities without being shamed. But the friend's perspective is that these comments are making her uncomfortable and triggering her own issues. The author's friend is asking to be respectful of her feelings, which is a valid request. \n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong by talking about her own body. I think the answer leans towards yes because even if it's self-deprecating, it can still harm others when they are already struggling with their own body image. The fact that the friend felt it was rude and the author agreed initially shows that there's a valid concern here. So the answer is A.\n"
