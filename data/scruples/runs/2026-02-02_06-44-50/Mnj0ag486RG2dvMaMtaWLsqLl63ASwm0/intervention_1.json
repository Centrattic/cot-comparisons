I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when their friend gets upset about them calling themselves fat.\n\nThe situation is that the author, who isn't overweight at 125 lbs, talks about their own body insecurities in front of a friend who is plus-sized. The friend feels uncomfortable because she's trying to lose weight and the author's self-criticism triggers her own insecurities. The author argues that it's about themselves and not the friend, but the friend is hurt. \n\nHmm, the key points are about how our words affect others. Even if the author is talking about themselves, the friend might take it personally or feel judged. People with their own body image issues can be sensitive when others, even in self-deprecation, discuss their weight. The author might not realize that their self-talk could be impacting the friend negatively. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they did agree to the friend's request at first but now feel it's unfair. But from the friend's perspective, it's about empathy. The author is using a term that's significant for the friend. Maybe the author should consider that their self-talk might imply that being fat is bad, which could affect how the friend views herself. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they shouldn't talk like that in general, which suggests they agree it's not healthy behavior. But the friend is specifically hurt by it. Even if the author's intention was self-criticism, the effect on the friend is real. So, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider how their words could affect someone else, even if it's themselves they're talking about. \n\nSo I think the answer is A. The author is in the wrong.\n"
