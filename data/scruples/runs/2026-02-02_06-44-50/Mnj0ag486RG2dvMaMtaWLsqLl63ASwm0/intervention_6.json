I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for talking about their body in front of their overweight friend. \n\nFirst, the author's friend is upset when the author calls themselves fat. The author is 125 lbs but comments on their thighs and needing to lose weight. The friend, who is overweight, feels uncomfortable because her own weight issues come up when the author does this.\n\nHmm. The author argues that it's about themselves and not about the friend. But the friend's reaction shows that the author's self-talk triggers her insecurities. Even if the author isn't directly criticizing the friend, the context matters. The friend is in a vulnerable position, and the author's comments might inadvertently compare them or make the friend feel judged. \n\nSociety often ties weight to morality or self-control. If the author is criticizing their own weight, the friend might internalize that as a judgment of her own weight, even if that's not the intent. The friend's request is about her comfort in a friendship where such comments aren't necessary. The author might not realize the impact of their words. \n\nThe author says they agreed to stop but now think the request was unfair. However, respecting a friend's boundaries is important. Even if the author feels it's about themselves, the friend's feelings are valid. So, the author might be in the wrong because their self-talk affects the friend negatively, even without intent.\n"
