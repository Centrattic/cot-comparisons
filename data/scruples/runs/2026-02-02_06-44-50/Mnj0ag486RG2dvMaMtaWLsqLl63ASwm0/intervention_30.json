I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who is 125 lbs, calls themselves fat in front of their overweight friend. The friend gets upset because she's trying to lose weight and finds it uncomfortable when the author talks about their own weight. The author is confused because they meant it as self-deprecating humor or just expressing their own insecurities, but the friend felt targeted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author isn't overweight, so they might not realize that body image issues are sensitive for people around them. Even if it's about themselves, talking about weight loss can trigger others who are struggling with similar issues. The friend is in a situation where she's trying to lose weight, so hearing her friend talk about their own weight might make her feel worse about herself. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might think they have the right to discuss their own body without causing harm. They might not intend to hurt their friend's feelings. But the key here is the impact of their words. Even if the intention was just to talk about themselves, the result was that the friend felt uncomfortable. The friend has the right to set boundaries, right? So by the friend asking the author to avoid those conversations, the author should respect that boundary even if they think it's unfair.\n\nBut wait, the author says they \"think my friend looks great!\" So they aren't making fun of the friend. The problem is that their own insecurities are affecting the friend who's sensitive on the same topic. Maybe the author's negative talk about their own weight makes the friend compare herself, leading to discomfort. The author might not see the connection, but the friend's reaction is valid. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they're 125 lbs, which is likely a healthy weight, so their own body image issues are separate. However, in a society that often stigmatizes weight, even people at healthy weights can have body image issues. But when someone who is in a healthy weight range talks about their body negatively in front of someone who is overweight, it can unintentionally imply that their weight is a problem too. \n\nThe friend's request is about her own feelings and well-being. The author might feel it's unfair because they're not targeting the friend, but the friend's needs take precedence here. If the author is friends with her, they should consider her feelings and adjust their behavior. So even if the author thinks they're not in the wrong, the act of talking about weight in front of someone who's sensitive to it is causing harm. Therefore, the author is in the right to adjust their behavior to respect the friend's boundaries, even if it feels unfair. So the answer would be A\u2014Yes, the author is in the wrong because their comments, though self-directed, are causing unnecessary distress to their friend.\n"
