I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their friend, who is also struggling with weight. The friend feels upset because the author's comments about their own body make the friend think about their own weight issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have insecurities. Their friend is in plus-size stores and wants to lose 70+ pounds. The author was talking about their thighs looking big and needing to lose weight, which made the friend uncomfortable. The friend asked the author to stop talking about their weight in front of her.\n\nThe key point here is whether talking about one's own body negatively can affect others, even if it's not about them. People can internalize others' comments, especially if they have similar issues. Even if the author's intention was self-criticism, the friend might feel triggered or compared. The author might not realize the impact of their words on someone else's self-esteem.\n\nThe author argues that it's about themselves and not the friend, but the friend's reaction shows it's affecting her. The author initially agreed to stop but now feels it's unfair. However, the friend's request is valid because her feelings are hurt. The question is about whether the author was wrong, not just the friend's feelings.\n\nIn terms of social interactions, being mindful of others' sensitivities is important. Even if the author isn't targeting the friend, the content of the conversation can still be harmful. So, the author might be in the wrong for not considering how their self-criticism affects the friend. The answer would likely be A (Yes), because the author's comments, while about themselves, caused distress to the friend, and respecting others' boundaries is crucial.\n"
