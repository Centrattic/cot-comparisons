I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because the author was complaining about their own weight, which made the friend feel self-conscious. The author says they're not overweight, but their friend is, and the author was just expressing their own insecurities.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about how the friend felt. Even if the author was talking about themselves, the friend might have taken it as a reflection on their own body. People can have different sensitivities, especially if they're dealing with their own body image issues. The friend asked the author not to talk like that in front of her, so there's a request made. The author agreed initially but then felt it was unfair. \n\nBut the question is if the author was in the wrong. Even though the author was talking about themselves, the impact on the friend is important. The friend's feelings are valid here. Maybe the author didn't realize how their self-criticism could affect someone else. The friend might feel that whenever the author talks about weight, it reminds the friend of her own weight issues, which are more severe. \n\nThe author does mention that they think the friend looks great, but words can sometimes have unintended consequences. Even if it's not about the friend, the friend's reaction is a valid reason for her to ask the author to stop. So, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider how their words affect their friend's feelings, even if it's self-deprecating. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is expressing their own insecurities, which is a personal issue. But since the friend is more sensitive to weight-related topics, the author should maybe be mindful. The answer probably leans towards the author being in the wrong because they need to respect their friend's feelings and boundaries even if it's their own body they're talking about. So I think the answer is A.\n"
