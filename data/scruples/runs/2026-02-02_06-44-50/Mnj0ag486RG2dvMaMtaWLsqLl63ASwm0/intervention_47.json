I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 125 lbs, not overweight, but has insecurities. Their friend is overweight and shops at plus-size stores. The author tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs and needing to lose weight. The friend got upset because she's trying to lose 70+ pounds and felt the author's comments made her uncomfortable. The author told their friend they look great, but the friend still asked them not to talk about needing to lose weight around her. The author is now wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about body image, the impact of self-deprecating comments on others, and the dynamics of friendship. The author is questioning if their self-criticism was hurting their friend's feelings. The friend is sensitive because she's dealing with her own weight issues and might see the author's comments as adding to the stigma or making her feel worse.\n\nI need to consider the perspective of both sides. The author isn't targeting the friend directly but talking about their own insecurities. However, the friend's reaction is valid because body image issues can be triggering for others. Even if the author isn't aiming to hurt, the friend is clearly affected. The question is whether the author's self-deprecation is rude or hurtful in this context.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they agreed to stop talking about it but now feel it was unfair. This shows a conflict between personal expression and consideration for a friend's feelings. The friend's request is about her emotional well-being, which is important to respect in a friendship.\n\nSo, the author's actions, while not malicious, might still be considered inconsiderate. Even if the author is being honest about their own insecurities, the friend's feelings matter. The author could have been more mindful of how their words might affect someone else who is sensitive about their weight. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often don't realize how their self-criticism can impact others, especially those with similar issues. The key here is empathy and recognizing that self-deprecating remarks can unintentionally validate negative stereotypes or make others feel judged. The author might have thought they were just being honest, but the friend's reaction shows that the impact was negative.\n\nTherefore, even though the author is talking about themselves, the effect on the friend is real. So the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider how their self-criticism might affect their friend's feelings, despite the friend's size being different from their own.\n"
