I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their body in front of their overweight friend. The situation is that the author (who is 125 lbs) called themselves fat and talked about needing to lose weight, which upset their friend. The friend is plus-sized and was already dealing with her own insecurities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is making negative comments about their own body, which isn't the same as making a joke or a comment that's targeted at someone else. But the friend took it personally because she struggles with her own weight. The key point here is whether talking about one's own body in a negative way can inadvertently hurt someone else, even if it's not directed at them.\n\nI remember that sometimes when people talk about their own body image issues, others might internalize it, especially if they have their own insecurities. The friend might feel that the author is implying that her weight is worse, or that the author's own issues make the friend's issues seem worse. The friend's reaction is about her own feelings, not the author's intentions. \n\nThe author says they think their friend looks great, but their own insecurity discussion might conflict with that. Even if the author's intention was self-criticism, the friend's perspective is that hearing someone else talk about their body in that way makes her feel worse about herself. The author might not have realized the impact of their words. \n\nBut then again, should the author be expected to censor their own self-talk just because someone else is sensitive? It's a balance between personal expression and considering others' feelings. The author isn't directly criticizing the friend, but the friend's sensitivity is valid. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't being malicious, but their words do affect the friend negatively. The friend is asking them to stop, which the author initially agreed to but now feels it's unfair. The author's responsibility here might be to respect the friend's feelings even if it's unintentional. So, maybe the answer is A, yes, the author is in the wrong because even though it's about themselves, the impact on the friend matters, and they should adjust their behavior to respect her feelings. Alternatively, maybe B, because the author isn't targeting the friend and shouldn't have to suppress their own self-talk. But I think the correct answer leans towards A because the friend's feelings are valid and the author should consider that their comments, though self-directed, are causing harm. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
