I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their body in front of their overweight friend, making the friend upset.\n\nSo the situation is that the author (who is not overweight) was talking about their own body, complaining about their thighs and needing to lose weight. The friend, who is overweight and needs plus-sized clothes, got upset because this made her feel self-conscious. The friend explained that when the author talks about their own weight, she (the friend) compares herself and feels worse because she has more weight to lose. She asked the author to stop talking about their weight in front of her. The author agreed initially but now thinks it's unfair and is unsure if it's their fault.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is at fault. Let me consider the dynamics here.\n\nFirst, the author is talking about their own body image issues. Even if they're not being mean to the friend, the content of their self-criticism might trigger the friend's insecurities. The friend's reaction is about how she feels when hearing the author's comments. The author might not have intended to hurt the friend, but the effect is there. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, when someone shares their self-criticism, others might take it personally, especially if their own body image is sensitive. The friend's request to avoid that topic shows that the author's comments had a negative impact. The author's defense is that they were talking about themselves, not the friend. But the friend's perspective is that the author's words affect her self-esteem. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on intent versus impact. If the author didn't realize how their words affect the friend, maybe they're not in the wrong intentionally. However, once the friend expressed discomfort, the author should respect that and adjust their behavior. The author's initial agreement to stop suggests they acknowledged the friend's feelings, but now they're questioning it. \n\nI think the key here is empathy and respect for others' feelings. Even if the author is talking about themselves, if it's causing someone else distress, it's considerate to avoid that topic in their presence. The author's self-criticism isn't directed at the friend, but the friend's reaction is valid. So the author might not be in the wrong in a malicious sense, but they are in the wrong in terms of being insensitive to the friend's feelings. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
