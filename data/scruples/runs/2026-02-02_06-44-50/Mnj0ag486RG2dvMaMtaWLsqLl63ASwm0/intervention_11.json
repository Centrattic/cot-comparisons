I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who is not overweight, talks about their own body and wanting to lose weight in front of their overweight friend. The friend gets upset because she's trying to lose weight too and it makes her uncomfortable. The author claims it's about themselves, but the friend feels it's rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's friend is dealing with her own body image issues, and when the author talks about her own weight, it might trigger the friend's insecurities. Even if the author is talking about themselves, the friend is comparing herself and feeling judged. The author might not intend to hurt her, but the effect is there.\n\nThe key question is whether talking negatively about one's own body around someone who has body image issues is inappropriate. Some people might argue that it's a personal choice, and the author isn't the problem. Others might say that if someone is sensitive to body-related comments, even if it's about yourself, it's considerate to avoid it to not hurt their feelings.\n\nI think the author's friend is valid in feeling upset. The author's statements could be seen as contributing to a negative environment around body image, even if unintentional. The author's friend might feel that the author's comments are reinforcing a standard of beauty that she's struggling to meet. So, the author should be more mindful and respect the friend's feelings. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
