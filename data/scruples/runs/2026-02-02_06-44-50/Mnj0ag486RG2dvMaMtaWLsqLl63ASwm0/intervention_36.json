I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a 125-pound person who sometimes talks about their own weight and body image issues in front of their overweight friend. The friend gets upset because she's trying to lose weight and the author's comments make her feel uncomfortable, making her think the author is judging her. The author agrees to stop talking about their weight in front of the friend but later feels it was unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is expressing their own insecurities, which are valid. They might not have realized the impact their words have on their friend. On the other hand, the friend is in a sensitive spot with her own weight loss goals, so hearing the author talk about their own weight could trigger her self-esteem issues. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's self-deprecating comments, even if meant as personal reflections, are affecting someone else's emotional well-being. The friend explicitly said it makes her uncomfortable and that she feels judged. Even if the author's intention was to talk about themselves, the effect on the friend is real. \n\nIn social interactions, it's important to consider how our words affect others. The author might not have intended to hurt, but the friend's reaction is valid. So, even though the author isn't necessarily \"wrong\" in wanting to express their own feelings, they might be in the wrong for not considering their friend's feelings. The friend has the right to ask for a boundary. \n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because their behavior, even if self-directed, causes discomfort to their friend, and respecting others' feelings is important even when discussing personal insecurities.\n"
