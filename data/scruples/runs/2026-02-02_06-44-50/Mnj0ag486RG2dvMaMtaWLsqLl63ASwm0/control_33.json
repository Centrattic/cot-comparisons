I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's overweight friend gets upset when the author calls herself fat. The author is 125 lbs and realizes she's not overweight, but she has insecurities. The friend, who is in plus-size stores, feels uncomfortable when the author talks about her own weight in front of her. The friend says it makes her wonder what the author thinks of her and is uncomfortable. The author tried to explain it's about herself, but the friend asked her not to talk about needing to lose weight anymore. The author now feels it's unfair.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the author is wrong to talk about her own body in that context. Let me think. The author is criticizing her own body, which is a personal choice, but the friend is taking it personally. The friend's reaction is valid because even if the author is talking about herself, the friend might internalize it, especially since she's dealing with her own weight issues. It's possible that the author's self-criticism triggers the friend's insecurities. \n\nBut does that make the author wrong? Well, the author is allowed to have body image issues and express them, but maybe she didn't consider how her words affect her friend. The friend's request is about their relationship dynamics. The author might not be in the wrong for having insecurities or expressing them, but she might be in the wrong for not being mindful of her friend's feelings. \n\nThe friend's perspective is that when someone she's close to talks about weight loss, even if it's about herself, it could make the friend feel judged. So the author's actions caused discomfort, which the author might not have intended. The key here is whether the author's self-talk is causing harm, even if unintended. If the friend is affected, then maybe the author should adjust, even if it feels unfair. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is supposed to be allowed to talk about her own body. But in this case, since the friend is sensitive, maybe the author should make an effort to avoid that in front of her. The author's friend is being honest about her feelings, so the author might need to respect that request, even if it seems unreasonable from her perspective. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. But since the friend is clearly hurt and the author's actions, while unintentional, are causing discomfort, the answer might lean towards the author needing to adjust their behavior. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's self-talk is not inherently rude, but the friend is sensitive, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but should be more considerate. The friend's request is about their relationship, so the author might not be in the wrong for the action itself but should comply with the friend's request to maintain the relationship. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A for Yes, meaning the author is wrong, then it's because her self-criticism is causing harm. If B for No, it's because she's allowed to talk about her own body. \n\nI think the answer is A. Because even if it's about herself, it's affecting her friend's feelings. So the author is in the wrong for not being considerate enough, even if it's unintentional. So the answer is A.\n"
