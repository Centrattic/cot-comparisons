I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is that the author is in a conversation with their overweight friend. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but has body insecurities. When trying on yoga pants, the author comments on their own thighs looking large and needing to lose weight and go to the gym more. The friend gets upset and tells the author that talking about their own body in that way is rude because it makes the friend think about her own weight (she needs to lose 70+ pounds) and feel uncomfortable. The author agreed to stop but now feels it was an unfair request.\n\nFirst, the question is whether the author was being rude. The friend's reaction is important. Even though the author is talking about themselves, their friend is clearly affected by it. The friend's sensitivity is valid because people who struggle with their weight might feel triggered or anxious when others, even if they're not overweight, express body dissatisfaction. The author claims they weren't targeting the friend, but the friend's experience is that it makes her uncomfortable. \n\nNow, the author says they have insecurities too, but the friend's issue is that the author's comments reflect on her. The key here is about how our words affect others, even if the intention is to talk about ourselves. Body image issues are personal, and for someone who is already dealing with their own weight concerns, hearing a friend express self-criticism might exacerbate their feelings. The author's friend might be comparing herself, even if the author is smaller and not overweight. \n\nThe author also mentions they think their friend looks great, which is good, but the act of speaking negatively about their own body in front of her could still have a negative impact. The friend's request is about her comfort, and the author agreed initially but now feels it's unfair. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. If the author's friend is genuinely hurt by those comments, even if the author is talking about themselves, then the author should respect the friend's feelings. People have different sensitivities, and even self-deprecating remarks can be triggering. So maybe the author is in the wrong here because they need to consider the friend's perspective and the impact of their words, even if they're not about the friend. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author has the right to express their own insecurities. But in a close friendship, communication is key. The friend made her feelings known, so the author should honor that request. The alternative is to find a way to talk about their own body image issues without making the friend uncomfortable. \n\nSo the answer here is likely that the author is in the wrong (A), because even though the comments are about themselves, they're affecting the friend's emotional state, and the friend has the right to ask them to stop if it's causing discomfort. The author's initial agreement shows they recognized that, even if they later questioned it.\n"
