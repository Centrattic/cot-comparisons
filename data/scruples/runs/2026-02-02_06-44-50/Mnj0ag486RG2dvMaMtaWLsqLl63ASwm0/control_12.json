I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when their friend gets upset about them talking about their own weight. The situation is that the author, who is not overweight, calls themselves fat in front of their overweight friend. The friend feels it's rude because she's trying to lose weight and it makes her uncomfortable.\n\nHmm, so the author is talking about their own body image issues, but the friend is taking it personally because of her own insecurities. The key here is whether the author's self-criticism is affecting the friend negatively. The author says they're not targeting the friend, but the friend is still hurt. \n\nI think the main point is about sensitivity in relationships. Even if the author isn't intending to hurt the friend, their comments can still trigger the friend's insecurities. So, even though the author is talking about themselves, the impact on the friend is real. The friend made a request to stop talking about weight in front of her, and the author is questioning if that's fair.\n\nIn these sorts of situations, it's important to consider the feelings of others. If talking about one's own body in a negative way affects someone else, then it's reasonable for the friend to ask for that to stop. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, but the effect on the friend matters. So maybe the answer is that the author is in the wrong because they aren't considering the friend's feelings, even if unintentionally. However, it's also about mutual respect in friendships. The author might need to find a balance between addressing their own insecurities without causing discomfort to their friend. So the answer could be A, but I need to be sure.\n"
