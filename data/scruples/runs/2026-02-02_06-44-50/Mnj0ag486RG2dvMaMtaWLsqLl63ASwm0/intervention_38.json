I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is 125 lbs and has a friend who is overweight. The author calls themselves \"fat\" and talks about needing to lose weight, which upsets the friend. The friend is sensitive because she needs to lose weight too and feels uncomfortable hearing the author talk that way about their body, even though the author is smaller.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about how talking about one's own body image can affect others. The author might not realize that their self-criticism could trigger similar insecurities in their friend. The friend is in a worse position because she's larger and might feel judged or compared to the author. Even if the author isn't directly targeting her, the friend might internalize the comments as a reflection on herself. \n\nBut the author is talking about their own body, so is that their fault? Well, in social interactions, we're often expected to consider how our words affect others. If the friend made it clear that the author's comments are hurtful, then the author might be responsible for adjusting their behavior. The author agreed initially but then felt it was unfair. But the friend's feelings are valid, right? People's body image issues can be sensitive, especially when they're struggling with weight. \n\nSo the author's intention was to express their own insecurities, but the impact on the friend was negative. The question is whether that makes the author in the wrong. Since the friend communicated her feelings and the author acknowledged that it's rude to talk about weight in general, maybe the author should have been more mindful. Even if it's about themselves, the context and the friend's sensitivity matter. \n\nI think the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because their self-criticism inadvertently harmed their friend's feelings, even if unintended. The friend's request is valid, and the author should respect that boundary.\n"
