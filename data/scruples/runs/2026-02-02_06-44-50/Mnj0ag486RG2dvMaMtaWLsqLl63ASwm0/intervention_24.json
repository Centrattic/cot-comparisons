I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's overweight friend gets upset when the author calls herself fat. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but she has insecurities. The friend, who is in a plus-size category, feels hurt when the author talks about her own weight in front of her. The friend says it's rude because she needs to lose 70+ pounds, so it makes her wonder what the author thinks of her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author is talking about her own body negatively, which the friend interprets as a reflection on her. The friend is struggling with her weight and might have low self-esteem, so hearing about weight loss discussions from someone who isn't overweight could trigger her. The author argues that it's about her own insecurities, not the friend, but the friend still feels uncomfortable.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's self-deprecating comments about her weight were inappropriate in the context of her friendship with someone who has different body image issues. Even if the author isn't being mean, the friend is hurt. The author might not realize how her words affect others. The friend is asking her not to talk about her weight around her, which is a valid request if it's causing discomfort.\n\nOn one hand, the author is expressing her own insecurities, which are valid. But on the other hand, she needs to consider her friend's feelings. The friend's response is understandable because body image issues can be sensitive. The author might not have intended to hurt, but the impact is there. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not respecting her friend's feelings, even if it's about her own body.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants confirmation. I should consider if the author was being rude by not taking her friend's feelings into account. Since the friend made it clear that these comments upset her, the author should adjust her behavior to respect that. Even if the author doesn't see the connection, her friend does, so continuing the behavior after being asked not to would be wrong. So the answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
