I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. Let me break this down. \n\nThe situation is that the author, who is not overweight at 125 lbs, made comments about their own thighs and needing to lose weight and go to the gym. Their friend, who is significantly heavier and needs plus-size clothing, got upset. The friend explained that hearing the author talk about their body makes her uncomfortable because she's thinking about her own 70-pound weight loss goal. The author says they agreed to stop but now feel it was unfair.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about body image and how comments about one's own weight can affect others, especially when they are in a different situation. The author is being honest about their own insecurities, but the friend is sensitive to those comments. Even though the author is talking about themselves, the friend interprets it as a reflection on her own body. \n\nI remember that in discussions about body image, even self-deprecating comments can be harmful if they perpetuate negative stereotypes or make others feel worse. The friend might feel that the author's comments reinforce stigma against larger bodies, making her feel judged. The author's intention was to express personal insecurity, but the impact was negative on the friend. \n\nAlso, the friend's request is about her own comfort. The author might think it's about themself, but if the friend is uncomfortable, respecting that boundary is important in a friendship. The author does agree that they shouldn't talk like that in general, which suggests they might have some guilt. \n\nSo, even if the author is not being malicious, the act of making self-critical body comments in front of someone who is struggling with their weight can be hurtful. The friend's reaction is valid because it's about her emotional well-being. The author should consider how their words affect others and maybe find alternative ways to discuss their insecurities without triggering their friend. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong because their self-deprecating remarks, despite being about themselves, had a negative impact on their friend and the friend's request to stop is a reasonable boundary.\n"
