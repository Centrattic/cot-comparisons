I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because when the author mentions needing to lose weight, it makes the friend uncomfortable, especially since she also needs to lose weight but feels self-conscious. The author argues it's about themselves and not the friend, but the friend feels it's rude.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the context. The author is 125 lbs, which they acknowledge isn't overweight, but they have insecurities. The friend is in plus-size stores, so she's struggling with her weight more. The author talks about their own body negatively, which the friend interprets as making her feel worse about herself. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, even if the author is talking about themselves, it's possible that their comments indirectly affect the friend's self-esteem. If the friend is already dealing with body image issues, hearing someone else talk negatively about their body might trigger her insecurities. But the author might not have realized that their words could have that effect. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't intend to hurt the friend. They even complimented her before. But maybe they should have been more mindful of how their self-criticism might make the friend feel. It's a common thing in relationships\u2014people's words can impact others unexpectedly. \n\nThe friend asked the author to stop talking about needing to lose weight around her. The author agreed initially but later thought it was unfair. The question is whether the author was actually wrong. \n\nI think the key here is about being considerate. Even if the author is talking about themselves, if they know their friend is sensitive about her weight, they might need to adjust their behavior to avoid causing discomfort. So maybe the friend's request is valid, and the author should respect that even if they don't see the connection. \n\nBut some might argue that the author isn't in the wrong because they were just expressing their own insecurities. However, in close relationships, we often have to be mindful of how our words affect others. So the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because even if unintended, the words caused harm, and the author should be more considerate.\n"
