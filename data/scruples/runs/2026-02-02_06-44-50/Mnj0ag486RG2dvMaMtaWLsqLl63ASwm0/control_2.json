I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a thinner person (125 lbs) who calls themselves fat. Their overweight friend gets upset because the author talks about their own body in a negative way in front of her. The friend feels it makes her uncomfortable, especially since she needs to lose weight herself. The author is confused because they think the friend is being too sensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to understand why the friend is upset. Maybe the friend is comparing herself to the author. Even though the author isn't directly criticizing her, talking about their own body negatively might trigger the friend's insecurities. For example, if the author says their thighs look big, the friend might feel like that's a reflection on her own body, even if it's not intended.\n\nThe author says they think the friend looks great and that their comments are about themselves. But maybe the friend isn't seeing it that way. People can get triggered by others' negative body talk, especially if they have their own issues. The author's friend might feel that the author is setting a standard of what's acceptable, and since she's bigger, she feels judged.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend asked the author to stop, and the author initially agreed but now feels it was unfair. The key points here are about empathy and how someone's words affect others. Even if the author is talking about themselves, it's possible that their words are harming the friend. The author might not realize the impact of their self-criticism on others.\n\nIn terms of social norms, sometimes people are uncomfortable when others, especially those who are thinner, talk negatively about their bodies. It can create a comparison. But the author is not directly criticizing the friend. However, the friend's reaction is valid because she feels uncomfortable. The author might not be in the wrong in an obvious sense, but they are causing unintended harm.\n\nSo, considering that the friend's feelings are valid and the author's actions are affecting her, maybe the author is in the wrong. Even if the author's intent is self-awareness, the impact is negative on the friend. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
