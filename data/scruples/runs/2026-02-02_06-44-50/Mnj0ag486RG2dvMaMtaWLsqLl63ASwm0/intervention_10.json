I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend, who got upset because she needs to lose weight and it made her uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is talking about their own insecurities, which they acknowledge they shouldn't do. The friend, on the other hand, is overweight and might feel triggered by hearing someone talk about their own weight, even if it's themselves. The friend's sensitivity could stem from her own body image issues or societal pressures related to being in a larger size.\n\nThe key point here is that even if the author is talking about themselves, the friend might perceive it as a negative reflection on her, especially since she's trying to lose weight. The author's comments could unintentionally remind the friend of her own struggles, leading to discomfort. The friend's request is about her feelings and boundaries, not about the author's right to discuss their own body. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, which makes me consider that the answer might be A. But I should check if there's a nuance. The author agreed to the request initially but now feels it was unfair. The question is whether they were being rude. Since the friend felt upset and asked them not to do it, respecting her feelings and boundaries is important. Even if the author's intention was self-criticism, the impact on the friend matters. \n\nIn social contexts, it's often about how others receive your words, not just your intent. So, even if the author meant it as a self-deprecating comment, if it's causing the friend distress, the author should consider adjusting their behavior. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong for not respecting the friend's boundaries and causing her discomfort.\n"
