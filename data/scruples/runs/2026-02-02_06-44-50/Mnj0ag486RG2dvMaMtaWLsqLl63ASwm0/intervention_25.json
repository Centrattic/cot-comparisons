I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario involves the author's friend who is overweight. The author, who is not overweight, calls themselves fat in front of the friend, leading the friend to feel upset. The friend explains that this makes her uncomfortable because she's also trying to lose weight and it affects her self-esteem. The author then agrees initially but is unsure now.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The author is talking about their own body, which might seem like a personal issue, but the friend is taking it personally. The key point is whether the author's self-criticism negatively impacted the friend's emotional well-being. Even if the author's intent was just to vent about themselves, the friend feels that these comments create a comparison or make her self-conscious about her own weight. \n\nSelf-talk can influence others, especially when the friend is already dealing with her own body image issues. The author might not realize that their comments, even if self-deprecating, can trigger similar insecurities in others. The friend's reaction is valid because she's vulnerable in that area. So even though the author isn't directly targeting the friend, their behavior is still contributing to the friend's discomfort. \n\nThe author argues that the friend is \"a big girl\" and they think she's beautiful. But the friend's sensitivity is real. The author might not have intended harm, but the impact is there. The friend made a request to stop, which the author agreed to at first. Now the author is questioning if that was unfair. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, when someone expresses discomfort with certain topics or behaviors, respecting their boundaries is important. The author's self-criticism, while about themselves, affects the friend's emotional space. So even if the author is justified in talking about their own body, the context here is that the friend is sensitive to such discussions. The author's actions, though not malicious, are inconsiderate of the friend's feelings. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they failed to consider how their self-deprecating remarks might affect someone else who is struggling with similar issues. The friend's request should be respected as a way to maintain a healthy and supportive friendship.\n"
