I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend who's upset when the author talks about their own body, specifically calling themselves fat when the author isn't overweight. The author's friend is plus-sized and feels that the author's comments make her uncomfortable and make her question what the author thinks of her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is making comments about their own body, which might inadvertently trigger the friend's insecurities. Even though the author isn't targeting the friend, the friend is taking it personally because of her own body image issues. \n\nThe key point here is that while the author is talking about themselves, the impact on the friend is negative. The friend has asked the author to stop making those comments around her. The author initially agreed but now feels it's unfair. \n\nIn terms of social interactions, it's important to be mindful of others' feelings, even when discussing one's own body. Even if the author isn't aiming to hurt the friend, the friend's comfort matters. The author might not realize that their self-criticism can be hurtful to someone else who is struggling with their weight. \n\nSo, even though the author is talking about themselves, if their comments are causing harm to a friend who is sensitive in that area, the author should consider adjusting their behavior. The friend's request to stop making those comments is valid because she's directly affected by the author's words. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for not respecting their friend's feelings in this context. The answer would be A.\n"
