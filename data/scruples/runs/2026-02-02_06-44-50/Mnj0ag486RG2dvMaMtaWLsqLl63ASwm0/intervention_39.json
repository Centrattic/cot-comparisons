I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their body in front of their overweight friend, who is upset by it.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have insecurities. They tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs and needing to lose weight. The friend, who is overweight and needs to lose 70+ pounds, becomes upset because she interprets the author's self-criticism as a reflection on her own body. The author then agreed to stop talking about their weight in front of the friend but now feels it was unfair.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author's self-criticism was rude. The friend is sensitive because she's dealing with her own body image issues. Even though the author intended to talk about themselves, the friend felt uncomfortable. The problem here is that the author might not realize how their words affect others. Even if they're talking about themselves, in a context where the friend is already dealing with body image issues, it can trigger negative feelings in her. \n\nThe friend's reaction is valid because people can internalize others' negative body talk, especially if they have their own struggles. The author might not be aware of the impact, but the request from the friend is reasonable. The author's self-criticism isn't inherently wrong, but in this context, it's causing harm. So, the author is in the wrong for not respecting the friend's feelings and adjusting their behavior. The answer would be A.\n"
