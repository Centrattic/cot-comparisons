I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because she's trying to lose weight and the author's comments made her uncomfortable.\n\nSo the author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have insecurities. They mentioned their thighs looking big and needing to lose weight. The friend, who is in a plus-size store, feels that hearing the author talk about their own body makes her wonder what the author thinks of her. The author says they aren't targeting the friend and just want to express their own insecurities.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about how the author's self-deprecating comments affected their friend. Even if the author isn't directly criticizing the friend, the friend's feelings are valid. The author might not intend to hurt, but the impact is there. The friend asked them not to talk like that anymore, so the author agreeing initially but then feeling it's unfair is a conflict.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's words, even when talking about themselves, inadvertently contribute to a negative environment for their friend. The friend's discomfort is real, so even if the author didn't mean to, they might be in the wrong because their words caused harm. The author could adjust their behavior to respect their friend's feelings, even if they believe they're not at fault. So the answer is probably A (Yes).\n"
