I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author's overweight friend gets upset when the author calls herself fat. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but she has body insecurities. The friend, who is significantly overweight, feels uncomfortable when the author talks about her own weight in front of her. The friend asked the author not to do that anymore, but the author now feels it was unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is expressing her own insecurities, which is a common thing for people to do. However, the friend might be triggered by hearing someone else talk about their weight, especially if the friend is struggling with their own weight issues. The friend might feel that the author's comments are indirectly making her feel worse about herself, even if the author isn't targeting her.\n\nThe key here is about how the friend is feeling. Even if the author's intention is to talk about herself, the friend is experiencing discomfort and insecurity because of it. The author might not realize that her comments are affecting the friend negatively. The friend has the right to express her feelings and set boundaries. So, even though the author wasn't intending to hurt the friend, the impact of her words was negative. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, it's important to be mindful of others' feelings. If someone is sensitive to certain topics, especially related to body image, it's considerate to avoid those conversations around them. The author might need to adjust her behavior out of respect for her friend's feelings, even if she doesn't see it as her own problem. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though it's her own body she's talking about, her words are causing harm to her friend. It's about empathy and respecting others' emotional needs in the relationship.\n"
