I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is talking about their own body, calling themselves fat, and their overweight friend gets upset. The friend says it's rude and makes her uncomfortable because she needs to lose weight too, and it makes her wonder what the author thinks of her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of body image and how people perceive their own and others' bodies. The author is 125 lbs and doesn't think they're overweight, but they have insecurities. They tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs. The friend is in a plus-size category and is sensitive to the author talking about their own weight, which makes her feel self-conscious.\n\nSo, the key issue here is that even though the author is talking about themselves, the friend is taking it personally because of her own insecurities. The author might not be intending to hurt her, but their self-criticism is affecting the friend's feelings. The friend has asked them to stop, which is a valid request because people's feelings can be hurt even if the words are about themselves.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered insensitive to talk about your own body in a negative way around someone who might have similar issues. Even if the author is being truthful about their own insecurities, it's possible that their words are triggering the friend's own body image issues. The author might be in the wrong here because they should be considerate of their friend's feelings and adjust their behavior if it's causing harm, even unintentionally.\n\nAlso, the author says they agreed initially but then feel it's unfair. But the friend has a right to her feelings. The author could have found another way to express their insecurities without making the friend uncomfortable. Maybe they can talk about their body in a more positive light or do it in private. The fact that the friend asked them to stop suggests that the author's words were indeed affecting her negatively.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because their self-criticism, while about themselves, is causing distress to their friend who has her own body image concerns. It's important to be mindful of how our words affect others, even when talking about ourselves.\n"
