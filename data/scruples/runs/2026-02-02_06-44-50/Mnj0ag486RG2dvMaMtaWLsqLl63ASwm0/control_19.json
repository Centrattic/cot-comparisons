I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who is not overweight, calls themselves fat and talks about their body in front of their overweight friend. The friend is upset because she's trying to lose weight and it makes her uncomfortable when the author does that. The author thinks they're not being rude and that it's about themselves, but now they're questioning if it's unfair.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about how talking about one's own body image can affect others. Even if the author is being honest about their own insecurities, the friend is taking it as a reflection on herself. The author is trying to reassure the friend by saying it's not about her, but the friend's feelings are valid. \n\nI remember reading that when someone, even themselves, comments negatively about their body, it can trigger similar insecurities in others, especially if those others are already dealing with body image issues. The friend is in a situation where she's trying to lose weight, so hearing the author talk about their own weight might make her feel worse or compare herself. \n\nThe author might not have intended to hurt the friend, but the impact is there. The friend asked them to stop, and the author initially agreed but now feels it was unfair. But the question is about whether the author is wrong. \n\nSo, even if the author's comments are about themselves, the fact that it's causing the friend distress means that the author should consider their friend's feelings. It's about empathy here. The author might not be doing anything malicious, but they need to be aware of how their words affect others. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's a bit nuanced. If the friend made a request and the author agreed but then felt it was unfair, that shows maybe a lack of consideration for the friend's perspective. The author should respect the friend's feelings, even if it's about themselves. \n\nSo, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions, though self-focused, are causing harm to the friend, and the friend's request is valid. The author should adjust their behavior to respect the friend's boundaries.\n"
