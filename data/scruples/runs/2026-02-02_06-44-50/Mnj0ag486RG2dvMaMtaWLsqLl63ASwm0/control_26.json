I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their friend who is overweight. \n\nSo the situation is that the author is 125 lbs and calls themselves fat, which upsets their friend. The friend is in plus size clothing and needs to lose 70+ pounds. The friend is uncomfortable because when the author talks about their own weight, it makes her think about her own weight and feel bad.\n\nThe author says they think their friend looks great and that they're not being mean. They tried to explain it's about their own insecurities, but the friend still felt hurt. The author agreed not to talk about it, but now feels it was unfair.\n\nHmm. The key here is whether talking about one's own body in a negative way can hurt someone else's feelings, even if it's not directed at them. The author might not have intended to make their friend feel worse, but their friend's reaction is valid. People can have different sensitivities. The friend might compare herself to the author, thinking that if the author, who is thinner, is struggling with weight, then she must be even more so. That could trigger her own insecurities.\n\nThe author says they know they shouldn't talk about it, but they're asking if they were wrong. The friend felt it was rude. So even if the author's intention was to talk about themselves, if their friend is hurt by it, then maybe the author should consider their friend's feelings. It's about being considerate. The friend's request is reasonable. The author's self-criticism might be making the friend feel worse, so not talking about it could be a way to show support.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that they're just expressing their insecurities and shouldn't be blamed for that. But the friend's reaction is real. The author needs to respect the friend's boundaries. Even if the author didn't mean to, their words caused distress. So maybe the answer is A because the author should have considered their friend's feelings and respected her request, even if it's about their own body.\n"
