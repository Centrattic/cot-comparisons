I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's overweight friend gets upset when the author talks about their own body. The author tried on yoga pants, complained about their thighs and needing to lose weight, and the friend felt it made her uncomfortable because she's trying to lose weight too. The friend asked the author not to talk about weight loss around her anymore. The author agreed but now feels it was unfair.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to talk about their own body in front of the friend. The author's friend is sensitive because of her own weight issues. The key here is whether self-deprecating comments about one's own body can inadvertently hurt others. Even though the author is talking about themselves, the friend might interpret it as a negative reflection on her own body, especially if she's dealing with similar insecurities.\n\nI remember that in some cases, people can have their own body image issues and might internalize others' comments. So even if the author isn't targeting the friend, the friend's emotional state is affected. The author might not have intended to hurt the friend, but the effect is there. The friend's request is about her own comfort and mental health, so respecting that could be important. The author's argument is that it's their own body and their own insecurities, so why should the friend be upset. But the friend's perspective is valid because she's struggling with her weight and the author's comments trigger her own feelings.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't intend to hurt, but they didn't consider the friend's feelings. Maybe the author should have been more mindful. The friend is asking for support, so the author's self-deprecating remarks might not be supportive. However, the author is also trying to be honest about their own feelings. But in a close friendship, being aware of how your words affect others is important. The author could have refrained from making such comments if they knew it would upset the friend. So, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the friend's sensitivity and their own comments, even if about themselves, caused harm. The friend's request is about her emotional well-being, so the author should respect that.\n"
