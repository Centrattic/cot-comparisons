I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is talking about their body in a way that makes their plus-size friend upset. The friend says it's rude, and the author is questioning if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 125 lbs and calls themselves fat, which might not be accurate, but they have insecurities. The friend is heavier and shops in plus-size stores. When the author complains about their thighs and needing to lose weight, the friend gets upset because she's trying to lose 70 pounds and feels the author's comments make her uncomfortable. The author says they were just talking about themselves and not the friend, but the friend feels it's a comparison.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? Well, even if the author is talking about themselves, mentioning their own weight in front of someone who is struggling with weight loss could inadvertently trigger the friend's insecurities. The friend might feel that the author's self-criticism implies that being heavier is bad, which could make her feel judged or that she needs to lose weight more. The key here is that the friend's reaction is valid because she's uncomfortable with those comments, even if the author didn't mean to target her.\n\nThe author might not have intended to hurt the friend, but their actions (talking about their own body image) caused harm. The question is whether it's wrong to talk about one's own body in a way that affects others. Since the friend asked them to stop and the author agreed initially, maybe the author is in the wrong for continuing to do so. Plus, the author acknowledges that they shouldn't talk that way in general, which suggests they know it's not ideal, but maybe they didn't consider the impact on the friend.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is dealing with their own insecurities and might not realize how their words affect others. However, once the friend expressed discomfort, the author should respect that request. So even if the intention wasn't to hurt, the action did cause distress, making the author responsible. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their behavior, though self-focused, had a negative impact on the friend, and they need to be mindful of how their words affect others.\n"
