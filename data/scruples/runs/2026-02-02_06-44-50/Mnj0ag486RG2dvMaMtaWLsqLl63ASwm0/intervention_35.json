I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because the author was complaining about their thighs and needing to lose weight, even though the author is not overweight. The friend mentioned they need to lose 70 pounds and felt uncomfortable hearing the author talk that way.\n\nHmm. The author says they think their friend looks great and that it's about their own insecurities. But the friend feels triggered. So the question is: even if the author is talking about themselves, is it wrong to do so around someone who has body image issues?\n\nI remember that sometimes when people have insecurities, even if they're not the ones being spoken about, they can react to similar topics. So even if the author is being self-critical, the friend might interpret it as a reflection on herself. The author might not realize how their words affect others. \n\nThe author agreed initially but now thinks it's unfair. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. I should consider if talking about one's own body in a negative way can inadvertently hurt someone else, especially if that person is struggling with their own body image. \n\nAlso, the friend asked them not to do it anymore. Respecting others' feelings is important. Even if it's about oneself, if it's causing someone else distress, maybe the author should be more mindful. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because even though they were talking about themselves, they should consider how their friend feels. It's about being sensitive to others' vulnerabilities.\n"
