I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend, who got upset. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 125 lbs and calls themselves fat, which might not be accurate. Their friend is overweight and shops in plus-size stores. When the author complains about their thighs and needing to lose weight, the friend feels uncomfortable because she's trying to lose a lot of weight and it makes her question what the author thinks of her. The author says they don't mean to target the friend, but the friend is hurt.\n\nSo, the key points here are about body image and how self-deprecating comments can affect others. The author is talking about their own insecurities, but their friend interprets it as a reflection on her own body. Even if the author's comments are about themselves, the friend is taking it personally because of her own struggles. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author isn't necessarily being malicious. They're expressing their own insecurities, which is common. But they didn't consider how their words might impact their friend. The friend has valid feelings and asked them to stop. The author agreed initially but now thinks it's unfair. \n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were rude. Since the friend was hurt and the author's behavior, while not intended to harm, did cause discomfort, it's possible the author should have been more mindful. However, it's also a personal issue\u2014the author's right to express their own body image issues versus the friend's sensitivity.\n\nBut the friend has asked them to stop, and respecting others' boundaries is important. Even if the author feels it's unfair, they should honor the friend's request if they value the relationship. So, the author might be in the wrong for continuing the behavior after being asked to stop. However, the initial act of sharing insecurities isn't inherently wrong. But the ongoing refusal to respect the friend's feelings might tip the scale.\n\nHmm. The options are A (author in the wrong) or B (not). The friend's feelings are valid, and the author's actions, while not malicious, are causing harm. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting the friend's boundaries.\n"
