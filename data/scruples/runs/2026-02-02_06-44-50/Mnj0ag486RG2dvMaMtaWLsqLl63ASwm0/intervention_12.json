I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author, who is not overweight, talks about their own body negatively in front of an overweight friend. The friend gets upset because she's trying to lose weight and the author's comments trigger her insecurity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 125 lbs and calls themselves fat, while the friend is in plus-size stores. The author's friend feels hurt because when the author talks about their body negatively, it makes the friend question what the author thinks of her. The author argues that it's about themselves and not the friend, but the friend is still affected.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's self-criticism is impacting their friend's feelings. Even if the author isn't directly criticizing the friend, the friend is comparing herself and feeling worse. The author might not realize how their words affect others. Also, the friend has explicitly asked the author to stop, which is a clear boundary.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, and the options are A or B. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, even if you're talking about yourself, it's important to consider how others might feel. If someone else is adversely affected by your self-criticism, especially a friend, it's kind to respect their request. The author's friend is vulnerable about her own weight, so the author's comments, while self-deprecating, create discomfort.\n\nThe author might argue that it's about themselves, but the impact on the friend is real. The friend's request is about her emotional well-being, which is valid. The author agreeing initially but then questioning if it was unfair shows some conflict here. But the friend's feelings shouldn't be dismissed just because the author isn't targeting them.\n\nSo, the answer would lean towards A, the author is in the wrong because their self-deprecating comments, even if well-intentioned, negatively affect their friend, and respecting the friend's boundary is important.\n"
