I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The situation is that the friend got upset because the author complained about their body, making the friend feel bad because she's trying to lose weight too. The author feels it's unfair that the friend is upset because they were talking about themselves, not her.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: the author is not overweight (125 lbs), but their friend is. The friend is sensitive because she's trying to lose weight, and when the author talks about their own weight, it makes her feel judged. The author says they're talking about themselves, not her, but the friend still feels uncomfortable.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is whether talking about your own body in a self-critical way can be rude to someone else's feelings. Even if it's about oneself, if it triggers someone else's insecurities, does that make it wrong?\n\nOn one hand, the author is expressing their own insecurities, which is a common thing. People often talk about their own appearance. But on the other hand, the friend's reaction is valid because she's dealing with her own body image issues. Maybe the author should be more mindful of how their comments affect others, even if they're about themselves. \n\nSo, even though the author isn't targeting the friend, their words still caused distress. In that case, the author might be in the wrong because they weren't considering the friend's feelings. It's about empathy and being aware of how others might interpret or be affected by your self-talk. The friend's request is reasonable, so the author should respect that and avoid such comments around her. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their self-critical remarks negatively impacted the friend, even if unintentionally.\n"
