I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who is not overweight, calls themselves fat, which upsets their overweight friend. The friend is sensitive because she's trying to lose weight and feels uncomfortable when the author talks about their body. The author is confused because they think they're just talking about themselves, but the friend feels it's rude.\n\nHmm. So the core issue is about how talking about one's own body image affects someone else, especially a friend who has different experiences. The author is 125 lbs and uses \"fat\" in a self-critical way. The friend, who is in a plus-size category, feels that when the author criticizes their own body, it triggers her own insecurities or makes her self-conscious. \n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The friend made a request to not talk about losing weight in front of her, and the author initially agreed but now feels it was unfair. The key is whether the author's self-criticism is inherently rude or not. \n\nOn one hand, the author is expressing their own insecurities, which are valid. People often use self-deprecating humor or talk about their own bodies without intending to affect others. But on the other hand, the friend is in a sensitive position. If the author's friend is struggling with her weight, hearing someone else criticize their own body might make her feel worse about herself, even if the author is not directly targeting her.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by not respecting the friend's boundaries. The friend asked them not to do it, and the author agreed but then changed their mind. But the friend's feelings are valid here. Even if the author's intention was to talk about themselves, if it's causing harm to the friend, the author should consider that. \n\nSo in terms of answer, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't take into account the friend's feelings when discussing their own body. Even if it's about themselves, if it's making someone else uncomfortable, especially when the friend has mentioned her own struggles, the author should be more mindful. The friend's request is a boundary that the author agreed to, so maybe the author isn't in the wrong for having insecurities but is in the wrong for disregarding the friend's feelings once they were made aware of it.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the friend asked them not to do it and the author initially agreed, but then went back on it, that might make them responsible. However, the author might not have realized the impact. But since the friend communicated her feelings, the author should respect that. So the answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect the friend's request and their self-talk affected someone else's comfort.\n"
