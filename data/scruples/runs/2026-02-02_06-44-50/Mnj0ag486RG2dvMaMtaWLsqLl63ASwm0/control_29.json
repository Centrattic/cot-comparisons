I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their body when their overweight friend gets upset. So the situation is that the author, who isn't overweight, calls themselves fat in front of their friend, who is overweight. The friend feels uncomfortable because she's trying to lose weight and the author's comments make her feel judged.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about how the author's self-deprecating comments affect their friend. The author might think that talking about their own body shouldn't affect the friend, but the friend is clearly hurt. Even if the author isn't criticizing the friend directly, the friend might feel self-conscious when hearing someone else talk negatively about their own body, especially when she's in a similar situation. \n\nI remember some studies about how body shaming, even self-deprecating comments, can affect others. People might internalize those comments or feel like the speaker is indirectly commenting on them. The friend asked the author not to do it, which is a direct request. Even if the author's intention was just to vent about their own insecurities, the impact on the friend matters. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions, even if well-intentioned, caused distress. The friend's feelings are valid, and respecting her request seems important. The author might argue that it's about themselves, but if it's making the friend uncomfortable, then it's a consideration. \n\nIn terms of answer A (yes, the author is in the wrong) or B (no). The friend's discomfort is real, and the author agreed to stop initially. Maybe the author is in the wrong because they're not respecting the friend's feelings. Even if they feel it's unfair, the impact is there. So answer A.\n"
