I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because the author was complaining about their thighs and needing to lose weight, even though the author is underweight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have insecurities. The friend is in a plus-size category and is dealing with her own body image issues. When the author talks about their own body negatively, it triggers the friend's insecurities. The friend feels that the author's comments make her question how the author perceives her, leading to discomfort.\n\nThe key point here is about how the author's self-criticism affects the friend. Even though the author is talking about themselves, the friend is sensitive because of her own struggles. The author might not have intended to hurt the friend, but the impact is real. The friend asked the author to stop, and the author initially agreed but now feels it was unfair. \n\nI should consider if self-criticism in front of someone with similar or related insecurities is inherently harmful. Even if the author is being honest about their own insecurities, it can inadvertently cause others to feel judged or compare themselves. The author's friend might perceive the comments as making her feel worse about her body, even if that's not the intention.\n\nAlso, the author acknowledges that they shouldn't talk that way in general. So there's a recognition that such comments aren't ideal. The question is whether it's wrong specifically in this context. Since the friend is directly affected and asked to stop, the author's actions, though unintentional, have caused harm. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they failed to consider the friend's feelings and the impact of their words, even if it's about themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is also dealing with their own insecurities, which is valid. But the responsibility here is to the friend's feelings. Even if the author's intent was self-honesty, the friend's reaction is valid. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider how their self-deprecating comments affected their friend, leading to discomfort and a request to stop. The author's friend's feelings are legitimate, and the author should respect that boundary.\n"
