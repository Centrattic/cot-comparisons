I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So, the person is asking whether they're at fault for making their overweight friend upset by calling themselves fat. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's friend is overweight and shops in plus-size stores. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight but has body insecurities. They were trying on yoga pants, complained about their thighs, and mentioned needing to lose weight. The friend got upset because she's trying to lose 70+ pounds and felt uncomfortable hearing the author talk that way. The author tried to reassure the friend that it's about themselves, but the friend asked them to stop talking about weight loss around her. The author agreed but now thinks it's unfair.\n\nHmm. The key here is whether the author's self-criticism was inconsiderate. Even though the author was talking about their own body image, the friend might feel that such comments are triggering or make her feel worse about her own struggles. The friend is sensitive because she's dealing with a significant weight loss goal, so hearing someone thinner than her criticize their own body might make her feel that the author's criticism is a form of judgment or that the author doesn't understand her situation. \n\nBody image issues are personal, and people can have different triggers. The author might not have intended to hurt the friend, but the impact is still real. Even if the author is being self-critical, the friend could interpret it as a reflection on her or a norm that she's failing to meet. The author's friend might feel that the author's focus on weight loss in her presence is adding to her own insecurities or making her feel inadequate. \n\nThe question is whether talking about one's own body image in a way that involves weight loss is inherently rude, even when directed at oneself. Some might say that it's not the author's fault because it's their own body and they have insecurities. Others might argue that being mindful of a friend's sensitivity is important, especially if the friend has expressed discomfort. The author did agree to stop after the friend asked, but now they're questioning if that was unfair. \n\nI think the main point here is about empathy and considering how others might feel. Even if the author didn't mean to, the friend was hurt. So maybe the answer is that the author was inconsiderate, not necessarily in the wrong in a malicious way, but they should have been more aware of their friend's feelings. The friend's request is valid because her emotional well-being is affected. So the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the friend's feelings after she expressed discomfort.\n"
