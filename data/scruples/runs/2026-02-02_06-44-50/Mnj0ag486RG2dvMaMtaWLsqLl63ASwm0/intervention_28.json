I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend, who got upset.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're 125 lbs and not overweight, but have body insecurities. They tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs, wanting to lose weight. The friend, who is plus-sized, felt upset because the author's comments made her uncomfortable, making her wonder what the author thought of her.\n\nThe key here is that the friend is sensitive about her own weight and the author's self-criticism triggers her. The author argues that their comments were about themselves and not the friend. But the friend's reaction shows that the author's words affected her negatively. \n\nEven if the author wasn't directly criticizing the friend, talking about their own body in a negative way in front of someone who struggles with similar issues can be hurtful. The friend's request not to talk that way is valid because it impacts her self-esteem. The author might not have intended to hurt, but the effect is there. \n\nAlso, the author acknowledges that they shouldn't talk that way in general, which suggests they know it's not ideal. So, even if the intention was self-critique, the context and the friend's feelings matter. The author should consider how their words affect others, especially those who are vulnerable about their own body image. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A\u2014the author is in the wrong because their self-deprecating comments, while about themselves, caused distress to their friend, and they should respect the friend's feelings in this situation.\n"
