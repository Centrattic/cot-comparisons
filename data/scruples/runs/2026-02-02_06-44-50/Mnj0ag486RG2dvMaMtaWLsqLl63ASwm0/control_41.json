I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The situation is that the author is 125 lbs and feels they're not overweight, but they have insecurities. They mentioned their thighs looking large and needing to lose weight while trying on clothes. The friend, who is in a plus-size category, got upset because she needs to lose weight too and felt the author's comments made her uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is talking about their own body, which is a personal issue. But the friend is sensitive because she's dealing with her own weight issues. The friend's reaction is about her self-esteem being affected by the author's self-criticism. The author argues that their comments are about themselves and not the friend, but the friend perceives it as a comparison.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's self-criticism inadvertently harms the friend. Even if the author's intention is to talk about themselves, the impact on the friend is still valid. The friend's feelings are important, and if someone else's self-talk makes them feel worse about themselves, it's considerate to adjust that behavior. The author might not see the connection, but the friend does. So, while the author isn't intentionally being mean, their actions still have a negative effect. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's often advised to be mindful of how our words affect others, even if we're talking about ourselves. If the friend asked the author to stop, the author should respect that request, even if they don't fully agree. The author might feel it's unfair, but the friend's comfort is a valid reason. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong because their self-criticism impacts others negatively, even if unintended.\n"
