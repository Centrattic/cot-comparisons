I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation where their overweight friend gets upset when they call themselves fat. The author is 125 lbs, not overweight, but they have insecurities. The friend is in plus size stores, so she's clearly bigger. The author was shopping, tried on yoga pants, complained about their thighs and needing to lose weight. The friend got upset, said it's rude and made her uncomfortable because she needs to lose weight too. The author agreed not to talk about it, but now feels it's unfair.\n\nHmm. So the main issue is whether talking about one's own body in a negative way in front of someone else is rude, especially when that person has their own size issues. The author thinks they're not in the wrong because they're talking about themselves, but the friend felt affected by it.\n\nI remember that even self-deprecating comments can impact others, especially if they have similar insecurities. For example, if someone is struggling with their weight, hearing someone else (even if they're not in the same weight category) talk negatively about their body might trigger their own negative feelings. The author's friend might feel like the author's comments are reinforcing the idea that bigger bodies are bad, which affects her self-esteem. Even if the author is not targeted at the friend, the friend's emotional reaction is valid.\n\nBut the author argues that their comments are about themselves. However, in social interactions, how others receive the message matters. The friend felt that the author's self-talk made her feel judged or caused her to compare herself. The author's initial agreement to stop talking about it shows they acknowledged the friend's feelings, but now they're doubting it. \n\nThe key here is empathy and considering the impact on others. Even if the author's intention was self-criticism, the effect on the friend was negative. The author might not have realized how their words could be internalized by someone with body image issues. So, the author could be in the wrong for not being considerate of the friend's feelings in that context. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author is just expressing their own insecurities, it's a natural thing to do. But the friend's sensitivity is also valid. The line between self-talk and affecting others is blurry here. The author might not be in the wrong if they didn't intend to hurt, but the friend's reaction is legitimate. However, the author could be in the wrong if they should have been more aware of the friend's potential sensitivity. \n\nIn similar situations, people often find that even self-deprecating comments can create a negative environment. The friend's request to stop is a clear boundary, and the author agreed initially. The fact that the author is now questioning if the friend's request was unfair might indicate they need to respect that boundary. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because even though it's about themselves, the impact on the friend was hurtful. The answer would be A.\n"
