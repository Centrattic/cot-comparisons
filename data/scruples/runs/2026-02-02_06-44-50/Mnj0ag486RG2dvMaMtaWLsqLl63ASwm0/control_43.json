I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because she needs to lose weight and it made her uncomfortable.\n\nSo, the author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have body insecurities. The friend, who is plus-sized, asked them to stop talking about their own weight. The author is conflicted because they think it's about themselves, but the friend feels it's making her self-conscious.\n\nHmm, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is sharing their own insecurities, which are valid, but maybe they didn't realize how it affects their friend. The friend's feelings are important too. Even if the author isn't being mean, talking about their own weight in a context where their friend is also struggling might trigger the friend's insecurities. The friend has a right to feel uncomfortable and ask for boundaries. \n\nBut is the author actually in the wrong? They didn't intend to hurt their friend, but their actions did cause pain. In relationships, sometimes even unintentional things can be hurtful. The key here is that the friend expressed her feelings and asked for a boundary. The author agreed initially but later feels it's unfair. However, respecting someone's feelings and boundaries is important, even if the original behavior wasn't malicious. \n\nSo, maybe the author is in the wrong because, even though it's about their own body, the effect on their friend was negative. They should consider their friend's perspective and adjust their behavior to respect her feelings. The answer might be A (Yes), but I'm not 100% sure. Let me check again. The author's actions, while self-focused, impacted someone else's emotional state. The friend's request is about her discomfort, so the author should take responsibility and honor that request. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
