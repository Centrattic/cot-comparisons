I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author talking about their own body insecurities, which makes their overweight friend upset.\n\nSo the author is 125 lbs and calls themselves fat, which their friend is sensitive to. The friend is plus-sized and feels that the author's comments make her wonder what the author thinks about her. The author says they agreed to stop talking about weight in front of the friend but now think it was unfair.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about sensitivity and how self-deprecating comments can affect others. Even if the author is talking about their own body, the friend might take it personally, especially since she's already dealing with her own body image issues. The author's comments could inadvertently trigger the friend's insecurities. The friend has the right to express her boundaries, so she's not wrong to ask the author to stop. However, the author might feel that discussing their own body isn't about the friend. But the impact is there. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If someone's actions cause distress to a friend even if unintended, they might need to adjust their behavior. The author might not have meant to hurt the friend, but the friend's feelings are valid. So, respecting boundaries is important. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the friend's sensitivity. So the answer would be A.\n"
