I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who is not overweight, calls themselves fat in front of their overweight friend, and the friend gets upset. The friend feels that the author's self-criticism makes her uncomfortable because she's trying to lose weight. The author is confused because they think their friend looks great and that their comments are about themselves, not the friend.\n\nSo, the key points here are about how self-criticism can affect others. The friend is already dealing with body image issues and insecurities about her weight. When the author talks about their own body negatively, even if it's just self-deprecating humor or self-criticism, it might trigger the friend's own insecurities. The friend explicitly said it makes her wonder what the author thinks of her and causes discomfort.\n\nThe author argues that their comments are about themselves and that they don't mean to hurt the friend. However, the impact is still there. Even if the intention is self-criticism, the effect on the friend is negative. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by not considering how their words affect their friend's feelings.\n\nIn many cases, people's self-talk, especially about body image, can inadvertently affect others, especially those with similar or related insecurities. The friend's request was to not talk about weight loss in front of her, which the author initially agreed to. Now the author is questioning if that's unfair. But the friend's feelings are valid. The author should respect her boundaries even if they don't see the connection.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider how their self-talk affects their friend's emotional state. Even if it's about themselves, it's causing harm to the friend. The author should be more mindful of their friend's sensitivities and honor her request to avoid causing her discomfort.\n"
