I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's upset when the author calls herself fat, even though the author is not overweight. The friend is plus-sized and seems to be sensitive about the author's self-talk.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author is 125 lbs and feels insecure, so she calls herself fat. Her friend, who is overweight, gets upset because when the author talks about her own weight, the friend feels judged or uncomfortable. The author argues that her comments are about herself and not about the friend, but the friend is still hurt by it.\n\nNow, the key points here are about how self-deprecating comments can affect others, especially those with different body sizes. The author is in a position where her friend is already dealing with body image issues, possibly due to societal stigma. When the author talks about her own weight, even if it's self-deprecating, the friend might internalize that the author is implying that the friend's larger size is also a problem. This is a common issue where people with lower weight making negative comments about their own body can inadvertently hurt those with higher weight, even if the intention is to be self-deprecating.\n\nThe author says she agreed to stop talking about her weight in front of her friend but now feels it was an unfair request. However, the friend made a clear request based on her feelings. Respecting others' boundaries is important in any friendship. Even if the author feels that her comments are about herself, the impact on the friend is real. The author's self-talk might trigger the friend's insecurities or make her feel judged, even if that's not the intention.\n\nIt's also worth considering that the author's friend might be sensitive because she's in a society that often stigmatizes larger bodies. The author's comments, even if meant as a joke or self-deprecation, might reinforce negative messages the friend already hears. Therefore, the author's actions, while unintended, can be hurtful.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions crossed a boundary that her friend has set. Since the friend explicitly asked the author to stop and the author agreed, continuing to talk about her weight in that context would be inconsiderate. Even if the author believes it's about herself, the friend's feelings are valid. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because she didn't respect her friend's feelings and boundaries. The answer should be A.\n"
