I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's overweight friend gets upset when the author talks about their own weight. The author is 125 lbs and calls themselves fat, which upsets the friend who is plus-sized. The friend feels uncomfortable because the author's comments make her think about her own weight (she wants to lose 70 pounds). The author argues it's about themselves and not the friend.\n\nHmm. So, the question is, is the author in the wrong? The user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is talking about their own insecurities. On the other, the friend is hurt by those comments. Even if it's about the author's own body image, maybe it's not considerate to the friend's feelings. The friend has her own weight issues and might feel triggered by others, even if they're not the target, talking about their own weight. \n\nBut does the author have the right to express their own insecurities? The friend's request is that the author not talk about needing to lose weight in front of her. The author agreed initially but later felt it was unfair. So, the key here is whether the author's self-criticism is inherently rude, even if it's about themselves. Maybe the author isn't directly making fun of the friend, but the friend is taking it personally. \n\nI think the answer here is yes, the author is in the wrong. Because even though it's their own body, the friend is being negatively affected. The author should consider the impact of their words on others, especially a close friend who has similar insecurities. The friend's feelings are valid, and the author's self-criticism, while about themselves, is causing harm. So, the author should adjust their behavior to respect the friend's feelings.\n"
