I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who is not overweight, sometimes calls themselves fat. Their overweight friend gets upset because it makes her feel bad, as she's self-conscious about her own weight. The author argues that they were talking about themselves, not the friend, and now they think the friend's request is unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is making negative comments about their own body in front of someone who already has body image issues. Even though the author isn't the one who's overweight, their self-criticism might trigger the friend's insecurities. The friend is sensitive because she has her own weight goals and might compare herself or feel judged indirectly. \n\nThe key point is whether self-criticism is inherently rude. The friend's reaction is about her own feelings, not the author's intentions. The author might not have meant to hurt her, but if someone is uncomfortable with those comments, the speaker should be considerate. It's about empathy and respect for others' feelings. \n\nThe author says they know they shouldn't talk that way, which shows awareness of the general issue, but they're conflicted about applying that to this specific friend. The friend made a specific request, and the author agreed but now feels it's unfair. However, the request is valid because the friend is asking for support in her own journey. \n\nSo, even if the author is being honest about their insecurities, the impact on the friend matters. The author should probably respect the friend's feelings here. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong for not respecting the friend's request, even if the intent was self-deprecating. But some might argue that the author isn't in the wrong because they were talking about themselves. However, considering the friend's sensitivity and the agreement made, the answer might lean towards A (Yes).\n"
