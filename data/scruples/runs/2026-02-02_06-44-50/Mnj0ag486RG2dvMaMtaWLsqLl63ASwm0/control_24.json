I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their body in front of their overweight friend, who got upset.\n\nSo the situation is that the author, who isn't overweight, calls themselves fat and talks about needing to lose weight. Their friend, who is plus-sized, gets upset because it makes her feel bad. The author says they didn't mean to target the friend and think they look great, but the friend feels it's rude and makes her uncomfortable. The author agreed not to talk like that anymore but now feels it was unfair.\n\nHmm. The key here is about how one person's self-deprecating comments affect another person's feelings. Even if the author is talking about themselves, when someone else hears it, especially someone who is already self-conscious about their weight, it can trigger negative feelings. The author's friend might feel compared or judged, even if that's not the intention. \n\nBut the author is also dealing with their own insecurities. Is it wrong to express that, especially if it's not directed at the friend? The problem is that sometimes when people talk about their own bodies negatively, others might internalize it. The friend's reaction is valid because she's uncomfortable. The author might not have realized the impact of their words. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The friend asked them not to talk that way in front of her, and the author initially agreed. Now they're questioning if the request was fair. But maybe the friend's feelings are justified. Even if the author is talking about themselves, the effect on the friend is real. So the author might be in the wrong because their actions, even if unintended, are hurting the friend. \n\nBut then again, people have the right to discuss their own bodies, and the friend could have communicated her feelings earlier. However, once the friend expressed her discomfort, the author's continued behavior could be seen as inconsiderate. So the author's actions might be inconsiderate, but are they wrong? The line between personal expression and consideration for others is a bit blurry here. But since the friend was directly affected and asked them to stop, the author should respect that request. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
