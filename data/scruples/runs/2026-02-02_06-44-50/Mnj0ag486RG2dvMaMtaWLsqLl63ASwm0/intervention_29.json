I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's overweight friend gets upset when the author calls herself fat. The author isn't overweight, but she has insecurities and talks about her body in front of her friend, which upsets the friend. The friend feels that since she needs to lose weight, hearing the author talk about her own weight makes the friend feel self-conscious.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about how talking about one's own body image issues can affect others, especially those who might be struggling with their own body image. The author's friend is overweight and is sensitive about her own weight. When the author talks about her thighs and needing to lose weight, it makes the friend feel uncomfortable because she's comparing herself or perhaps feels judged.\n\nThe author argues that she's talking about herself, not the friend, but the friend's reaction is valid. Even if the author isn't targeting the friend, the act of body-shaming oneself can still be harmful to others. It's possible that the author's comments create an environment where the friend feels further stigmatized or judged, even if unintentionally.\n\nFrom a social perspective, it's important to be mindful of how our words affect others, especially in sensitive topics like body image. Even self-criticism can be hurtful if it's related to a trait that others might also be sensitive about. The friend's request is about her feelings, and while the author might feel it's unfair, respecting others' boundaries is crucial in maintaining a healthy friendship.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong, answer A. Because even though the author is talking about herself, her comments are causing distress to her friend who is also dealing with body image issues. The friend's feelings are valid, and the author should respect that boundary.\n"
