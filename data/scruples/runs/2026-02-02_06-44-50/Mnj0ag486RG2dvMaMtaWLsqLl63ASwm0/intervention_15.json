I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their friend who is overweight. The situation is that the friend feels upset when the author says they are fat or need to lose weight, even though the author is not overweight. The friend is bigger and has her own weight issues.\n\nHmm. So the author's friend is sensitive because when the author talks about their own body, the friend starts to compare herself to the author. The friend feels that since she needs to lose more weight, hearing the author talk about their own weight makes her uncomfortable. The author argues it's not about the friend and that they're just talking about themselves.\n\nI think the key here is how the friend feels. Even if the author's intention is to talk about themselves, if it makes the friend feel worse, then maybe the author should be considerate. The author might not realize that their comments, even if self-deprecating, can be triggering. The friend asked them not to do it anymore, so maybe the author should respect that. Even if the author feels it's unfair, the friend's feelings are valid. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
