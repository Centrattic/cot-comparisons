I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's upset when the author talks about their own weight in front of her. The author is 125 lbs and calls themselves fat, leading the plus-sized friend to feel uncomfortable.\n\nHmm. The author says they're not overweight, but they have body insecurities. The friend is plus-sized and needs to lose weight, according to her. She told the author that when they talk about their body negatively, it makes her feel like the author is judging her, even though the author claims it's about themselves.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was in the wrong by talking about their own body in a negative way in front of a friend who is also dealing with body image issues. The friend asked them not to do it, and the author is now wondering if they were wrong.\n\nI think the key points here are about empathy and how our words affect others, even if we don't intend to. The author might not see that their self-criticism could trigger or upset someone else who's struggling with their own body image. Even if the author is talking about themselves, the friend's reaction shows that it's causing her discomfort. \n\nIn situations like this, it's important to consider others' feelings. The author might not be intending to hurt, but the act of criticizing their own body can create a judgmental environment. The friend's request is about her own sensitivity, and respecting that is part of being considerate. So, even though the author is talking about themselves, their actions are impacting the friend. \n\nThe author might think it's not about the friend, but the friend's perspective is valid. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider how their words affect the friend's feelings. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they should have been more mindful of their friend's sensitivities.\n"
