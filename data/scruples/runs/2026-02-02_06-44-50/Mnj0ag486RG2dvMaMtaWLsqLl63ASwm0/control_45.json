I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is friends with someone who is overweight. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but has body insecurities. During a shopping trip, the author tries on yoga pants and complains about their thighs looking big, mentions needing to lose weight and go to the gym more. The friend becomes upset, says it's rude for the author to talk about their body in front of her because the friend needs to lose 70+ pounds, and it makes her wonder what the author thinks of her. The author reassures the friend that they're not talking about her, but the friend still asks the author not to do that. The author now feels this was an unfair request and is questioning if they were rude.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was in the wrong by talking about their own body in front of the friend. The friend is sensitive because she's dealing with her own weight issues, and the author's comments trigger her self-esteem. The author says they think the friend looks great and that their comments are about themselves, but the friend still feels uncomfortable.\n\nI remember that in many social situations, people can have different sensitivities. Even if the author isn't targeting the friend, their own body talk might make the friend feel worse about herself. The key here is that the friend expressed feeling uncomfortable and the author's behavior has a direct impact on her. Even though the author's intention was to discuss their own insecurities, the friend's reaction is valid because she interprets it as a reflection on her.\n\nAlso, the author acknowledges that the friend looks great, but the act of talking about body image issues\u2014especially in a context where the friend is aware of her own size\u2014might inadvertently make the friend feel judged. It's possible that the friend is comparing herself to the author, leading to discomfort. The author's insistence on their own intentions might not take into account the friend's emotional state.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered considerate to be mindful of others' feelings, even if you're discussing yourself. If someone is aware that their comments might cause another person emotional distress, they should adjust their behavior. The friend has asked for that consideration, so the author not honoring that could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author has a right to discuss their own body issues, especially if they're not targeting the friend. However, the context here is that the friend is particularly sensitive, and the author's actions have a clear negative impact on her. The author might not have realized the extent of the friend's sensitivity, but once made aware, continuing the behavior could be seen as neglectful.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because their actions, even if unintentional, caused distress to their friend. The friend's request is valid, and the author should respect that boundary. The answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
