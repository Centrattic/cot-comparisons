I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author calls themselves fat, which makes their overweight friend upset. The friend feels that the author's comments about their own body make her uncomfortable because she's trying to lose weight too.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about the impact of body-related comments in a friendship. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have insecurities. The friend is in a plus-size category and is trying to lose weight. When the author talks about their own body, it makes the friend feel bad because she's already dealing with her own body image issues.\n\nI need to consider if talking about one's own body in a negative way can affect others, even if the intention is just to express personal insecurities. The friend's reaction is valid because she might be comparing herself, even if the author isn't targeting her. It's a common issue where people's self-talk can influence others' self-perception.\n\nThe author argues that it's about themselves, but the friend is upset. The question is whether the author was wrong to talk about their own body in that way in front of the friend. The friend's request to stop is a clear boundary, and respecting that is important. Even if the author didn't mean to hurt, the friend's feelings are valid. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not respecting the friend's feelings and boundaries.\n\nBut then again, people have the right to express their own insecurities. However, if someone sets a boundary, it's important to honor it. The author initially agreed but now feels it's unfair. But the friend's comfort is a factor here. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't consider the impact on their friend despite knowing the friend's situation.\n"
