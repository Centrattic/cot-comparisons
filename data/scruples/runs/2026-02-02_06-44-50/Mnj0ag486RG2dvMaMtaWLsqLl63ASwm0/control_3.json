I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their body in front of their overweight friend. Let me start by breaking down the scenario.\n\nThe author is 125 lbs and calls themselves fat, which is a bit confusing since that's typically not considered overweight. They mention their friend is in plus-size stores, so the friend is definitely larger. The friend gets upset when the author comments on their own body, specifically about their thighs and needing to lose weight. The friend explains that because she needs to lose 70+ pounds, hearing the author talk that way makes her uncomfortable and makes her wonder what the author thinks of her. The author argues that they were talking about themselves and that the friend looks great, but the friend still asked them to stop. The author is now conflicted, feeling maybe the friend was unfair.\n\nHmm, the key here is whether the author's self-deprecating comments made the friend feel worse about herself. Even if the author is talking about their own issues, the friend might take it personally because she's struggling with her weight. So, even though the author isn't directly criticizing the friend, the friend's emotional response is valid. The author might not have intended to hurt her feelings, but their comments created discomfort. \n\nI need to consider if the author is in the wrong. The author's actions, though self-critical, had a negative impact on the friend. The friend's request to stop is about her own emotional well-being. The author might not be \"rude\" in a direct sense, but they are contributing to the friend's negative self-image. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't consider the friend's feelings. \n\nBut wait, the author is also dealing with their own insecurities. Should they have to suppress their own self-talk just to make others feel better? That's a bit tricky. However, in a friendship, being considerate of each other's sensitivities is important. The author could have refrained from talking about their body in the presence of someone who is sensitive to such topics. \n\nSo, even though the author wasn't targeting the friend, the impact of their words was harmful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not being mindful of the friend's feelings. Answer A.\n"
