I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The situation is about a friend who is overweight and gets upset when the author calls herself fat. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but she has body insecurities. When she was shopping and tried on yoga pants, she complained about her thighs looking big and needing to lose weight. Her friend, who is plus-size, felt uncomfortable and told her it's rude to talk about her body in front of her because it makes her wonder what the author thinks of her. The author agreed initially but now feels it was unfair.\n\nHmm. The author is questioning whether she was in the wrong. I need to think about how the friend felt. Even though the author is talking about herself, the friend might feel that the comments are inadvertently making her feel judged. The friend mentions needing to lose 70 pounds, so she's probably dealing with her own body image issues. When someone else is critical of their own body, especially in terms of weight, a friend who is also dealing with weight issues might internalize that as a reflection on themselves, even if it's not intended.\n\nThe key here is the impact on the friend. The author might not have meant to hurt her friend's feelings, but the friend was uncomfortable. The question is whether the author was being rude. Since the friend expressed that the behavior makes her uncomfortable, the author should consider her friend's feelings. Even if the author is talking about herself, the context and the friend's sensitivity matter. The author's friend might feel that such comments are part of a broader societal problem where negative body talk can affect others, especially those who are already insecure.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is dealing with her own insecurities, which is understandable. But the friend's reaction is valid because she's in a situation where she's already struggling with her weight and self-image. The author might not have realized that her self-criticism could trigger her friend's insecurities. It's about empathy and understanding the other person's perspective. So even if the author didn't intend to be rude, the action still had a negative effect, which makes her responsible for considering her friend's feelings.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because even though she's talking about herself, her comments affected her friend negatively. The friend's sensitivity is valid, and the author should respect that boundary. So the answer is A.\n"
