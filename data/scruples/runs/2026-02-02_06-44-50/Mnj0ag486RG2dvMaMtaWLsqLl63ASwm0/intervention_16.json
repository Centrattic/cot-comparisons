I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in a way that upset their overweight friend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but has insecurities. Their friend is plus-sized and shops in plus-size stores. The author was trying on yoga pants, complained about their thighs looking big and needing to lose weight, which made the friend upset. The friend thinks it's rude because she needs to lose weight too, and it makes her uncomfortable. The author agreed to stop but now feels it was unfair.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author is talking about their own body image issues, which are not related to their friend's. But the friend is sensitive because she also has her own issues. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing this.\n\nI need to consider if self-criticism (like talking about oneself being fat) can be hurtful to others, especially friends. The author is not targeting the friend but still, the friend's reaction is valid. The friend might feel that the author's comments reflect negatively on her as well, even if they're not intending to. The author says they think the friend looks great, but the friend still feels uncomfortable. \n\nIt's important to note that even if the author is not the one who is overweight, their self-deprecating comments can create a negative environment. The friend might internalize the message that being fat is bad, which affects her self-esteem. Even if the author is talking about themselves, the friend could feel judged or reminded of her own struggles, leading to discomfort. \n\nThe author's response was to agree initially but then feel it's unfair. This suggests a conflict between the author's need to express their insecurities and the friend's need for a supportive environment. The author might not realize that their comments, while about themselves, can still impact others negatively.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be in the wrong in a strict sense because they were expressing their own feelings. However, being considerate of others' sensitivities is part of being a good friend. The friend's request is reasonable because she's setting a boundary for her own comfort. The author should respect that even if they don't fully understand it. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's actions, while not directly targeting the friend, are considered rude because they made the friend uncomfortable. Since the friend explicitly said it's rude and the author's comments led to discomfort, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the friend's feelings and boundaries, even if unintentionally. But there's also a case to be made that the friend's sensitivity is valid, and the author should adjust to maintain a positive relationship.\n"
