I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because the author was discussing how their thighs looked large and needing to lose weight, which made the friend feel uncomfortable, especially since she herself needs to lose a lot of weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is not overweight, at 125 lbs, and they're talking about their own insecurities. The friend is plus-sized and sensitive about the topic. The key point is whether talking about one's own body in front of someone else who might be sensitive about the same topic is considered rude.\n\nBody image issues are personal, and people have different sensitivities. The author says they were talking about themselves, but the friend felt it was directed at her or made her feel worse. Even if the author's intention was just to express their own insecurities, the friend's reaction is valid. The friend has her own struggles with weight and body image, so hearing someone else talk about their own weight loss needs might trigger those feelings.\n\nThe author claims they didn't mean to target the friend and think she looks great. However, the friend's request is about her comfort level. The question is whether the author should respect that boundary. Even if the author's comments were about themselves, if it's causing distress to the friend, the author might need to adjust their behavior to respect the friend's feelings.\n\nBut the author argues it's unfair because they were just talking about themselves. There's a balance between personal expression and respecting others' sensitivities. The friend has the right to ask for space in her own emotional well-being. The author might not be intentionally hurting her, but the impact is real.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions are good, the fact that their words caused discomfort and the friend has a valid reason to feel that way suggests the author should comply with the request. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the friend's boundaries, even if unintentionally.\n"
