I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about the author's overweight friend getting upset when the author talks about their own body, specifically calling themselves fat. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have insecurities. The friend, who is in plus size, feels uncomfortable because when the author comments on their own weight, the friend thinks it's about her, given she needs to lose weight too.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author is talking about their own body image issues, but the friend feels triggered. The friend is sensitive because she's dealing with her own weight issues and the author's comments might make her feel judged or compare herself. The author argues that they were talking about themselves, not the friend, but the friend still feels it's rude.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's self-criticism is inappropriate in front of the friend. On one hand, the author is expressing their own insecurities, which is a personal issue. On the other hand, the friend's feelings were hurt, so the author might need to consider the impact of their words, even if they're about themselves.\n\nIn terms of social interactions, people often have different sensitivities. If someone's self-talk about their body (even if they're not overweight) affects another person who has body image issues, the speaker might need to adjust their behavior, even if unintentionally. The key here is that the friend was upset and asked the author to stop, which suggests that the author's words had a negative effect.\n\nThe author might think it's their right to talk about their own body, but in this case, the friend's comfort is also a factor. The author's initial reaction was to agree but then felt it was unfair. However, if the friend is genuinely upset, it's about respecting the friend's feelings. The author might not be \"wrong\" in a sense of malice, but in terms of being considerate, they might be in the wrong for not respecting the friend's request after being made aware.\n\nSo, considering the friend's feelings and the fact that the author was made aware of the impact, the author's continued self-criticism could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
