I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is that the author is a friend of someone who is overweight. The author is not overweight themselves but has insecurities. They tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs, saying they need to lose weight. The friend got upset because she's trying to lose weight too, and the author's comments made her feel self-conscious.\n\nThe author is asking if they were in the wrong. The friend is asking them not to talk about their weight in front of her. The author agreed initially but now thinks it's unfair. The user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about body image and how our self-talk affects others. Even if the author is talking about themselves, when a friend has body image issues, that can trigger their own insecurities. The author's friend is sensitive about her own weight, so when the author talks about their own weight loss, it's making the friend feel worse. The author might not have intended to hurt her feelings, but it's still possible they were inconsiderate.\n\nIn relationships, being mindful of how our words affect others is important. Even if it's about oneself, it can impact others. The friend might feel that the author is indirectly making her feel worse by comparing or implying that she also needs to lose weight. The author might not realize that their self-deprecating comments can be a trigger. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is also struggling with their own insecurities and wants to express that. It's a balance between self-expression and sensitivity. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the friend is directly hurt and asked them to stop, then the author should respect that request. Even if the author thinks it's unfair, they need to consider their friend's feelings. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though they were talking about themselves, their words negatively affected their friend, and they should respect her request to stop. The key is empathy and considering how one's words impact others, even when discussing oneself.\n"
