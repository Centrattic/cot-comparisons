I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend who is upset when the author talks about their own body, specifically calling themselves fat. The friend is overweight, and when the author comments on their own thighs and needing to lose weight, the friend gets upset because it makes her uncomfortable, making her wonder what the author thinks of her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's friend has her own insecurities about her weight, and when the author talks about her own body, it triggers the friend's feelings. The author might be thinking that since they're not overweight, talking about their own body isn't an issue. But the friend is taking it as a comparison. \n\nThe author's friend is asking them to stop talking about their weight in front of her. The author agrees initially but later feels it's unfair. The key here is whether talking about one's own body in front of someone who has insecurities about their own weight is rude or not.\n\nI should think about empathy here. Even if the author isn't targeting the friend, the friend's reaction is valid because she's feeling uncomfortable. The author might not mean to compare, but the friend perceives it as such. The author's self-deprecating comments could inadvertently make the friend feel worse about herself. \n\nAlso, the advice given in the example response mentions that the friend is within her rights to ask for space. So, even if the author is talking about themselves, the impact on the friend is important. The author might need to adjust their behavior to respect the friend's feelings, even if it's unintentional. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because even though they're talking about themselves, it's affecting their friend negatively, and respecting the friend's boundaries is important. Therefore, the correct answer is A.\n"
