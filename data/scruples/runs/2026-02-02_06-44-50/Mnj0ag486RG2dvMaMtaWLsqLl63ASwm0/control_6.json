I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when they talk about their own body in front of their overweight friend, who gets upset because it makes her uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, the author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have body insecurities. Their friend is in a plus-size category. The situation happened while shopping when the author tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs and needing to lose weight. The friend became upset, explained that it makes her uncomfortable because she's trying to lose 70+ pounds and feels judged. The author agreed to stop but now thinks it's unfair. The question is whether the author was wrong.\n\nHmm. The key here is about how talking about one's own body can affect others. Even if the author is talking about themselves, their friend might interpret it as a comparison or judgment, especially if she's struggling with her own body image. The friend's reaction is valid because she's in a vulnerable place. The author might not have intended to hurt, but the impact is there. Even if the author's comments are about themselves, the friend's feelings are real. So, even if the author isn't directly targeting the friend, their actions still caused discomfort. The friend's request to stop is reasonable because she's dealing with her own insecurities. The author should consider their friend's feelings, even if their own intention was positive. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because their words negatively affected the friend, even unintentionally.\n"
