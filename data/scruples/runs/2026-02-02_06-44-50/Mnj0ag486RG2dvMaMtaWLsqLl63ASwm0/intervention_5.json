I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend, which makes the friend uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they are 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have insecurities. Their friend is in plus-size stores and needs to lose 70+ pounds. The author tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs looking large and needing to lose weight. The friend got upset because she feels it makes her wonder what the author thinks about her, leading to discomfort.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's comments about their own body, the friend's emotional reaction, and the author's initial agreement but later feeling it was unfair. The author is defending that they were talking about themselves, not the friend.\n\nNow, from a social perspective, even if someone is talking about their own body image issues, it can affect others, especially if those others have their own struggles with body image. The friend's request to stop discussing this in her presence is a valid boundary. The author might not have intended to hurt her, but the impact is there. Respecting others' feelings and boundaries is important. Even if the author is not targeting the friend, their insecurities might unintentionally trigger the friend's own issues. The author's initial agreement to the request shows they acknowledged the friend's feelings, but later questioning that decision suggests a conflict between their own needs and the friend's.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider how their self-criticism might affect their friend, despite the friend's clear request. The friend's feelings are valid, and the author should respect that boundary even if it's about their own body. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
