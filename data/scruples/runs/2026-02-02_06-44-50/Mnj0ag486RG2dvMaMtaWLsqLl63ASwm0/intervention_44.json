I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their friend, who is also overweight and has body image issues.\n\nFirst, the friend got upset because the author was self-critical about their thighs and weight. The friend mentioned she needs to lose 70 pounds and that the author's comments made her uncomfortable, making her wonder what the author thinks of her. The author argues that they were talking about themselves, but the friend felt targeted.\n\nNow, the key here is whether talking about one's own body in a negative way can affect others. Even if the author's comments were about themselves, the friend might feel sensitive because of her own weight issues. It's possible the author's self-criticism triggered the friend's insecurities, making her feel judged or leading her to compare herself. \n\nThe author acknowledges that they shouldn't talk that way in general, which shows some self-awareness. However, the friend explicitly asked them to stop, and the author initially agreed. Now, the author is questioning if the friend's request was fair. \n\nFrom a social perspective, comments about body image, even if directed at oneself, can create a negative environment for others with similar issues. It's about empathy and considering how others might feel. The author might not have intended to hurt the friend, but the impact is real. So, even if the author's intent was self-criticism, the effect on the friend was negative. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the friend's feelings and the potential impact of their words. The friend's request is valid because she's in a vulnerable position, and the author's self-deprecating remarks could exacerbate her insecurities. It's about mutual respect and being mindful of how our words affect others, even when they're about ourselves.\n"
