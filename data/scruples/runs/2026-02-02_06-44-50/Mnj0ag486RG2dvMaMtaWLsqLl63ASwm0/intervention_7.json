I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend, who found it upsetting.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author is 125 lbs and has insecurities. They tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs and needing to lose weight. The friend, who is overweight and needs to lose 70+ pounds, got upset because she felt the author's comments made her uncomfortable. The friend thinks it's rude for the author to talk about their body in front of her. The author now questions if agreeing to stop was unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to talk about their own insecurities, not to judge the friend. But the friend's reaction is valid because she might feel sensitive about her own weight. Even if the author's comments were self-deprecating, the friend could interpret it as a comparison or a reminder of her own struggles. \n\nThe key here is about empathy and how our words affect others. While the author isn't directly criticizing the friend, talking about their own body image issues in front of someone who has different challenges could unintentionally trigger feelings of insecurity in the friend. The friend has a right to set boundaries for her own comfort. \n\nThe author might argue that it's natural to discuss personal insecurities. However, being mindful of a friend's sensitivities is important in maintaining a supportive relationship. The fact that the friend asked the author to stop suggests that her feelings were hurt, even if unintentionally. \n\nSo, even if the author's intent was innocent, the impact on the friend matters. The author could have refrained from such discussions in that context to respect the friend's feelings. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider how their self-talk affected their friend's emotional state.\n"
