I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because the author was complaining about their thighs and needing to lose weight, and the friend feels it makes her self-conscious since she has her own weight issues.\n\nFirst, the author is talking about their own body image, which is a personal issue. But maybe the friend is sensitive because she's dealing with similar or different body image concerns. The author mentions they are 125 lbs and not overweight, while the friend is in plus-size stores. The author's friend might feel that the author's comments are making her feel worse about her own body, even if the author's comments are about themselves. \n\nBody image issues can be really sensitive. Even if the author is talking about themselves, the friend might interpret it as a reflection on her own body. The friend's reaction seems to be that she feels uncomfortable and thinks the author's talk about weight is rude. The author might not have intended to hurt the friend, but the effect is there. \n\nThe key point here is whether talking about one's own body in a negative way can affect others. The author's friend is taking it personally, which is a valid reaction given her own insecurities. The author might argue that it's about themselves, but the friend is clearly affected. So, even if the author didn't mean to, their words had a negative impact. \n\nThe author says they agreed not to talk about it, but now they think it's unfair. But the friend's feelings are valid, so maybe the author should respect her request. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is causing harm unintentionally, then they might be in the wrong because they should consider the impact on their friend. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, are still causing harm. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
