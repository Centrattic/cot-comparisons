I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who is not overweight, calls themselves fat in front of their overweight friend, and the friend gets upset. The friend is sensitive because she also needs to lose weight, and hearing the author talk about their own weight makes her feel self-conscious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their friendship. The author mentions that they are not overweight (125 lbs), but still have body insecurities. They try on yoga pants and complain about their thighs, leading to the friend feeling upset. The friend thinks talking about weight in front of her is rude because she's struggling with her own weight loss goals.\n\nThe author argues that their comments were about themselves, not the friend, and that they told the friend she looks great. But the friend still feels uncomfortable. Now the author is questioning whether they were in the wrong.\n\nFrom the friend's perspective, it's possible that hearing someone else talk about their weight, even if it's themselves, could trigger insecurities, especially if the friend is already dealing with body image issues. The friend might feel that the author's comments create an environment where weight is a sensitive topic, making her feel judged or that her own weight is being implied negatively.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that they should be able to discuss their own insecurities without feeling guilty, especially since they are not the one who is overweight. The author also mentions that they acknowledge their friend looks great, so their intent wasn't to criticize her.\n\nBut the key here is about the impact of the author's words, not just the intent. Even if the author's comments were about themselves, the friend's reaction shows that it affected her negatively. The friend has made a request to stop talking about weight in front of her, so respecting that boundary is important in a friendship. The author agreed initially but now feels it's unfair. However, if the friend's feelings are genuine and valid, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her feelings and the request.\n\nIn terms of social norms, sometimes even self-deprecating comments can be hurtful to others, especially if they have similar insecurities. The author might not have intended harm, but the result was causing discomfort. So, the author's actions, while not malicious, could be considered rude because they didn't consider the friend's sensitivity in that context.\n\nTherefore, considering the friend's feelings and the impact of the author's words, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
