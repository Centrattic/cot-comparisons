I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who is not overweight at 125 lbs, calls themselves fat in front of their overweight friend. The friend gets upset because she's trying to lose weight and it makes her uncomfortable when the author talks about their own weight. The author thinks they're not in the wrong and maybe the friend is being too sensitive.\n\nHmm. So, the key points are about body image and how our self-talk affects others. The author is talking about their own insecurities, but the friend is taking it personally because she's dealing with her own weight issues. The question is whether the author was rude by discussing their own body negatively in front of her.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics of their friendship. The friend is explicitly saying that the author's comments make her uncomfortable because she's comparing herself, even though the author is trying to say it's about themselves. The author might not realize how their words can trigger others. Even if the author's intention is to express their own insecurities, the impact on the friend is negative. \n\nIn social interactions, sometimes we have to be mindful of how our words affect others, even if they're about ourselves. The friend is being honest about her feelings, and the author is now questioning if the friend was right to ask them to stop. The author might be thinking that since it's their own body, they can talk about it as they want. But if it's causing the friend distress, there's a responsibility to consider that. \n\nThe answer here might be about empathy and communication. The friend asked the author to stop, which is a valid request. The author agreed initially but then changed their mind. The key is whether the author's self-criticism in front of the friend was inconsiderate. Since the friend is in a sensitive situation, the author's comments could be adding to her own insecurities. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because even though they were talking about themselves, their words had a negative effect on their friend. The friend's feelings are valid, and the author should have been more considerate of how their self-talk impacts the friend.\n"
