I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because when the author mentions needing to lose weight, the friend feels it's a reflection on her, since she also needs to lose weight. The author argues that their comments were about themselves and not the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their friendship. The author is not overweight, but feels insecure. Their friend is in a plus-size category. When the author talks about their own weight, the friend might feel that the author is implying that being heavier is undesirable. This could make the friend feel judged, even if the author's intention was just to express self-doubt. \n\nThe friend's reaction is valid because people who are already dealing with body image issues might be sensitive to others discussing weight, even if it's not directed at them. The author's friend might feel insecure or compared to the author, leading to discomfort. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have intended to hurt the friend. They mentioned they think the friend looks great and that the comments were about themselves. However, intentions don't always align with impacts. The key here is whether the author should have been aware that their comments could affect the friend negatively. \n\nIn social interactions, it's important to consider how others might perceive your words. Even self-critical comments can be read differently when someone else is struggling with similar issues. The author's friend felt it was rude, so the author might need to respect that boundary, even if they don't see the problem. \n\nThe author agreed initially to stop making those comments but now feels it was unfair. But in a healthy relationship, respecting the friend's feelings and boundaries is crucial. The author could work on self-acceptance to reduce the need to express self-criticism, which in turn might help the friend feel less affected. \n\nSo, while the author might not have malicious intent, their actions still hurt the friend. The wrong here is more about not being considerate of how their self-talk affects others. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
