I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their body in front of their overweight friend, who got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 125 lbs and calls themselves fat, which is probably not accurate since they're not overweight. Their friend is plus-sized and shops in plus-size stores. When the author talks about their own body negatively, the friend gets upset because she's trying to lose weight and the comments make her self-conscious. The author says they agree to stop but now feel it was an unfair request.\n\nSo, the question is about whether talking negatively about one's own body in front of someone who is self-conscious about their weight is rude. The friend is sensitive because she's dealing with her own weight issues, so the author's comments might trigger her insecurities. Even though the author is talking about themselves, the friend perceives it as a comparison or criticism, leading to discomfort.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, it's important to consider others' feelings. Even when talking about oneself, the impact on others matters. The author's friend felt that the author's self-criticism made her think about her own weight in a negative way. The author might not see it as a comparison, but the friend does. So, even if the author is not being mean, the effect on the friend is negative. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they agreed to stop, which shows they recognized the friend's feelings. But now they feel it was unfair. This conflict between personal expression and others' sensitivities is tricky. However, in social interactions, respecting others' boundaries is usually necessary. If the friend asked them to stop, respecting that request is key to maintaining the relationship.\n\nTherefore, even if the author's intention was harmless, the act of continuing to self-criticize in a way that upsets a friend could be considered inconsiderate. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation. Since the friend's feelings are valid, and the author's actions caused discomfort, the answer is likely A (Yes).\n"
