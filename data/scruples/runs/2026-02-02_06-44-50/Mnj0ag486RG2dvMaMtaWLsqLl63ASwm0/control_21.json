I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend, who got upset.\n\nSo the situation is that the author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have insecurities. Their friend is in plus-size stores. The author tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs and needing to lose weight. The friend felt upset, saying it's rude because she needs to lose weight too and it makes her uncomfortable. The author thinks they're not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is talking about their own body image issues, but their friend is dealing with her own weight issues. The friend might feel that the author's negative self-talk mirrors her own struggles, making her feel worse. Even though the author is not the one who is overweight, their comments could trigger the friend's insecurities. \n\nThe key point is that body image issues can be sensitive for people around them. Even if the author isn't criticizing the friend, talking negatively about their own body in front of someone who's dealing with similar issues can be hurtful. The friend might feel judged or like the author is making a comparison, even if that's not the intention.\n\nThe author agreed initially but now feels it's unfair. But from the friend's perspective, she's asking for support in her own journey. The author's self-criticism might not be directly about the friend, but it can still affect her emotionally. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's about empathy here. Even if the author is talking about themselves, they should consider how their words impact others. The friend's reaction is valid because she's dealing with her own body image issues. The author's self-deprecating comments might not be helpful to her. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because their comments, while about themselves, caused distress to a friend who is sensitive to body image issues. The author should be mindful of how their self-talk affects others, especially those with similar or related insecurities.\n"
