I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own weight in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because she thought the author was comparing her to her own weight, making her uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they are 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have insecurities. They tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs, wanting to lose weight. The friend, who is plus-sized, felt that this made her wonder what the author thought of her, leading to discomfort.\n\nThe key points here are about body image and how comments about one's own body can affect others. The author's friend is sensitive about her weight and the author's self-criticism might inadvertently make her feel judged, even if the author's intentions were purely self-focused. \n\nIn situations like this, it's important to consider others' feelings, even if the intention is not to hurt. The friend made it clear that these comments upset her, so the author needs to respect her feelings. While the author might not be in the wrong in a direct sense (since they were talking about themselves), their actions still caused distress. Therefore, the author should adjust their behavior to be considerate of their friend's sensitivity.\n\nSo the answer would be A, since the author's self-criticism, while their own business, can have an impact on the friend's emotions, and they should heed their friend's request to avoid causing further discomfort.\n"
