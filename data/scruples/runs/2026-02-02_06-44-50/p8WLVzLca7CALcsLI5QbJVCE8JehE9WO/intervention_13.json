Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a surprise two-week trip to Switzerland, using leave that the author hadn't applied for. She spoke to their boss without the author's knowledge. The author is upset because he feels this is unprofessional and could affect his career. He didn't want to use his leave for an overseas trip and preferred to relax at home. The girlfriend is annoyed, and his friends say he's ungrateful.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girlfriend made decisions without consulting him, used company resources (boss's approval for leave), and the author feels this was a major overstep. The author is now refusing the trip, which the girlfriend paid for, possibly leading to cancellation fees.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: He didn't want to take a vacation that wasn't his choice. Using leave without consulting him is a big deal. His job is important, and having his boss involved without his consent might be seen as a risk. Plus, he prefers to relax at home, not travel. So, he's not ungrateful for the gesture, but he's standing by his personal preference.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective: She did something nice for him on his birthday, surprising him. She took the initiative, maybe thinking he would love the trip. She might feel hurt or unappreciated when he refuses. She might not see the professional aspect as a big issue, especially if she was told to keep it secret and the boss approved.\n\nThe friends are saying he's ungrateful. But is that fair? Gratitude is about appreciating the effort, but the author's issue is more about the method and lack of consent rather than not valuing the gift. He's not rejecting the gesture per se, but the way it was done and the implications for his job.\n\nThe author's main arguments: Unprofessional risk, lack of prior discussion, and personal preference. The girlfriend's arguments: Thoughtful surprise, maybe trying to create a good experience, assuming he would like it.\n\nIs it wrong for the author to refuse? Well, he has the right to make his own decisions about his time and career. The girlfriend overstepped by making unilateral decisions, especially involving their employer. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing his job and his own preferences. The friends might be wrong to label him ungrateful when he's actually being practical and standing up for his boundaries.\n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. The author could express gratitude for the thought but explain his reasons. However, he did refuse, which might have been a harsh reaction. But given the circumstances, it's understandable. The girlfriend should have discussed this with him first.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend made a mistake by not consulting him and involving their boss without his input. The author is justified in refusing because it's his leave and his career. So the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
