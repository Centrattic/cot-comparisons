Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend surprising her boyfriend with a paid-for vacation to Switzerland, but he's upset because she didn't consult him and involved their boss without permission.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend paid for the trip, which is a nice gesture, but the key issue here is the lack of communication. The boyfriend feels that she should have asked him before making such a big decision. He's concerned about professional implications because they work in the same company and different branches, reporting to the same boss. Using company leave for a couple's trip might be seen as unprofessional, especially if they didn't coordinate properly.\n\nThe girlfriend did talk to their boss months in advance without the boyfriend's knowledge. That could be problematic because taking leave without the employee's consent is a big deal. The boyfriend might feel his autonomy is violated. He prefers to use his leave time to relax and sleep, which is a valid preference. The girlfriend's surprise didn't consider his personal preferences, which is a point in his favor.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was to do something nice. She might not have realized the potential professional issues or the importance of discussing with him first. Friends are telling him he's being ungrateful, but gratitude doesn't mean you have to accept something against your will or preferences.\n\nLegally and ethically, using company leave without the employee's consent isn't right. The girlfriend's action might have crossed a line by involving their boss without the boyfriend's input. The boyfriend's refusal isn't just about the trip but also about the lack of respect for his autonomy and professional boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all aspects, the boyfriend is justified in his stance. He's not in the wrong because his main issue is the lack of communication and respecting his choices, which are valid concerns.\n"
