Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid by his girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a surprise trip to Switzerland, got their boss's approval months in advance, and paid for everything. The author didn't know about it until he got the envelope. He's upset because he didn't ask for leave and didn't want to go on an overseas trip. He wanted to relax at home instead. The girlfriend is upset because he's not happy, and friends say he's ungrateful.\n\nSo, the main points are: Did the girlfriend overstep by not consulting him about the trip and using company leave? Did the author have a right to refuse? \n\nThe girlfriend's actions: She used their mutual boss to get leave approved without telling him. It's possible that this could be unprofessional, especially if the company has policies about taking leave, especially for couples. The author is concerned about jeopardizing his career. Also, she made a decision that affects him without asking, which is a big deal. \n\nThe author's perspective: He didn't want to go on the trip, prefers to relax. He's not happy that she didn't ask him first. He's worried about professional implications. Friends are telling him to be grateful, but he feels his wishes were ignored.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the girlfriend made a decision that impacts him financially and professionally without consulting him. Even if the trip was paid for, using company leave (especially if it's for two weeks) without his input is a problem. The author's right to his own time and preferences is valid. Also, the girlfriend shouldn't have assumed he wanted the trip. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a cultural or company norm about such things. If using leave for a trip is acceptable, maybe the girlfriend's action is okay. But the key issue is that she didn't ask him. The author is within his rights to refuse because it's his leave and his preference. Also, the fact that he didn't act enthused because he wasn't interested in the trip is understandable. \n\nThe friends' advice that he's being ungrateful might be missing the point. Gratitude is separate from personal preferences. He's not ungrateful for the effort and money, but it's not something he wants. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B). The girlfriend made a unilateral decision affecting him, which is a breach of communication and respect for his preferences. His refusal is justified because he didn't want to go, and he has valid concerns about how the leave was secured without his input.\n"
