Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by their girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland, got the flights, and even talked to their mutual boss months ahead to arrange leave. The key points here are that the girlfriend didn't consult the author about the trip, used company leave which might be unprofessional, and the author feels it's not something that should be done without his consent.\n\nThe author is upset because the girlfriend didn't ask him first. He prefers to use his leave time to relax and sleep. The girlfriend had already paid for everything, including ski resorts, so returning the tickets would cost her money. Friends think he's being ungrateful.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. To decide, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend did plan something nice, but she didn't consider his preferences and used company resources in a way that could be unprofessional. The author's main issue is that his preferences weren't respected. He didn't want to travel overseas, so the surprise was not aligned with his wishes. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was to do something nice for his birthday. However, by not consulting him, she made a decision that affects both their schedules and could impact their work. The fact that they report to the same boss adds a layer of potential professional risk if the leave wasn't properly handled.\n\nThe author's refusal is based on not wanting to go on the trip and feeling that consent was needed. His friends say he's ungrateful, but maybe they're not seeing the lack of communication and the professional implications. \n\nI think the main issue is about consent and respecting each other's preferences. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him first. The author isn't wrong for objecting because his autonomy and preferences matter. He's not being ungrateful; he's standing up for his personal choice. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
