Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend surprised him with a paid vacation to Switzerland. The key points are: she arranged this without consulting him, used their boss to secure leave, and he's upset because he didn't agree to it and prefers relaxing at home.\n\nFirst, the author is annoyed because his girlfriend didn't ask him first. That's a valid point. When someone makes a big decision like booking a trip that uses his vacation days, especially involving work, not discussing it beforehand could be an issue. He might feel disrespected or that his preferences were ignored.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend did plan this as a surprise, which people often do in relationships to show love. She might have thought it's a special way to celebrate his birthday. However, coordinating with their boss without his knowledge could be seen as overstepping. Using work leave for personal reasons without the employee's consent might be risky for the author's career, which he's pointing out. Also, he mentioned he would prefer to relax and sleep, which is a legitimate personal preference.\n\nThe friends think he's ungrateful, but being given a gift he didn't want might not be gratitude. The author's main issue is the lack of communication and consultation. Even if the intention was good, not considering his feelings or preferences might be the problem. \n\nBut then again, sometimes surprises can be over-the-top and not consider the other person's actual wants. The girlfriend's actions might have been well-meaning but not well-considered. The author had a right to his own feelings about the trip. So he's not wrong for standing up for himself. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong for refusing. If he had a valid reason not to go and the trip was imposed without his consent, then he's justified. However, if the surprise was meant to be a gesture and he refused without considering the effort she put in, maybe he's at fault. But the key here is that she didn't check with him. So maybe the girlfriend should have asked first. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's stance is about respecting his autonomy and preferences. He's not wrong for being upset and refusing the trip. The girlfriend's mistake was not communicating with him. Therefore, the answer would be B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
