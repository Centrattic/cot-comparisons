Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid by his girlfriend. The scenario is that the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland, got leave from their boss without asking him, and he's upset about it. He's worried about professional repercussions and didn't want to go on an overseas trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's intention was to give a surprise gift, which is a nice gesture. She went to the effort of coordinating with their boss, which might have taken time and planning. She might feel hurt or disappointed that he's not excited and that he's refusing.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about professional boundaries. Asking their boss for couples' leave could be seen as unprofessional, especially since they work in different departments but report to the same boss. There's a risk of favoritism or misuse of company resources. Also, he didn't get to choose or agree to the trip, which is a valid point. Autonomy in personal decisions is important, and he prefers to use his leave for relaxation rather than travel.\n\nThe key issues here are consent and professional conduct. The girlfriend made a decision without consulting him, which is a problem because he didn't want to go. Even though she paid for everything, the fact that she didn't ask first is a major issue. He's right to express that he doesn't want to go, especially since it's his leave time. His friends think he's being ungrateful, but his reasons are legitimate. The girlfriend's action might have overstepped by not respecting his autonomy.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's justified in his refusal because he didn't agree, and his concerns about professional boundaries are valid. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him before making arrangements. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
