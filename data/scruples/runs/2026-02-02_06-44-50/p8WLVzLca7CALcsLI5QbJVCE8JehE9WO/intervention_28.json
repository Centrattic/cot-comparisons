Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. The author's main points are that the girlfriend arranged the trip without asking him, involved their boss without his consent, and he prefers to use his leave time to relax and sleep. The girlfriend had planned this for months, and the author is upset about the professional implications and lack of consultation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's intentions. She wanted to do something special for his birthday, which is a common gesture. She went ahead and planned the trip, using their boss. The author feels that asking their boss about leave for a couple's trip is unprofessional. But in some companies, especially if they report to the same boss, maybe they have a policy that allows such leave. However, arranging it without the employee's input could be a problem.\n\nThe key issue here is consent. The author states he wasn't consulted. Even though the girlfriend paid for it, the fact that he didn't agree to the plan might make it an issue. The author has the right to decide how he uses his leave time. If he doesn't want to travel, especially internationally, that's his choice. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him first. \n\nThe author's friends say he's ungrateful, but gratitude isn't the same as obligation. The girlfriend should have asked him before making plans. The author's refusal is based on professional concerns and personal preference, which are valid. He's also considering the financial aspect by not wanting her to face cancellation fees, which shows he's trying to be thoughtful.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions might stem from good intentions, wanting to celebrate his birthday. But crossing the line into making decisions without his input, especially involving their boss, could be problematic. The author has the right to his own schedule and career considerations.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong because he's asserting his right to make decisions about his own leave and his career, and he communicated his reasons clearly. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him first. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
