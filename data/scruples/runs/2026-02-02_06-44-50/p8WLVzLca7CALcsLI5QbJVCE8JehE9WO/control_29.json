Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid by his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland without consulting him. She informed their mutual boss in advance, which the author finds unprofessional. He's concerned about how taking this leave might affect his career since they're in the same company but different branches. Also, he didn't want to go on an overseas trip and would prefer to relax and sleep instead. He mentioned he didn't act enthusiastic, which upset her, and friends think he's being ungrateful.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girlfriend made a big decision without his input, used company resources (telling their boss), and now he's refusing. The author's main issue is that she didn't ask him first. The question is whether he's in the wrong for refusing.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, major decisions involving both partners' time and employment should be discussed. By not consulting him, she might have overstepped. The author's concerns about professionalism and personal preference are valid. He's not obligated to accept a surprise that doesn't align with his wishes. However, the girlfriend might have felt her surprise was a nice gesture, but she should have checked with him first.\n\nThe friends saying he's ungrateful might be right in the sense that he's rejecting a gift, but if the method of giving the gift was problematic, then he's justified. It's a balance between appreciation and personal boundaries. Since the author clearly communicated his issues (not wanting to use leave for travel, unprofessional approach), his refusal is based on valid reasons. The girlfriend should have considered his preferences and professional concerns. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
