Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend planned a surprise vacation for their birthday, using company leave without asking him first. The author is upset because they think it's unprofessional to tell their boss about the trip, plus he didn't get a say. The girlfriend paid for everything already, so he's conflicted about canceling and making her lose money.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend did a surprise, which is a nice gesture, but maybe she didn't consider his preferences. The author feels it's unprofessional because they have to use company leave, which might look bad if their boss knows they're taking time off for a vacation. Also, he didn't want to go on an overseas trip and would prefer to relax at home. The girlfriend paid for everything, so he's worried about her losing money if he cancels.\n\nThe author's main points are: he wasn't consulted, the use of leave is unprofessional, and he doesn't want to travel. The girlfriend's actions might have been well-intentioned, but she didn't check with him first. In relationships, communication is key. Even though it's a surprise, respecting each other's preferences is important. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the girlfriend's surprise was a thoughtful gesture, and the author is being ungrateful by not going. But if he genuinely doesn't want to go and has valid concerns about professionalism, then it's his right to refuse. The fact that the girlfriend didn't ask first is a problem because it disregards his autonomy. So, he's not necessarily in the wrong for not going. He's standing up for his boundaries. On the other hand, maybe he could have handled it more sensitively to avoid hurting her feelings. \n\nBut the core issue is whether he's in the wrong. Since the girlfriend didn't seek his input and he has legitimate reasons to refuse (professional concerns and personal preference), he's not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
