Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the girlfriend planned a surprise vacation, paid for it, and told the author's boss in advance to get time off. The author is upset because he wasn't consulted and felt it's unprofessional to use company leave for a vacation, especially since they work in different departments and report to the same boss. He prefers to use his time to relax and sleep instead of traveling. The girlfriend is annoyed, and friends say he's being ungrateful.\n\nFirst, the main points of contention: the girlfriend made a surprise without checking with him, involved their boss which might be unprofessional, and the author feels it's his time off to use as he likes. The girlfriend might have overstepped by not getting his input and by coordinating with the boss without his knowledge. \n\nThe author's reasons for refusing are valid. He didn't ask for the trip, and using company leave for a personal trip could be a professional risk. Also, he has his own preferences about how to spend his time off. However, the girlfriend did spend money on the trip, and the author didn't express his concerns until after she had already planned everything. Maybe he could have communicated his feelings earlier. But did he do something wrong by not going? \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have assumed he would be happy, and the surprise was meant to be a gift. The author's refusal could be seen as ungrateful, especially since the tickets are already paid for and changing them would cost money. But the author's right to his own time off is also a factor here. \n\nI think the key issue is whether the girlfriend should have asked him first. Since it's his leave time and involves work, she should have consulted him. The author's refusal is about respecting his personal choices and professional boundaries. However, by not being more enthusiastic and immediately refusing, he might have hurt her feelings. But is that his fault? He has the right to say no, but maybe he could have handled it more kindly. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he has the right to his time and the situation involves professional risks. However, the way he responded might have been abrupt. The girlfriend also made a mistake by not checking with him. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't go along with the trip and expressed his reasons, which are valid, I think the answer is B (No).\n"
