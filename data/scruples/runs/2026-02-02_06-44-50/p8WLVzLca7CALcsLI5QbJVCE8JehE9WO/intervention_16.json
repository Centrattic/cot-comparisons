Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend planned a surprise vacation for his birthday, using company leave that she arranged without his consent. The author is upset because he didn't agree to the trip and prefers to use his leave time to relax and sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's intention was to surprise him with a gift, which she paid for, including flights and resorts. She coordinated with their boss, which the author finds unprofessional. He's upset because he wasn't consulted and the arrangement could risk his job. He also mentions preferring his own plans for the leave.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, surprises can be nice, but they should ideally consider the other person's preferences. The girlfriend didn't check if he wanted the trip, which is a key point. However, she went through the trouble of planning and paying, which might make her feel hurt when he refuses. The author's friends think he's ungrateful, but is that fair?\n\nLegally and ethically, using vacation days is the employee's choice. The girlfriend arranging leave without his input might be overstepping, especially since he didn't agree. The company's policies might also play a role here\u2014using leave for personal reasons should be the employee's decision.\n\nSo, the author's main issue is autonomy over his leave and being consulted. The girlfriend's action, while well-meaning, disregarded his preferences. Therefore, he's not in the wrong for wanting to refuse. The answer is B.\n"
