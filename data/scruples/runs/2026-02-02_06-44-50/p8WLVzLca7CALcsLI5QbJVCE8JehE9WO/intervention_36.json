Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a surprise vacation paid for by the girlfriend. The author feels that the girlfriend acted without consulting him, especially regarding using his leave time, which is a professional concern. He refused to go, and now she's upset, with friends saying he's ungrateful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The girlfriend planned a surprise trip, securing leave without the author's input. The author is concerned about the professional implications of taking couples' leave, which he feels is unprofessional. He didn't want to take the time off for a vacation and prefers relaxation at home. \n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend did something nice, surprising him with a trip, which required effort and money. She talked to their boss in advance, which might have been to ensure approval. The author's issue is that she didn't ask him first. On the other hand, the girlfriend made a decision that affects both their personal and professional lives without discussing it with him. The author's job is important, and using leave for a trip could have career implications. \n\nThe key here is consent and communication. The girlfriend's action was well-intentioned but didn't consider his preferences. The author has a valid point about needing to discuss such a significant decision together. However, the girlfriend's perspective is that she was trying to make his birthday special. The friends' reaction is that he's being ungrateful, which might be true if he's dismissing her effort without understanding her intent. \n\nBut the author's main argument is about the professional aspect and not wanting to take the trip. Is it wrong to prioritize his job concerns over a surprise gift? The girlfriend didn't consult him, which is a relationship issue. In relationships, big decisions should be mutual. So, the author's refusal isn't about the gift itself but about the lack of communication and the professional risk. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend didn't involve him in a decision that affects both their personal and professional lives. However, there's nuance. The author could have expressed his concerns more diplomatically instead of flatly refusing. But the core issue is the lack of prior discussion, which the author is right to point out. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
