Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend planned a surprise vacation to Switzerland using their company's leave, and the author refused to go because he didn't agree with the arrangement and felt it was unprofessional.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The girlfriend planned the trip, talking to their common boss in advance to secure the leave. She probably thought it was a thoughtful surprise for his birthday. On the other hand, the author didn't approve of the trip because he wanted to use his leave to relax at home, and he felt it was unprofessional to take couples' leave without discussing it first. He also didn't want to travel overseas.\n\nThe author's main arguments are about not being asked first and the unprofessionalism of coordinating leave with their boss without his input. The girlfriend might feel hurt that he didn't appreciate the gesture, especially if she put in the effort and money. The author's friends say he's being ungrateful, which adds another layer.\n\nI need to consider communication in relationships. The girlfriend didn't consult him before making the plans, which is a problem. However, the author didn't express his preferences beforehand either. If he had mentioned that he prefers not to travel, maybe she wouldn't have proceeded. But since she did, he's in a position where he's rejecting a surprise he didn't agree to.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. Did the girlfriend overstep by making a big decision without his input? Yes. But the author also didn't communicate his travel preferences. However, the girlfriend's action was a surprise, which might be seen as a nice gesture, but the lack of consultation is a major issue. The author's refusal is based on valid reasons related to his personal preferences and professional concerns. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to discuss big plans together, especially when they involve work and finances. The girlfriend's approach might have been well-intentioned, but it's not respectful to make such a decision without the other person's input. The author's stance is about autonomy and respecting each other's boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for refusing a trip that was arranged without his consent. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him first. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
