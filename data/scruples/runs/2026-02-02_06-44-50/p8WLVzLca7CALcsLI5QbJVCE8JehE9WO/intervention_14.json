Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend organized a two-week trip to Switzerland without consulting him. She talked to their boss months in advance to secure leave, which they both report to. The author is upset because he thinks using work leave for a couples' trip is unprofessional and could jeopardize his career. Plus, he prefers to relax at home instead of traveling. He didn't want to go, so he told her he'd refuse, leading to her being annoyed.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's perspective, she spent a lot of money and effort planning this. She might feel hurt that he's not appreciative. But the author's main point is that she didn't ask him first. In relationships, mutual respect is important. Decisions that affect both partners, especially those involving work leave and finances, should be made together. She used his leave without his input, which he sees as a breach of trust or lack of communication.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought she was surprising him and making his birthday special. Maybe she thought he'd like a trip, not realizing his preference for relaxation. However, the key issue is not the surprise itself but the lack of prior communication. He has valid concerns about professionalism and personal preferences. Refusing the trip because she didn't ask first isn't entirely unreasonable. But by already booking everything, she might have overstepped, making it harder for him to back out without financial loss.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he had communicated his preference for not traveling earlier, maybe the situation could have been avoided. But since she didn't ask, and he has legitimate reasons for not wanting to go, his refusal isn't entirely his fault. However, his approach might come off as dismissive of her effort. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because his reasons are valid and he had the right to express his preference. The girlfriend's mistake was not discussing it first. So the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
