Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a surprise vacation paid for by the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland. She got the boss's approval months in advance, but she didn't check with the guy first. The guy is upset because he didn't get to decide if he wanted to go. He's in IT, she's in HR, different branches but same company. The main points: she didn't ask him, used company leave, and he would rather relax at home.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend did plan this without consulting him, which could be seen as not respecting his preferences. On the other hand, the author didn't express his preferences beforehand, so maybe he should have communicated his desire to not travel overseas. But the key here is that she made a big decision affecting him without his input. The author's friends say he's ungrateful, but is that fair? The surprise aspect might be nice, but the decision to use his leave without his consent is a big deal. He's worried about professional implications and personal preferences. \n\nThe girlfriend might have thought she was doing something thoughtful, but planning a major trip without discussing it with him first could be seen as overstepping. The author's refusal isn't about the money or the trip itself, but about not being asked. So, is he in the wrong? Well, maybe not. He had valid reasons about his leave and personal preferences. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him before making arrangements. So I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's justified in wanting to be consulted on a significant decision that affects him.\n"
