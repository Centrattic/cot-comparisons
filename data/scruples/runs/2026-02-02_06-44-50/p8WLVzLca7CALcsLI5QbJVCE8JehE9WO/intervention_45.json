Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend organized the trip without consulting him. She used their mutual boss to secure leave, which could be unprofessional, especially since they work in different departments under the same boss. The author is upset because he didn't agree to the trip, feels it's unprofessional to take couples' leave like that, and prefers to use his leave for relaxation. He's also concerned about the cancellation fees if he cancels.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend did plan the trip without his input, which is a big no-no. Even though she paid for everything, the fact that she didn't ask him first is problematic. The author's main issue is that his preferences weren't considered. He values his personal time and might prefer to spend it differently. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is being ungrateful since the trip was a surprise and a generous gesture. But the act of not getting his consent is a significant issue. The girlfriend's approach could have been better, as respecting the other person's wishes is crucial in a relationship. \n\nThe author's friends think he's being ungrateful, but the core issue is about mutual decision-making. The fact that he refused the trip because he wasn't asked first is valid. The girlfriend's actions, while well-intentioned, overstepped by making a major decision involving his work without his input. \n\nSo, in this case, the author is justified in his stance. The girlfriend's mistake was not involving him in the decision. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
