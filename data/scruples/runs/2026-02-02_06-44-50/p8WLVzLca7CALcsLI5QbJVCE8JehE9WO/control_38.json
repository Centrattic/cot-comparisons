Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author's girlfriend surprised him with a paid-for trip to Switzerland, but he refused to go because she didn't ask him first and he didn't want to use his leave for a vacation. The girlfriend had already arranged it with their boss, which the author found unprofessional.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend went to a lot of effort and expense to plan the trip, even coordinating with their boss in advance. She did this without consulting him, which is a big issue because taking leave for a trip is a personal decision. The author's concern is valid because using company leave for an overseas trip without prior approval could be problematic, especially if they work in different branches but report to the same boss. There's a risk of seeming unprofessional or getting into trouble if the boss approves such requests for personal reasons. Also, the author's preference to relax and sleep instead of traveling is his personal choice, which he didn't get a chance to express. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought she was doing something nice, surprising him, and covering all the arrangements to make it a special birthday gift. She might feel hurt or unappreciated when he refuses, especially since she's already incurred costs. Friends telling him he's ungrateful add pressure, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's wrong.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend made a significant decision without consulting him, which is a breach of trust or respect. The author has the right to decide how he uses his personal time and should be able to say no. The fact that she involved their boss without his knowledge adds another layer of concern about professional boundaries.\n\nHowever, the author's refusal might come off as dismissive of her effort. Maybe he should have expressed appreciation first before declining. But the core issue is whether he's wrong for refusing. Since the decision was made without his input, and he's within his rights to decline, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong). The girlfriend's actions were more problematic in not seeking his consent.\n"
