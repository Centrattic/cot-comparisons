Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend surprising her partner with a vacation to Switzerland, which she arranged without consulting him. The key points here are the author's refusal to go, the fact that the girlfriend used their mutual boss to secure leave without the author's input, and the author's discomfort with the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasoning. He's upset because the girlfriend didn't ask him about the trip and used their boss, which he considers unprofessional. He also prefers to use his leave for relaxation and sleep instead of traveling. His friends think he's ungrateful.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, the girlfriend did plan this without his input, which is a big deal. He has valid concerns about how she approached the leave request and the lack of communication. On the other hand, the surprise was a gift, and he's refusing to go which might hurt her feelings. But does refusing make him the wrong one here?\n\nI think the main issue is communication. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him before booking. The author is within his rights to express his discomfort and refuse to go. His friends saying he's ungrateful might not be considering his perspective. So, he's not in the wrong for refusing. The answer should be B.\n"
