Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the girlfriend surprised him with a two-week vacation to Switzerland, paid for by her. She had talked to their boss months in advance without telling him. He's upset because he didn't agree to it, feels it's unprofessional to have their boss involved in a couples' leave, and prefers to use his time off to relax and sleep. Friends say he's being ungrateful, but he thinks she should have asked him first.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend made a big decision without consulting him, which is a major issue in relationships. Planning a vacation, especially one that involves their mutual boss, is a significant action that affects both their work and personal lives. He's not against the trip itself but the fact that she didn't get his input. That's a valid concern because using vacation time is a personal choice, and having someone else decide that without discussion can feel disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was to plan a surprise, which is a common gesture to show love. However, her method involved making a decision that affects him without his consent. The fact that she had already arranged everything and paid for it complicates things, but that doesn't negate his right to be part of the decision-making process.\n\nThe author's friends think he's ungrateful, but gratitude doesn't mean you have to agree with or accept every action, especially if it's done without your consent. The main issue is the lack of communication. The girlfriend could have asked if he wanted a trip, how he wanted to spend his leave, or at least discussed the idea before finalizing everything. By not doing so, she overstepped, and his refusal isn't about the trip itself but the process leading up to it.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing because the girlfriend didn't seek his permission before making such a significant and personal decision. His right to control his own leave time and the method of planning without his input are key factors here. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
