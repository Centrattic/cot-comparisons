Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's go through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a surprise vacation for the birthday. She paid for everything, including flights to Switzerland and a ski resort. She talked to their mutual boss in advance without telling the author. The author is upset because he didn't know about it, didn't agree to it, and feels it's unprofessional to have the boss involved like that. He refused to go, and now the girlfriend is annoyed, and his friends say he's being ungrateful.\n\nSo, the main points of contention are: 1) The girlfriend didn't ask him if he wanted to go. 2) She involved their boss without consulting the author, which he thinks is unprofessional. 3) He prefers to use his leave time to relax and sleep instead of travel.\n\nThe author is saying that he would rather use his leave for something else, which is his right. The girlfriend did plan the trip without asking, which is where the issue starts. Even if she paid for it, the fact that she didn't get his consent is a problem. He has the right to decide how he wants to use his personal time. Also, involving a boss without discussing it with him first could be a breach of trust or unprofessional, depending on company policies.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend probably did this out of love and thoughtfulness. She might have assumed he would like it. But the key issue here is consent. Planning a trip without consulting the other person is a big deal, especially when it involves their work and time off. The author is within his rights to refuse because it's his personal leave. So, is he in the wrong for refusing? Or is the girlfriend in the wrong for not consulting him?\n\nThe friends say he's ungrateful, but if he didn't want to go, he's not being ungrateful for the gesture; he's respecting his own boundaries. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. The problem lies with the girlfriend not getting his permission. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
