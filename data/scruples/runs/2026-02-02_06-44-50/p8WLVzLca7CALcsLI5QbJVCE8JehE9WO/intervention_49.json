Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend surprising the author with a paid vacation in Switzerland, but he's upset because she didn't consult him and involved their shared boss.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend organized the trip by talking to their boss without the author's knowledge. He's annoyed because he didn't agree to this, and he's concerned about using his leave for overseas travel. The friends think he's being ungrateful, but he feels it's a big decision that she shouldn't have made without his input.\n\nSo, the main issue here is consent and communication. The girlfriend planned a surprise, which is a common gesture, but the problem is that she used company resources (talking to their boss) and made a decision about his leave time without discussing it. The author values his time and prefers to have control over how he uses his leave, which is a valid point. However, the girlfriend's intention might have been to make the birthday special, which could be seen as generous.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's job in IT might require different considerations compared to HR, and perhaps he has reasons to avoid overseas travel. The unprofessional aspect is the boss being involved without the author's consent. If the boss wasn't supposed to know, it could be a breach of trust or company policy. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, he didn't go along with the trip because he felt it was an important decision that required his input. He's not rejecting the gesture itself but the method. The girlfriend's actions, while thoughtful, might have overstepped by not consulting him, especially regarding leave. The author's right to control his own time and professional decisions could outweigh the surprise aspect. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend might have thought that since the boss approved, it would be okay. But the fact that she didn't ask the author first is a problem. The author's preference for relaxation and sleep instead of an overseas trip is a personal choice, and respecting that is part of a healthy relationship. \n\nSo, the author's refusal is based on valid reasons. The girlfriend's approach was perhaps too forceful, and by not discussing it, she didn't respect his autonomy. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. The answer could be B (No). But I should check if there's any nuance I missed. Like, maybe the girlfriend didn't mean to displease him, but she planned it with the boss. However, the author's job and personal preferences are crucial here. So, the answer is B.\n"
