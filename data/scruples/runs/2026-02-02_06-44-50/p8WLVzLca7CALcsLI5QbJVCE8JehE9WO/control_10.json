Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend surprising her partner with a paid vacation to Switzerland, but he's upset because she didn't ask him first and involved their boss.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend planned a surprise trip by coordinating with their mutual boss without the person's knowledge. The author is upset because he didn't agree to this and feels it's unprofessional, especially since they work in different departments but report to the same boss. He also mentions preferring to relax at home instead of traveling. The girlfriend already paid for everything, and he's refusing to go, leading to conflict.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLooking at the arguments: The author's main issues are that the plan was unilaterally decided, involved their boss without his consent, and he wasn't consulted. On the other hand, the girlfriend did this as a surprise, and friends think he's ungrateful. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, being inclusive in decisions that affect both partners is important. The girlfriend didn't ask his opinion, which he feels is a problem. Also, coordinating with a boss for personal leave, especially for a partner, could be seen as unprofessional, especially in corporate environments where HR and IT roles might have strict policies. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's intention was to do something nice, which she did, but the method might have been problematic. The author is justified in feeling that his preferences (relaxing at home) were ignored. The fact that she paid for everything and there are cancellation fees complicates things, but the main issue is about consent and communication.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's refusal isn't about the trip itself but the lack of consultation and the professional implications. He's not rejecting the gesture but the manner in which it was done. The girlfriend's approach might have been overstepping, especially involving their boss. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to refuse because he wasn't included in the decision-making, which is a valid concern in a relationship. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
