Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland. She talked to their mutual boss months in advance to secure leave without consulting the author. The author is upset because he didn't want to take couples' leave and prefers to use his time off to relax and sleep. He refused to go, leading to conflict. His friends say he's ungrateful, but he feels she should have asked first.\n\nI need to determine if the author is wrong. The key points here are consent and unprofessionalism. The girlfriend made a big decision without discussing it with him, which is a major issue. However, she did arrange the leave, which might have involved some unprofessional steps by discussing a personal matter with their boss behind his back. The author's main issue is that he wasn't asked, which is valid. People have different preferences for their time off; he wants solitude, she wants to travel together. \n\nBut was he wrong to refuse? Well, the girlfriend did spend money and effort, and he's aware that returning the tickets would cost her. However, the fact that she didn't consult him and that the leave arrangement could be seen as unprofessional complicates things. He's within his rights to decline if he's not comfortable with the terms. His friends' opinion that he's ungrateful might not consider the lack of consent aspect. \n\nThe author isn't being ungrateful for the gesture itself but for the method in which it was done. The girlfriend's approach was flawed. So, the answer would be that he's not in the wrong because she didn't ask, and he's justified in preferring his own plans. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
