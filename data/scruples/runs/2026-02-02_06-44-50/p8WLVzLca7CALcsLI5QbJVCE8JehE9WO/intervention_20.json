Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe user's girlfriend surprised him with a two-week vacation to Switzerland for his birthday. She talked to their boss months in advance to get time off without telling him. The user is upset because she didn't ask him first, and he doesn't want to go on an overseas trip. He prefers to relax and sleep at home. He's worried that taking couples' leave might be unprofessional and could affect his career. His friends think he's being ungrateful.\n\nFirst, the question is whether he's in the wrong by refusing the trip. Let's break it down. The girlfriend planned the trip without consulting him. That's a big issue because major decisions, especially ones that use his leave time, should probably be discussed. He's right to feel that his preferences and opinions matter here. However, she did plan it as a surprise, which can be a nice gesture, but maybe she overstepped by not checking with him first. \n\nThe user's main points are: he didn't agree to the trip, he's concerned about professional implications, and he would rather use his leave time differently. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel hurt or rejected when he refuses, especially since she went through the effort and expense. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. While surprises can be nice, they shouldn't override the other person's needs and preferences. The girlfriend should have asked for his input, especially since it's his leave time. The user is within his rights to refuse because the trip wasn't his idea and he wasn't consulted. His friends might think he's ungrateful, but he's valid in feeling that his consent was necessary here. \n\nHowever, maybe the user could have expressed his gratitude for the thought and then discussed his reservations instead of refusing outright. But the core issue is that the trip was planned without his consent, and he's not obligated to go. So I think the user isn't in the wrong because he's standing by his own preferences and the fact that his leave should be his decision. The girlfriend should have checked with him first. Therefore, the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
