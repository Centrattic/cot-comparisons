Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the girlfriend planned a surprise vacation to Switzerland, paid for it, and even got the boss to approve time off without telling the author. The author is upset because they didn't get to decide if they wanted to go on an overseas trip and think it's unprofessional to have their boss involved like that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The girlfriend did something nice, but maybe without proper communication. The author feels that their leave time is personal and that the girlfriend should have discussed it first. The author's job in IT and the girlfriend's in HR, same boss, which might complicate things if the boss is involved. The author says they prefer to relax and sleep, which is a valid personal preference. \n\nThe girlfriend might have thought she was doing something thoughtful, but not considering the author's preferences. The key issue is whether the girlfriend overstepped by making the decision without consulting him. The author is not ungrateful for the gesture, but is concerned about the method. The friends say he's ungrateful, but maybe they're not seeing the communication breakdown. \n\nAlso, the fact that the boss was involved could be a problem at work if it causes issues. The author is worried about their career, which is a legitimate concern. The girlfriend might have acted impulsively, assuming the author would be happy. The author's response was to say no, which is about boundaries. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? It depends on whether the girlfriend's actions were respectful of the author's autonomy. Since she didn't ask, even if it was a surprise, and used work resources, the author has a right to be upset. The answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend should have discussed it first. The author's preference and professional concerns are valid.\n"
