Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland, arranged with their mutual boss without the author's input. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, and he prefers to use his leave for relaxing at home. He's worried about the professionalism of their boss being involved and the unprofessionalism of taking time off for a trip he didn't plan. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend made a major decision without consulting him, which is a big deal when it involves his personal time and work. Even though she paid for it, the fact that she went behind his back and used their boss to get the time off seems like a breach of trust and respect. \n\nThe author's friends say he's ungrateful, but that might be missing the point. Gratitude is one thing, but autonomy over one's own schedule is another. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him first, considering his preferences. The author's refusal is about asserting his right to make his own decisions regarding his time off, which is valid.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the surprise being a birthday gift. People often appreciate surprises, so maybe the author's reaction is harsh. But the method she used\u2014using their boss without his knowledge\u2014might be the real issue here. It's not just about the trip itself, but the way it was arranged.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the main issue is not consulting him, then the girlfriend made a mistake. But the author's refusal could be seen as dismissing a thoughtful gesture, even if the execution was poor. It's a balance between respecting his autonomy and appreciating her effort. Depending on the perspective, the author might be in the right because he didn't want to go, and she should have asked. Alternatively, he might be in the wrong for not being more appreciative of the effort she put in, even if the approach was flawed.\n\nBut considering that the girlfriend used their boss without his knowledge, which could be unprofessional, the author's concern is justified. He's right to prioritize his own needs and the potential work implications. So, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because the girlfriend overstepped by not seeking his input, especially regarding his personal time and work.\n"
