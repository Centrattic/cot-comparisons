Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid by his girlfriend. The author's main points are that his girlfriend unilaterally arranged the trip without consulting him, used their shared boss to get leave, and he prefers relaxing instead of traveling. He's upset because it's unprofessional and he wasn't consulted.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend did plan the trip without his input. That's a big issue because it's about consent and mutual decision-making in a relationship. Even if the surprise was meant to be a nice gesture, it's important to consider the other person's preferences. The fact that she went to their mutual boss to arrange the leave without his knowledge adds another layer of unprofessionalism, which he's rightfully concerned about. \n\nBut then, the author didn't express his discomfort until after receiving the tickets. Maybe he could have communicated his feelings earlier, even in secret. However, the girlfriend already paid for everything, so returning the tickets might cause financial loss. The author's friends think he's ungrateful, but his reasons are valid\u2014unprofessionalism and lack of consultation.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was to do something nice, and the author rejecting it might hurt her feelings. But intentions don't always override the actual impact. The key here is whether the way the trip was arranged was respectful of his preferences. Since he clearly states he doesn't want to travel overseas, her action disregards his preference, which is a problem.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he's justified in his reasons for refusing, but maybe he could have handled it more empathetically. However, the main issue is the lack of communication from the girlfriend. His refusal is a reaction to her actions, which were not respectful of his autonomy. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because his refusal is based on valid concerns about professionalism and personal preference. The girlfriend's actions were the initial problem.\n"
