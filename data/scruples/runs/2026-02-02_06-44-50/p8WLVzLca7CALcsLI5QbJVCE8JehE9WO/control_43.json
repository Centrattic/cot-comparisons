Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the girlfriend planned a surprise vacation to Switzerland, paid for it, and told the author's boss in advance without his knowledge. The author is upset because he didn't agree to it, didn't apply for leave, and prefers to relax and sleep instead of traveling. The friends say he's being ungrateful, but he feels she should have asked first.\n\nFirst, the main points of contention: the girlfriend used company leave without the author's input, which he feels is unprofessional and could harm his career. Also, he wasn't consulted about using his leave for an overseas trip. The girlfriend spent money already, maybe with cancellation fees, but the author is still upset because he wasn't asked.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for refusing? Well, he has valid concerns about professional boundaries. His boss was contacted without his knowledge, which could be a problem if the company has policies against that. Also, using leave for a trip isn't something someone else should decide for him. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him first, even if she had the intention of surprising him. The fact that she didn't consider his preferences (he wants to relax, not travel) is another issue. \n\nOn the other hand, she did plan it as a surprise, which is a common romantic gesture. But the method\u2014without consulting him and involving his workplace\u2014might have crossed a line. The friends' reaction that he's ungrateful might be because they see the effort she put in, but that doesn't mean the approach was right. \n\nSo, the author's arguments are about autonomy and professional conduct. He's not wrong for wanting to control his own leave and being informed. The girlfriend made decisions that affect him without his consent. Therefore, the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
