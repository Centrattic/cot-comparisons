Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a surprise vacation paid for by the girlfriend. The author didn't ask for it and is now refusing to go.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned this surprise without consulting the author. She went ahead and booked all the flights and hotels, even talking to their boss in advance. The author feels that this is unprofessional because they hadn't applied for leave themselves. Also, he's not interested in an overseas trip and would rather use the time to relax at home. He didn't show enthusiasm, leading to conflict with his girlfriend and friends saying he's ungrateful.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girlfriend made decisions without the author's input, possibly overstepping by involving their boss, and the author is now rejecting the trip. The question is whether he's in the wrong for refusing.\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend did something thoughtful and generous, expecting a positive reaction. She might have done it with good intentions, thinking the author would enjoy the trip. Her friends argue that he's being ungrateful. But on the other hand, the author has valid concerns. He didn't agree to the trip, and his job could be affected if the leave was arranged without his approval. Also, personal preferences matter\u2014he might not want to travel, even if it's a nice gesture.\n\nThe girlfriend's approach might have been too presumptuous. Even if she wanted a romantic gesture, she should have discussed it with him first. The author's right to decide how he uses his leave is important. Refusing the trip isn't just about being ungrateful; it's about respecting his boundaries and job considerations.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He had the right to express his preferences and concerns. The girlfriend's mistake was not consulting him before making plans. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
