Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. The situation involves some workplace considerations and personal preferences.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend organized a two-week trip to Switzerland, using their company's leave. The key points are that she spoke to their boss without consulting him, which he found unprofessional. He doesn't want to take leave for an overseas trip and prefers to relax at home. He's upset because she didn't ask first, and now she's annoyed, while his friends say he's ungrateful.\n\nSo, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. To decide, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's intention was a surprise gift, which is a nice gesture. She did go through the trouble of booking everything and talking to their boss. On the other hand, the author's main issue is that she didn't consult him. He values his autonomy in deciding how to use his leave and feels that her action was overstepping, especially since using company leave for personal travel might be seen as unprofessional. Also, he's concerned about the potential career impact of her talking to their boss.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, surprising someone with a gift isn't inherently wrong, but it's important to respect the other person's preferences and boundaries. If he's clear about not wanting to travel, she should have considered that. However, the surprise might have been meant to show her appreciation, and he's rejecting it because of the method rather than the gesture itself. But since she didn't check with him, maybe he's right to feel it's a breach of his autonomy. His friends calling him ungrateful might be missing the point; his issue isn't about gratitude but about the lack of consultation.\n\nWorkplace unprofessionalism is a valid concern. If their boss is aware, and if that could affect his career, that's a legitimate reason to be upset. The girlfriend might not have realized the implications of her actions regarding workplace policies. So, the author's refusal is based on valid reasons related to his career and personal preferences.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the girlfriend could have at least asked if he wanted to go, even if she had already planned it. The author isn't wrong to express his discomfort with the surprise, especially given the potential professional risks. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; the issue is more about the girlfriend not respecting his input and the workplace boundaries.\n"
