Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a girlfriend who planned a surprise vacation, paid for it, and coordinated with their mutual boss without the author's consent.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend did plan this without consulting him. She used company resources (talking to their boss) which could be seen as unprofessional, especially since they work in the same company. The author is in IT and she's in HR, different branches but same boss. Her actions might have crossed a line by not asking him first, which is a key point. The user's close friends think he's ungrateful, but the girlfriend didn't check his preferences. \n\nThe author's main issue is that he doesn't want to use his leave for an overseas trip and prefers to relax. He didn't like that she made the decision without him. The girlfriend might have overstepped by involving their boss without his knowledge, which could indeed affect his career. The fact that the tickets are already bought and non-refundable complicates things, but the core issue is about consent and communication.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong for refusing? Well, he did express his discomfort and decided not to go. Since he had valid reasons and the girlfriend didn't ask first, it's more about her actions rather than his refusal. The friends saying he's ungrateful might not consider that he's not against the trip itself but the lack of consultation. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for declining, especially since the planning was done without his input. So the answer is B.\n"
