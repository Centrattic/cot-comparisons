Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The main issue is that the girlfriend arranged a surprise vacation without consulting the author, using their leave time and involving their boss.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland. She talked to their boss months in advance to arrange the leave, which the author thinks is unprofessional. The author is upset because they prefer to relax at home and feel that their leave should be their choice. The girlfriend paid for everything, and the author is considering refusing to go, leading to some conflict.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. Let me break down the key points.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions: She used company resources (talking to their mutual boss) without the author's consent. Arranging leave like that could indeed be seen as unprofessional, especially since they work in different departments. The author's concern about jeopardizing their career is valid. Also, the girlfriend didn't ask if he wanted to take the trip, which is a major issue. Deciding on someone's vacation plans without their input is a big deal.\n\nThe author's response: He refused to go because he wasn't consulted. His friends say he's being ungrateful. But is he wrong? Well, the trip was a surprise, but the method of arranging leave might be problematic. The author has the right to choose how he uses his leave. The girlfriend overstepped by not discussing it with him and involving their boss without his knowledge.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's intention might have been to do something nice. But the way she did it was without his consent, which is a key issue. The author has the right to his own preferences. So while the trip itself is generous, the lack of consultation and potential professional risks are valid concerns.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for refusing. He has valid reasons related to his own preferences and professional boundaries. The girlfriend's actions were problematic, which is why the author is justified in his response. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
