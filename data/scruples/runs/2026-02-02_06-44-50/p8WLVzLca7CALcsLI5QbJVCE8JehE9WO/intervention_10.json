Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland. She got the flights and even coordinated with their mutual boss to get time off. The key points here are that she went behind the author's back to arrange leave, which he finds unprofessional because they work in different departments but report to the same boss. Also, he wasn't asked if he wanted to go on this trip; she just assumed he would like it. He's more interested in relaxing and sleeping, so the trip isn't his ideal vacation.\n\nNow, the girlfriend already paid for everything, including ski resorts, so there might be financial stakes involved. The author is upset because he believes she should have discussed it with him first. The friends think he's ungrateful. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the girlfriend did something thoughtful, probably intending to show love. She made significant arrangements, which took effort and money. She might have thought the surprise would be a nice gesture. On the other hand, the author has valid concerns. Using company leave for a trip without his consent could be seen as unprofessional, especially in their workplace context. Also, he didn't have a say in how he wanted to spend his vacation time, which is a personal choice.\n\nThe author's main issue is that he wasn't asked. Even though the trip is a surprise, the fact that she didn't consult him about using his leave or the destination is a problem. He's right to feel that his preferences were overlooked. However, his response of completely refusing might come across as dismissive of her effort. Maybe a middle ground would have been better, like discussing the trip after the surprise but before finalizing plans if he didn't want to go.\n\nBut then again, she already paid for it. If he refuses, there are cancellation fees, which could be seen as making her lose money. But that's her responsibility for not checking with him first. The author's stance is about autonomy over his own time and professional boundaries. The girlfriend's action, while well-intentioned, overstepped by not seeking his input on a major decision affecting him.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think he's not entirely wrong because he has a right to make decisions about his own time and how he uses his leave. However, his refusal might come off as unappreciative. The balance here is tricky. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him, and he's justified in feeling that way. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
