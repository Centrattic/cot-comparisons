Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend planned a surprise vacation to Switzerland, paid for it, and told their boss in advance without asking the author. The author is upset because they didn't get to agree to using their leave for a trip, and they prefer to use the time to relax and sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend made a significant decision without consulting her partner. Using vacation days is a personal choice, and even though the boss was involved, the author's consent wasn't sought. That's a big deal because vacation time is something an employee has the right to manage as they see fit. Also, the girlfriend coordinated this with their boss, which might be unprofessional, given that they work in the same company, even different departments. \n\nThe author's reasons for refusing seem valid. They don't want to travel overseas and prefer to relax. The girlfriend's action of pre-approving leave with the boss without the author's input could indeed create issues in the workplace, especially if it's seen as favoritism or if the author isn't comfortable with the boss knowing their personal plans. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was to surprise the author with a nice gift. But the problem is the lack of communication. The author's right to control their own vacation time is important. Even if the trip was a gift, the method of arranging it without consent might have overstepped. \n\nThe friends say the author is ungrateful, but gratitude doesn't override personal boundaries. The author has the right to say no, especially when the planning involved third parties unilaterally. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions were presumptuous, and the author is justified in refusing. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
