Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA) for refusing a surprise vacation paid by his girlfriend. The girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland, arranged with their mutual boss without consulting the author. He's upset because she didn't ask for his input, the use of company leave for personal travel is unprofessional, and he prefers to relax at home.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's actions: she made a big decision involving his personal time and work without discussing it. That's a red flag. Even though it's a nice gesture, she overstepped by not respecting his autonomy. Using company resources for personal leave without his consent could be problematic, especially since they report to the same boss. That could lead to workplace issues, which he's validly concerned about.\n\nThe author's response: he felt annoyed and decided not to go, explaining he didn't want to travel. He was honest but maybe could have handled it more gracefully. However, his main point is about the lack of communication and the potential professional risks. His friends call him ungrateful, but he's not wrong to prioritize his preferences and professional boundaries.\n\nThe girlfriend's annoyance is understandable, but her approach was flawed. She should have discussed the trip first. The author isn't in the wrong for standing his ground. He has valid reasons related to both personal preference and professional integrity. So, the answer should be B (No), he isn't in the wrong.\n"
