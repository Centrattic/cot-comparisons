Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a surprise vacation paid for by the girlfriend, which the author is refusing to go on.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland. She approached their mutual boss months in advance to arrange leave without consulting the author. The author is upset because he didn't know about it beforehand and didn't agree to the trip. He values his personal time to relax and sleep, not travel. He's worried about the professionalism of their boss being approached for couples' leave without his consent.\n\nThe girlfriend has already paid for everything, including flights and ski resorts, so canceling would incur fees. The author didn't express enthusiasm, which led to conflict. His friends say he's ungrateful, but he believes she should have asked first.\n\nNow, considering the key points: the girlfriend made a big decision without consulting him, which is a significant issue in a relationship. The author's preference for using his leave time differently is valid. The surprise was meant to be a gift, but the method of planning\u2014without his input\u2014could be seen as overstepping. The author's refusal isn't about the trip itself but the lack of communication. \n\nIs it wrong to refuse a gift that was planned without your consent? The girlfriend intended to surprise him, but the author's feelings about how it was arranged are important. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him first, even if it was a surprise. The author's stance on using leave as he sees fit is reasonable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; the girlfriend's approach was the issue. So the answer is B.\n"
