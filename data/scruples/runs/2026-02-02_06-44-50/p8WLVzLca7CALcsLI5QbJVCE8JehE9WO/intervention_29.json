Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend arranged a two-week trip to Switzerland without consulting him, even talking to their boss in advance. The author is upset because he didn't ask for leave, and he prefers to relax and sleep instead of travel. His friends say he's ungrateful, but he thinks she should have asked first.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to assess both sides. The girlfriend did plan something nice without discussing it. She might have thought it's a romantic surprise. But the author feels it's unprofessional to involve their boss and that he wasn't consulted. He's worried about career implications and his personal preference. \n\nIs it wrong to not be excited about a surprise trip? Maybe not. People have different preferences. The fact that she used her own money and made arrangements without his input is key here. The author's main issue is that he wasn't asked, which is valid. Respecting each other's boundaries is important in a relationship. However, the girlfriend might have intended it as a kind gesture, assuming he'd like it. \n\nThe author's friends think he's being ungrateful for not accepting the gesture. But gratitude is about acknowledging the effort, even if the action isn't desired. However, the author's refusal isn't about not appreciating the gesture but about the decision-making process. \n\nProfessionally, using their boss for couples' leave might be a problem, as the author points out. That's a legitimate concern. So the issue is both about personal preferences and professional repercussions. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he did refuse the trip, but his reasoning is based on valid points: lack of consultation, professional risks, and personal preference. On the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was to do something nice without discussing it. \n\nIn relationships, mutual communication is crucial. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him before making decisions, especially involving work. So the author's stance isn't without merit. But he could have expressed appreciation for the effort while explaining his reasons. \n\nHowever, the core issue is whether he's wrong for refusing. Since he was not consulted and the trip involves professional risks, his refusal is justified. Therefore, he's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
