Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend organized a two-week trip to Switzerland without consulting him. She even went ahead and told their boss to keep it a secret, which the author finds unprofessional.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend probably did this out of love and excitement for the author's birthday. She might have thought it would be a great surprise, showing her dedication and wanting to create a special experience. She went to the effort of coordinating with their boss and paying for everything, which shows she put a lot of work into this.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels that she didn't consult him, which is a big deal. He's concerned about the professional implications of using leave for an overseas trip and prefers to use his time off to relax at home. He also mentions that he wasn't asked if he wanted to go, which is a valid point. Personal preferences matter in relationships, and not being included in such a major decision could lead to feelings of being disregarded.\n\nThe key points to consider: Did the girlfriend overstep by making a significant decision without consulting her partner? The author's main arguments are about unprofessionalism and lack of communication. The girlfriend's actions could be seen as thoughtful but perhaps not considering his boundaries and professional concerns.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and communication are crucial. The fact that she went ahead without discussing it with him first is a problem. Even if her intentions were good, not considering his perspective and preferences is a misstep. The author has valid concerns about his career and personal preferences. However, his reaction of refusing might come off as dismissive of her efforts. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he didn't express his concerns to her and just refused, maybe he could have handled it more sensitively. But the core issue is that the girlfriend didn't seek his input. The author's right to have his preferences respected is important here. Therefore, the girlfriend might be more at fault, but the author's refusal without some form of dialogue could be seen as harsh. However, since the question is about the author, the answer would depend on whether his refusal is justified given the lack of prior consent.\n\nConsidering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend didn't consult him first. His decision to refuse is a boundary he's setting, which is understandable given the circumstances. So the answer is B.\n"
