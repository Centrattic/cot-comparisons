Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend surprising her boyfriend with a paid-for vacation to Switzerland, which she arranged without consulting him, even getting their boss's approval in advance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend planned a surprise trip, used their mutual boss to secure leave, and didn't ask the boyfriend if he wanted to go. The boyfriend is upset because he didn't have a say in using his vacation time for an overseas trip, which he prefers not to do. He's also concerned about professional implications of using leave for a couples' trip. His friends say he's being ungrateful, but he's standing his ground.\n\nNow, evaluating both sides. The girlfriend's intention was to make his birthday special, which is thoughtful. However, she didn't consult him, which is a major oversight. Using company leave for a personal trip, especially without the employee's consent, could be unprofessional, especially since they report to the same boss. The boyfriend's concern about jeopardizing his career is valid. Additionally, he didn't want to go overseas, so his refusal is about personal preference and professional boundaries.\n\nIs the boyfriend in the wrong? Well, he did refuse a gift that was already paid for, but his reasons are based on valid concerns about his job and personal preferences. He didn't accept it without question, which his friends criticize, but he's standing up for his own boundaries. On the other hand, the girlfriend overstepped by making a decision that affects him without his input. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the girlfriend's actions were the root of the issue. She should have discussed the trip with him first, especially since it involved his personal time and company policies. The boyfriend's refusal isn't ungratefulness but a matter of respecting his own wishes and professional considerations. Therefore, the main fault lies with the girlfriend for not communicating. Hence, the author (boyfriend) isn't in the wrong.\n"
