Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend who planned a surprise vacation to Switzerland, paid for it, and told the author's boss in advance without consulting the author. The author is upset because he didn't want an overseas trip and felt she should have asked first. His friends say he's being ungrateful.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend used her position in HR to coordinate with their boss, and she did it without the author's consent. The author feels that using company leave for an overseas trip is unprofessional and that she should have asked him first. He also mentions that he would rather relax and sleep during his leave. The girlfriend is upset because he didn't seem enthusiastic and he refused to go. The friends think he's in the wrong for not being grateful.\n\nNow, considering the perspectives. The author's main issue is about the lack of consultation. He believes his personal preference for relaxation over travel is valid. The girlfriend's action of arranging this without asking could be seen as overstepping, especially since she used company resources (talking to their boss) which might be unprofessional. However, she might have intended it as a kind surprise, thinking he would appreciate it. The fact that she already paid for everything and there would be cancellation fees complicates the situation, but he's standing by his decision not to go.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. From a communication standpoint, she should have discussed the trip with him before making plans. Planning a surprise like this without considering his preferences could be seen as dismissive of his wishes. Also, using their boss's approval without the author's input might be a breach of professional boundaries. On the other hand, he could have been more appreciative of her effort and found a compromise, maybe using the trip but with some changes.\n\nBut the core issue is whether he's wrong for refusing. He's not obligated to accept a gift he doesn't want. The problem is more about the lack of communication from her side. He's justified in wanting to use his leave as he prefers. So, the answer would depend on whether the lack of communication is the girlfriend's fault, making the author not at fault. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because she didn't consult him, and he's within his rights to refuse based on his own preferences.\n"
