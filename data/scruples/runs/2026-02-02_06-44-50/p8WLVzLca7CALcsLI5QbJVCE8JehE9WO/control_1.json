Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a trip to Switzerland, using company leave that she discussed with their boss. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first and used their mutual boss, which he thinks is unprofessional. He prefers to use his leave time to relax and sleep. The girlfriend is annoyed because he's not enthusiastic, and friends say he's ungrateful.\n\nSo, the main points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend made a big decision without consulting him. Even though she meant well, surprising someone with such a significant commitment, especially involving work, can be a problem. The author has valid concerns about professionalism and personal preference. He's right to feel that using company leave should be his decision. Also, returning the tickets isn't feasible due to cancellation fees, so he's stuck with it. But he's not obligated to go on a trip he didn't agree to. The girlfriend should have discussed it first. The friends saying he's ungrateful might not see the lack of communication. The key issue is that she didn't ask, which is a big oversight. So the author isn't wrong for refusing. Answer B.\n"
