Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who planned a surprise vacation, paid for it, and coordinated with their mutual boss to get time off. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first and he doesn't want to travel. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The girlfriend did coordinate with their boss for leave, which is a significant step. The author is in IT, and she in HR, both under the same boss. She paid for everything, including flights and resorts, so there's financial commitment here. The author is annoyed because he wasn't consulted, and he prefers to relax at home instead of traveling. His friends say he's ungrateful.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key factors are: Did she have the right to book the trip without his input? Was her approach to their boss appropriate? Is it reasonable for him to refuse the trip now?\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's intentions might have been good\u2014planning a special surprise for his birthday. She took initiative by talking to their boss, which could be seen as proactive. However, the author's main issue is that he wasn't asked. In relationships, major decisions involving both partners' time and finances usually require mutual agreement. Even if she intended to make it a surprise, the fact that he didn't want to go and that she used their shared boss to get leave might have overstepped without his consent.\n\nThe author's argument is about autonomy and prior communication. He values his personal time and prefers relaxing at home, which is a valid perspective. By not discussing it with him, she made a decision that affects him. The financial aspect complicates things because returning the tickets would cost her money, but he's not in the wrong for not wanting to go against his preferences. \n\nThe girlfriend's approach to their boss could be unprofessional, especially if using company resources or time off for personal reasons without his knowledge. Even if she did it discreetly, it's a risk that could backfire. The author is right to be concerned about potential career impacts from such an action.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's intentions were to create a memorable experience. The surprise aspect might have been well-meaning, but it's essential to communicate in a relationship. The author's friends saying he's ungrateful might be missing the point; being ungrateful is different from having valid concerns about the method and lack of consultation.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't wrong for setting boundaries. He has the right to decide how he uses his leave time. The girlfriend's mistake was not discussing it with him first. The author is justified in refusing to go, even though it might hurt her feelings. The key is mutual respect and communication, which were lacking here.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him before making plans, especially involving their boss and significant financial commitments.\n"
