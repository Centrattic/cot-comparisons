Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend planned a surprise trip to Switzerland for his birthday, using vacation time. She talked to their boss without his knowledge, and he's upset because she didn't ask him first. He didn't go, and now she's annoyed. The friends say he's ungrateful, but he thinks she should have asked.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend went to a lot of effort and expense, maybe thinking it was a nice surprise. She might have thought it was a good idea because their boss approved, so she felt confident. But the author is upset because he didn't want to use his vacation for an overseas trip and prefers to relax and sleep. Also, using company leave for a trip without his consent could be a problem, especially since they work in the same company. \n\nCommunication is key here. The girlfriend didn't check with him before making the plans. Even if she thought it was a good idea, he has the right to decide how to use his vacation time. By not consulting him, she made a big decision that affects him. On the other hand, the author didn't express his preferences beforehand. If he had mentioned he didn't want to travel, maybe she wouldn't have done it. But she did this as a surprise, so maybe she didn't consider his wishes. \n\nThe author's main point is about autonomy over his vacation time and being involved in the decision. The girlfriend's actions were well-intentioned but perhaps overstepped. The friends say he's ungrateful, but gratitude doesn't mean you have to agree to something you're uncomfortable with. The author is standing his ground on a personal boundary. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's preferences is important. While the trip was a nice gesture, the method of planning it without discussion is problematic. The author is in the right for not going because it was a joint decision that should have been mutual. So the answer is B (No).\n"
