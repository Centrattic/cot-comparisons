Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a surprise vacation paid for by the girlfriend. The main issue is that the girlfriend arranged the trip without consulting the author, using their leave time, and the author is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She planned a surprise for his birthday, which shows she wanted to do something special. Since they work in different departments but under the same boss, she approached the boss in advance to secure leave, which she kept a secret. She paid for everything, so there's a financial investment involved. She didn't ask because she wanted it to be a surprise, which is common in relationships.\n\nNow, the author's perspective. He didn't like the idea of using leave for an overseas trip and preferred to relax at home. He feels it's unprofessional for their boss to know about their personal plans. Also, he's upset that she made the decision without consulting him. He's concerned about potential career risks. His friends say he's ungrateful, but he feels his preferences weren't respected.\n\nKey points to consider: Did the girlfriend overstep by arranging leave without his input? Is it reasonable for him to have preferred not to use his leave this way? The girlfriend's intention was good, but the method might have been flawed. The author has the right to decide how he uses his leave. Even though it's a surprise, making such a significant decision without involving the other person can lead to conflict. The fact that he's in a different department but under the same boss might complicate things if their boss is involved. \n\nThe author's refusal isn't about not appreciating the gesture but about the lack of consultation. So, is he in the wrong? If the girlfriend should have asked, then he's not wrong. But if the surprise is acceptable and he's being ungrateful, then he is. However, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial in a relationship. She arranged something that affects his leave time, which is his personal choice. So, maybe he's not in the wrong. The answer might be B.\n"
