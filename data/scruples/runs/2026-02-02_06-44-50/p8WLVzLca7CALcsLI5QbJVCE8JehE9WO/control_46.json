Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend organized a two-week trip to Switzerland, pre-arranged with their mutual boss, and didn't ask the author first. The author is upset because she went behind his back to get the time off from work, which he considers unprofessional and a risk to his career. Also, he mentions he would prefer to relax and sleep instead of travel. He's refusing the trip, and now his girlfriend is annoyed, while his friends say he's ungrateful.\n\nSo, the key points are: the girlfriend planned the trip without consulting him, involved their boss without his input, and the author is refusing it. The question is whether he's wrong for doing so.\n\nI should consider the dynamics here. Did the girlfriend overstep by making plans without his consent? Yes, because even though it's a surprise, she should have discussed it with him first. Using their boss's influence for personal leave without the employee's approval is problematic. The author has a valid concern about professionalism and his own preferences.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intent was to give a surprise gift, which is a kind gesture. But the method was flawed. The author has the right to set boundaries about his time and career decisions. Refusing the trip because of the way it was arranged isn't about the trip itself but about respect and communication. His friends' comments that he's ungrateful might not consider his valid reasons.\n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for refusing because the trip was planned without his input and could have professional repercussions. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him first. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
