Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about the author refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. The girlfriend arranged two weeks in Switzerland without consulting him, even securing time off from their mutual boss. The author is upset because he didn't know about the plans, didn't apply for leave himself, and would prefer to relax at home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend took the initiative to book the trip, which is a generous gesture. However, the author feels she overstepped by not asking him first. The main issue is about consent and communication. The girlfriend wanted to surprise him, but he feels it's unprofessional to coordinate leave through their boss without his input. Also, he didn't want to use his vacation time for an overseas trip when he'd rather relax locally.\n\nNow, thinking about the dynamics. The girlfriend probably intended the trip as a kind gesture for his birthday. Surprises can be great, but they require considering the other person's preferences. The author's concern is valid because using vacation time for a trip isn't something to be decided unilaterally, especially when it involves company leave and potential work repercussions. He has the right to decide how to use his own vacation days. The girlfriend might have assumed he'd be excited, but not checking in with him first shows a lack of communication.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend did plan ahead and may have wanted to make his birthday special. However, the key point is that she made a significant decision without his input, which affected his work and personal preferences. The author's refusal isn't about the trip itself but about the lack of consultation. His friends say he's ungrateful, but the issue is more about autonomy over his time rather than the gift itself.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for objecting. The girlfriend should have discussed the plans with him before booking. The author's choice to decline is about respecting his own preferences and professional boundaries. So the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), because the girlfriend didn't consult him regarding his personal time and work.\n"
