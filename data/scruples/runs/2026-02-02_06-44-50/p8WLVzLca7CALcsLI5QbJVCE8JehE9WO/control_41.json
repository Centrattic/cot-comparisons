Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend planned a surprise vacation to Switzerland for the author's birthday. She went ahead and booked everything, even talking to their mutual boss about it without the author's knowledge. The author is upset because he didn't want to take such an expensive trip and felt she should have asked him first. The friends are saying he's ungrateful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend made the arrangements without consulting the author. She used their boss, which could be a professional risk. The author is in IT, she's in HR, and they report to the same boss. The author didn't know about the leave, so he might feel it's unprofessional. Also, he would prefer to use his time off for relaxation and sleep rather than travel. The girlfriend already paid for everything, so returning the tickets isn't easy.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's not happy with the surprise and refuses to go. But the girlfriend did it as a surprise, thinking it was a good idea. However, she didn't ask him, which is a problem. The author has a right to his own preferences about how he uses his leave. The fact that she went to their boss without his input might be a bigger issue. The author's stance is that he should have been consulted first. The friends say he's ungrateful, but maybe they don't see the lack of communication. The girlfriend's actions might have overstepped by not involving him in the decision. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because his main issue is being involved in decisions that affect him. The girlfriend's approach was presumptuous. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
