Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. The situation involves a surprise trip to Switzerland with flights and a resort, all arranged without the author's prior knowledge or consent.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend organized the trip without consulting him, even though she spoke to their mutual boss. The author is upset because he didn't want to use his leave for an overseas trip and prefers relaxing at home. He didn't want to go, so he refused, leading to a conflict. His friends say he's ungrateful, but he feels she should have asked first.\n\nSo, the main question is about consent and communication. The girlfriend made a big decision that affects him, which is using his vacation time. Vacation time is a personal resource, and even though she paid for it, the decision to use his leave should involve his input. The author's refusal is based on his personal preference, which is valid. On the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was to do something nice, but she didn't consider his preferences.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he didn't say no immediately. He was annoyed but then decided to refuse after considering cancellation fees. He communicated his feelings to her when she asked why he was unhappy. His stance is about the lack of prior discussion, which is a legitimate point. The girlfriend's mistake was not checking with him first. The author's refusal isn't about being ungrateful but about the decision-making process. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. His friends' take is that he should just go, but that doesn't account for his personal preferences. So, the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
