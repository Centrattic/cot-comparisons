Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author refusing a surprise vacation to Switzerland that his girlfriend paid for, which she had arranged by talking to their mutual boss ahead of time.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend planned the trip without consulting him, even though it requires using his leave time, which he wasn't okay with. The author is upset because she didn't ask first, and he feels it's unprofessional to have their boss involved in personal leave for a vacation. The friends think he's being ungrateful.\n\nSo, the main conflict here is about consent and communication. The girlfriend did something nice but without considering his preferences. The author's concern is about the unprofessional aspect of involving their boss in arranging leave for a personal trip. Also, he doesn't want to travel overseas and would prefer to rest at home. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, the girlfriend's gesture was generous and a surprise, which is meant to show she cares. But she didn't communicate with him about it, which is a big oversight, especially since it affects his work and personal preferences. The author's refusal is based on valid concerns about professionalism and personal preference. \n\nThe friends say he's ungrateful, but gratitude doesn't override the need for mutual consent in such a significant decision. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him before booking everything. The fact that she already paid and there are cancellation fees doesn't negate the importance of his consent. \n\nHowever, the author could have handled the situation better. Maybe he could have appreciated the gesture while explaining his reasons. But the core issue is that the girlfriend didn't ask, and he's justified in wanting to opt out. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for refusing. He's standing up for his preferences and work ethics. The girlfriend is at fault for not communicating. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
