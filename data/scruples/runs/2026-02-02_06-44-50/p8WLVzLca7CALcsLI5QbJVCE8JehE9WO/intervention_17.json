Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. The situation involves several key points.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland without consulting him. She arranged it by talking to their mutual boss, which the author feels is unprofessional. He didn't like the idea of using his leave for an overseas trip and would prefer to relax at home. He refused to go because she didn't ask first, leading to her being upset. Friends think he's ungrateful.\n\nI need to evaluate if he's in the wrong. The main issue is about consent and communication. The girlfriend made a significant decision without discussing it with him, which is a problem. She used company resources (talking to their boss) without his input, which could indeed be unprofessional and risky for his career. The author's concern about using leave for something he didn't agree to is valid. However, he did receive a nice gift, and his reaction might come off as dismissive. But the core issue is that she didn't check with him first, which is a major oversight in a relationship. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially regarding his personal time and career. So, while he could have expressed his feelings more kindly, the main fault lies with the girlfriend for not consulting him. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
