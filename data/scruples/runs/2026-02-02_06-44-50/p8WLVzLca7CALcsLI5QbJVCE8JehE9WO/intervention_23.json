Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that his girlfriend surprised him with a paid vacation to Switzerland, but he refused to go because he didn't like that she used company leave without asking him and he prefers to stay home. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend probably wanted to do something nice for his birthday and went to the trouble of arranging everything, even talking to their boss in advance. She might have thought it was a great surprise and a way to spend time together. She paid for everything, so she might feel hurt that he's not excited and is turning it down.\n\nOn the author's side, he's in IT, she's in HR, and they work under the same boss. He's concerned that taking couples' leave is unprofessional and could affect his career. Also, he wasn't consulted about using his leave for an overseas trip. He prefers to relax and sleep, which is a valid personal preference. He didn't act enthusiastic, which upset her, and friends are saying he's ungrateful.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key points here are communication and consent. The girlfriend made a big decision without consulting him, which is a major issue. Using company leave for personal travel without his input might be a breach of trust. However, the surprise element might be a factor. He was annoyed because she didn't ask, but he didn't voice his concerns until she noticed. \n\nIs it wrong for him to refuse? Well, he's within his rights to not want to go on a trip he didn't agree to. However, the way he reacted\u2014suddenly refusing after being given the gift\u2014could be seen as dismissive of her effort. Maybe he should have communicated his preferences earlier instead of waiting until after the surprise. \n\nAlso, the fact that she paid for everything and there are cancellation fees adds another layer. He didn't want to make her lose money, but he still chose to refuse. That could be seen as not considering her feelings or the effort she put in. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him first. Taking leave without his input is a big deal, especially in their work environment. He has valid concerns about professionalism. So maybe the main fault lies with her for not checking with him, but the author's reaction might still be seen as ungrateful because he didn't express his feelings until after the fact.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks at whether the person acted unreasonably. Here, the author's reasons are valid, but the way he handled it might come off as abrupt. The girlfriend's actions were overzealous, but the author's refusal without prior discussion could be seen as the issue. \n\nI think the author is partially in the wrong because he didn't voice his concerns when she first mentioned the trip. However, his main issue is about the lack of consultation, which is a valid point. The answer might be a mix, but since the options are A or B, and the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer likely leans towards A (he is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate his preferences earlier and his refusal might have been abrupt. But some might argue B because she didn't ask. Hmm, it's a bit tricky. I think the community might side with A because the surprise was a nice gesture, and he didn't express his feelings until after the fact, making him seem ungrateful.\n"
