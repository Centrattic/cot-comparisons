Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. The situation involves a planned trip to Switzerland for two weeks, flights and everything, arranged by his girlfriend without his prior knowledge.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend organized this without consulting him. The author is in IT, she's in HR, and both work under the same boss. She went ahead and told their boss to keep it a secret, which the author found unprofessional. He's concerned about using company leave for an overseas trip, which could affect his career. Also, he prefers to use his leave time to relax and sleep, not travel. He didn't express his refusal immediately and only told her after she noticed his unhappiness. His friends think he's being ungrateful.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. The girlfriend's intention was to do something nice, which she did, but she didn't seek his input. The author feels that using company leave for a trip without his consent is unprofessional and against his personal preferences. However, he didn't voice his concerns until after the fact. He could have discussed it with her before making a decision. But she had already paid for everything, so returning the tickets would be difficult.\n\nThe key points are: she didn't consult him, which is a major issue because it's about his time and professional life. He has valid concerns about his career and personal preferences. However, not showing initial enthusiasm might have been perceived as ungrateful. But the main issue is her planning without his input. So, the author's stance is understandable, but maybe he could have communicated better. However, the main fault lies with her for not getting his approval first. Therefore, the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
