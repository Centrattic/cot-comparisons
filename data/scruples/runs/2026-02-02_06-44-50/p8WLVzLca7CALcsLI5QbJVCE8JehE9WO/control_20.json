Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend surprising her partner with a paid vacation to Switzerland, but he's upset because she didn't ask him first and involved their boss.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend organized the trip without consulting him, even though it requires using his leave time. The author feels that asking their boss for couples' leave is unprofessional and could affect his career. He also mentions he would prefer to relax and sleep instead of traveling. He was going to return the tickets but didn't because of cancellation fees. Friends say he's ungrateful, but he's standing by his decision.\n\nThe main issues here are consent and communication. The girlfriend made a significant decision that affects both their schedules and professional lives without discussing it with him. While her intention was to surprise him, not consulting him might have disregarded his preferences. The author's concern about professional consequences is valid, especially since they work under the same boss. The surprise might have been well-meaning, but without his input, it could lead to issues at work. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend did plan the trip and already spent money, which complicates things. The author's refusal might seem ungrateful, but the right to use his leave as he sees fit is important. The fact that he told her he didn't want to go because she didn't ask first shows he valued his autonomy. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The girlfriend should have discussed the idea with him before securing the trip. The author isn't entirely wrong to be upset about the lack of communication and the potential professional risks. On the other hand, the girlfriend's effort to plan a surprise might be seen as thoughtful, but it backfired because she didn't consider his perspective.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't in the wrong. The main issue was the lack of communication from the girlfriend. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
