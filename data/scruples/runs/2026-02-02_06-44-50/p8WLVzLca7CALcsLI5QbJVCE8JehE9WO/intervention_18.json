Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend got flights to Switzerland for a two-week holiday. She talked to their mutual boss in advance without asking the author. The author is upset because he didn't ask for leave, it's unprofessional, and she didn't consult him. He wants to use his time to relax and sleep instead. He refuses to go, leading to conflict. Friends say he's ungrateful.\n\nSo, the key points here. The girlfriend did plan the trip without consulting him, which is a big deal. She used company resources (talking to their boss) to arrange leave, which the author rightly points out is unprofessional. The author's main issues are that he wasn't asked, and the method of getting leave could jeopardize his career. Also, he doesn't want to go on an overseas trip and prefers relaxation. The girlfriend paid for everything, but he can't just cancel because of fees.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to decide. \n\nFrom the author's perspective: He has valid concerns about professional boundaries and autonomy. His girlfriend made a major decision without his input, involving their boss. He has the right to decide how he uses his leave time. The surprise might have been well-intentioned, but the execution was problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was to do something nice. She might have thought it was a great surprise. But she didn't consider his preferences or how it might affect their work. \n\nThe main issue is whether the author is being ungrateful or standing up for his boundaries. The trip was a surprise, but he didn't like the way it was handled. The fact that she didn't ask him first is a red flag. He has the right to refuse because it's his time and his job. The friends' advice that he's ungrateful might not take into account the professional risks and lack of consent. \n\nSo, I think the author is not in the wrong. He has valid reasons to refuse. The girlfriend should have discussed plans with him first. Therefore, answer B.\n"
