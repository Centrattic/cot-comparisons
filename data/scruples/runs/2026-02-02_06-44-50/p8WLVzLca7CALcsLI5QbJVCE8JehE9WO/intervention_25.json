Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend planned a surprise vacation, got flights, and told their mutual boss in advance without the author's consent. The author is upset because he didn't agree to the trip, prefers relaxing at home, and is worried about the professional implications of the leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend put in effort to plan a surprise, and she did check with their boss, which she thought was necessary. She might have thought it would be a nice gesture, especially for his birthday. On the other hand, the author feels his preferences weren't considered. He didn't have a say in using his leave, which he values more for rest. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend didn't ask him before making the arrangements, even though she had to get the leave approved. The author's main issue is that his personal choice wasn't respected. While the girlfriend's intention was good, the method might have been flawed. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate and respect each other's wishes. Even if the surprise was meant to be a gift, the author's feelings about how his leave time is used are valid. He has the right to decide how he wants to spend his time off. The girlfriend planning without discussing it first might have overstepped, even if she had good intentions. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend did put in a lot of effort and money, which adds another layer. But the author's discomfort with the professional aspect (using leave for travel without his input) and his personal preference to relax are significant. So while the girlfriend's actions weren't malicious, the author's right to autonomy in his time off is important. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's standing up for his own boundaries, which is reasonable. The girlfriend didn't ask, but the author also didn't express his preferences beforehand. Maybe there's a middle ground, but he's not entirely wrong in refusing. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
