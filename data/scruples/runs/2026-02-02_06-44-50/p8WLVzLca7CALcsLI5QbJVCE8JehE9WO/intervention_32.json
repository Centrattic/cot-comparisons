Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a surprise vacation paid for by the girlfriend. The author refused to go because he felt it was unprofessional for his girlfriend to talk to their boss about taking leave without consulting him first. He also didn't like that she decided to use his leave for an overseas trip without asking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend planned the surprise, which she might have done thinking it would be a nice gesture. She did talk to their boss in advance, which the author is upset about. He feels that using company leave for a vacation, especially without his input, is unprofessional and could affect his career. Also, he prefers to use his leave for relaxation and sleeping at home rather than traveling.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought this surprise was a great way to celebrate his birthday and wanted to make it special. She might have assumed he would be happy and didn't consider his preferences. The friends think the author is being ungrateful, which adds another layer. \n\nBut the key point here is consent. Did the author have any say in the matter? The girlfriend made the decision without consulting him, which is a big issue. Even if the intention was good, not asking about his preferences and making a significant decision about his leave time is a problem. The author has a right to his time and how he uses his leave. The girlfriend's action could be seen as overstepping by involving their boss without his knowledge. \n\nThe author's refusal is based on valid concerns about professionalism and personal preference. The girlfriend's surprise, while well-meaning, disregarded his autonomy. So, in this case, the author's decision to refuse might be justified because he didn't want to compromise his job and had different plans. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him first. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong here. \n\nBut wait, maybe the surprise was a gift, so the author shouldn't have to go against his will. However, the fact that she involved their boss without his knowledge complicates things. If she had just given him the tickets without involving the company, maybe it's a different scenario. But since it's tied to his leave and her talking to their boss, it's a professional matter he's concerned about. \n\nSo considering all that, maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. He has a right to be upset about his leave being managed without his input, especially when it's a professional matter. The girlfriend should have asked him first.\n"
