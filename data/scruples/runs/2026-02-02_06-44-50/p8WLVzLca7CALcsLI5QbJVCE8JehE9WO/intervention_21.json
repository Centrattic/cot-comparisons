Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend surprising her boyfriend with a paid vacation to Switzerland, but the man refused to go because she didn't ask him first.\n\nFirst, consider the girlfriend's intentions. She planned a surprise, which she thought would be a nice gesture. She even coordinated with their boss in advance, which shows effort. She didn't consult him because it was a surprise, but maybe she should have considered his preferences. However, the main point is that she organized it without his input.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is upset because he didn't want to take a vacation for travel, preferring to relax and sleep. He might feel that his autonomy was ignored. The girlfriend's actions could be seen as overstepping by making a big decision for him. But she did spend her money and arranged everything, leading to potential fees if he backs out. His friends say he's ungrateful for not going.\n\nThe key here is communication. While the girlfriend intended a surprise, she didn't check if he wanted that. The author has valid reasons for not wanting to go, and his right to make such a decision is important. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him first. However, the author didn't express his discomfort until she noticed, which might have made her feel hurt. \n\nWhether he's in the wrong depends on whether respecting his wishes outweighs the girlfriend's effort. Since she should have asked, the author isn't in the wrong for rejecting the trip. He has every right to prioritize his preferences. The answer is B.\n"
