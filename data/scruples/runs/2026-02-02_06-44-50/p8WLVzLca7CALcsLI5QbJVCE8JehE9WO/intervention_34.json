Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by their girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a trip without consulting him. She told their boss in advance, which the author sees as unprofessional. He's upset because he didn't agree to the trip and would prefer to relax at home. The girlfriend paid for everything, so he's worried about cancellation fees. His friends say he's being ungrateful.\n\nI need to evaluate both sides. The girlfriend intended a surprise, which might come from a place of wanting to do something nice. But she didn't ask him first. The author is within his rights to not want to go on an overseas trip, especially if it conflicts with his preferences. However, the surprise element might be seen as thoughtful, even if done without his input.\n\nThe key points: Did she respect his autonomy? By not asking him, she assumed he'd be okay with it. He's right to feel that she should have discussed it with him. On the other hand, she made the effort and used company resources, which could be a valid concern. But the main issue is that he didn't agree to the trip. His right to control his own vacation time is important. \n\nSo, while the girlfriend overstepped by making the decision without him, the author is justified in refusing. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
