Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about refusing a surprise vacation paid for by their girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland. She talked to their boss in advance without the author's knowledge. The author is upset because she didn't consult him about using his leave and felt it's unprofessional. He prefers to relax at home instead of traveling. Friends say he's being ungrateful, but he thinks she should have asked first.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend made a big decision without discussing it with him. Planning a vacation, especially one involving time off work, is a significant commitment. Even if it's a surprise, she didn't consider his preferences. The author's main issue is that his input wasn't sought, which is valid. He's not rejecting the gesture because he's ungrateful, but because it affects his personal and professional life without his say in the matter.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's intention was to make his birthday special. She went to the effort and expense, which she might see as a romantic gesture. But the problem is that she didn't check with him first. The fact that she used their boss without his knowledge adds another layer of unprofessional risk, which he rightly points out could affect his career.\n\nThe friends say he's ungrateful, but gratitude doesn't mean he has to accept something that makes him uncomfortable. The author has the right to set boundaries. He's not in the wrong for wanting to communicate his preferences. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him before making arrangements. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
