Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation that his girlfriend paid for, especially since she arranged it with their mutual boss. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The girlfriend planned a surprise trip, which she did by talking to their boss in advance. She paid for everything, including flights and a ski resort. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first and he doesn't want to go overseas on leave. He thinks using leave for a vacation is unprofessional and might affect his career. Also, he prefers to relax at home. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend likely wanted to do something special for his birthday. She made the arrangements without consulting him, which is a big decision. The fact that she went to their boss might be a point of contention because it's their mutual boss, and asking for couples' leave could be seen as crossing a professional boundary. \n\nThe author's friends say he's ungrateful, which is a common argument here. But gratitude aside, the main issue is communication. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him before booking, as it's a significant use of his leave. The author has a valid point about not being asked and the potential professional implications. However, the fact that she already paid and the author is now refusing might make it seem like he's not appreciative of her efforts.\n\nBut then, the author's reasoning is about professional boundaries and personal preference. If the girlfriend didn't overstep by talking to their boss, maybe the author is within his rights to refuse. However, the surprise aspect and not consulting him first is a problem. The key here is whether the girlfriend's actions were appropriate. If she used her position in HR to influence the boss, that could be unprofessional. The author is right to be concerned about that. \n\nSo, the author's refusal is based on valid concerns about overstepping at work and lack of consent. But is he in the wrong for not accepting the surprise? It depends on the relationship dynamics. If the girlfriend's actions were well-intentioned but poorly executed, the author is justified in his refusal. However, if the girlfriend's approach was unprofessional and the author's refusal is a reasonable response, then he's not in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks at intent and boundaries. The girlfriend intended a nice surprise but may have overstepped by approaching the boss without the author's input. The author's refusal is based on valid reasons, so perhaps he's not in the wrong. But if the girlfriend's actions were within professional bounds and the author is just being ungrateful, then he might be. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (author not in the wrong) because he's standing up for his boundaries and the girlfriend's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially with the boss. However, there's a counterargument that the author is ungrateful. But given the professional concerns, the author has a point. So, B.\n"
