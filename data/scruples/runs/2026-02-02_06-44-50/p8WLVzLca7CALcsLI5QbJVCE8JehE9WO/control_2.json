Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend planned a surprise vacation for his birthday, paid for everything, and even talked to their boss in advance. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first and he doesn't want to go on an overseas trip. His reasons are that it's unprofessional to involve their boss for personal leave like couples' trips, and he prefers to relax and sleep instead of traveling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend put effort into organizing this surprise, which shows her thoughtfulness and commitment to making his birthday special. She might have done it without consulting him because she wanted it to be a surprise, but that doesn't mean she had to bypass his input. However, the author is concerned about professionalism. Since they work in different departments but report to the same boss, asking for leave through their boss could indeed be unprofessional if it's for a personal trip. The author's main issue is that he wasn't consulted, which is valid because major life decisions, like a two-week vacation, should involve both partners. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have assumed he would be excited and that the surprise was a good idea. The author's friends say he's ungrateful, but if the trip doesn't align with his preferences, then he's justified in not wanting to go. The key point here is consent and communication. Even though a surprise can be nice, it's important that both parties agree on such a significant plan. The author's refusal isn't just about being ungrateful but about respecting his personal preferences and professional boundaries.\n\nSo, considering that the girlfriend didn't ask him first and the author is justified in feeling that his input was necessary, the author isn't in the wrong. His reasons are valid because he's standing up for his own needs and professional standards. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
