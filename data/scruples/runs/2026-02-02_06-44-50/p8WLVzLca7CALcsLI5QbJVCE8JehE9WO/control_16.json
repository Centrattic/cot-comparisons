Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a girlfriend surprising her partner with a paid vacation to Switzerland without consulting him first. The key points here are the surprise nature of the trip, the use of their mutual boss to secure leave, and the girlfriend's decision to book the trip without the partner's input.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a surprise. While surprises can be nice, the issue here is the lack of communication. The author mentions that he would prefer to relax and sleep, which suggests he has different vacation preferences. The girlfriend didn't check with him about his travel plans, which is a significant oversight. The fact that she used their boss to get the time off without his knowledge adds a layer of unprofessionalism, as the author points out. This could have implications for their careers, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions might come from a place of wanting to do something special, but she didn't consider his feelings or preferences. The author's main issue is that she didn't ask for his input, which is a reasonable expectation. The friends' reaction that he's ungrateful might stem from a misunderstanding of the situation, as being grateful for the gesture doesn't mean he has to go if it's against his wishes.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend did plan something nice, and the author might be seen as rejecting a kind gesture. However, the core of the issue is mutual respect and communication. The author has a right to his own preferences and concerns about the trip. The fact that the trip was booked without his knowledge and involves professional risks makes it a more complex situation than just a simple refusal of a gift.\n\nSo, balancing both sides, the author's main point is about respecting his autonomy and the professional implications. The girlfriend's actions, while well-intentioned, crossed a line by not seeking his input. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for standing by his decision to refuse the trip.\n"
