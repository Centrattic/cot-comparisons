Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after refusing a surprise vacation arranged by his girlfriend. The main points to consider are the girlfriend's actions and the author's response.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland, paid for everything, and got the author's boss's approval without consulting him. She did this months in advance. The author's main objections are that using leave for an overseas trip is unprofessional and that she didn't ask him first. He also prefers to relax and sleep instead of traveling.\n\nNow, thinking about the girlfriend's perspective. She wanted to do something nice for his birthday, which is a kind gesture. She took the initiative to handle the logistics, which she thought would be a surprise. However, she didn't consider his preferences, which could be a big issue. The fact that she went to the boss without discussing it with him might have crossed a line, especially if the author feels that using leave for a trip is unprofessional. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's refusal might be seen as ungrateful. The girlfriend put in a lot of effort and money, and the surprise was intended to be a positive experience. But the author's right to have a say in how he uses his vacation time is valid. People have different preferences about how to spend their leave; some might love travel, others might prefer rest. The girlfriend should have asked, as it's his time. \n\nThe author's friends say he's being ungrateful, but maybe they're not considering that the girlfriend overstepped by not getting his input. The key issue is consent. The girlfriend made a significant decision that affects the author's professional and personal life without consulting him. That's a problem. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's not wrong for not wanting to go, but he might be at fault for not being more appreciative of her effort. However, the main fault lies with the girlfriend for not asking. The author's refusal is a valid response to her overstepping. Therefore, the answer would be B (he's not in the wrong).\n"
