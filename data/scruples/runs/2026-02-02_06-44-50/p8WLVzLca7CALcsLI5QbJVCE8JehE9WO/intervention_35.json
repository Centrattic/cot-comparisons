Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong for refusing the surprise vacation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland. She coordinated with their boss in advance to get the leave approved. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first and that she used company leave without his input. He prefers to use his leave time to relax and sleep. He felt it was unprofessional to have the boss involved without his knowledge.\n\nSo, the main points here are: 1) Did she overstep by arranging the leave without consulting him? 2) Is the author justified in refusing the trip? 3) How does the company policy play into this?\n\nThe girlfriend did plan the trip and took the initiative to talk to their boss. She might have thought it was a nice surprise, but the author feels it's a big decision that requires mutual agreement. The author's issue is that she didn't get his input and that he's not interested in an overseas trip. He also mentions it could jeopardize his career, which might be a real concern if taking leave in a certain way isn't advisable professionally.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have felt she was doing something thoughtful, and the author's refusal could come off as ungrateful. His friends say he's being ungrateful, which adds to the social pressure.\n\nBut the key here is whether the author was wrong to refuse. The girlfriend did plan everything, but she didn't check with him. The author feels that using company leave for something he didn't agree to is unprofessional. He also has a valid preference for how he wants to use his time off. So, is he in the wrong for prioritizing his own wishes over her surprise?\n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's expressing his own preferences and concerns. However, the way he handled the rejection might have been abrupt, especially if he didn't consider the effort she put into planning. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for refusing. Since he's not happy with the method she used to plan it, and he has legitimate reasons (professional concerns and personal preferences), he might not be in the wrong. The girlfriend should have discussed the plans with him first, so the author's refusal is understandable. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
