Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this question. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland. She got the flights, talked to their boss months in advance to arrange the leave, and didn't check with the author. He's upset because she didn't ask him and using leave for an overseas trip might be unprofessional, especially since they work in different departments but report to the same boss. He also prefers to use his leave to relax and sleep at home. The girlfriend is annoyed, and his friends say he's ungrateful.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: 1) Did she overstep by arranging leave without his consent? 2) Is the author justified in refusing the trip? 3) Was it unprofessional for her to coordinate with their boss without discussing it with him?\n\nStarting with the first point. The girlfriend did plan something without consulting him. Even if it's a surprise, using his leave time is a significant decision. Work leave is personal time, and she didn't check if he wanted to use it for travel. That's a big oversight. People have different preferences for how they want to spend their time off, so not asking him about the trip is a problem.\n\nSecond, the author's reasons for refusing. He's concerned about professionalism. If she approached their boss, that could create issues if other employees saw it as favoritism, or if it's against company policy. Also, the company might have specific leave procedures that weren't followed. Plus, he doesn't want to travel overseas, which is a personal preference. So, he's not wrong to prioritize his own needs here.\n\nThird, the girlfriend's actions. She made a decision that affects him without his input. Even though it's a gesture of love, it's important to respect each other's preferences and boundaries. The fact that she didn't consider his feelings or his professional concerns shows a lack of communication. He's within his rights to feel that she should have discussed it with him first.\n\nLooking at the friends' take: they say he's ungrateful. But gratitude doesn't override personal preferences and professional boundaries. Just because someone gives you something nice doesn't mean you have to accept it if it makes you uncomfortable or if it's unwise.\n\nAnother angle: the financial aspect. She paid for everything, including ski resorts, and there might be cancellation fees. However, that doesn't negate his right to refuse. He's not obligated to go just because she spent money. She could've asked him first, which would have avoided this situation.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If he had agreed to go without any issues, maybe he'd be wrong for not appreciating the surprise. But since he had valid reasons\u2014professional and personal\u2014it's more about mutual respect. The girlfriend should have communicated better. The author isn't wrong for standing by his decision, especially if he explained his reasons clearly.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's justified in his refusal because she didn't consult him, the use of leave could be problematic professionally, and personal preferences matter in how one uses their time off.\n"
