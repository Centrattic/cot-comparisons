Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation that his girlfriend paid for and arranged with their boss. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland. She paid for everything, including flights and resorts. She told the author's boss months in advance to keep it a secret. The key points here are: she didn't ask the author if he wanted to go, she involved their boss without the author's input, and he prefers to use his leave to relax and sleep instead of traveling.\n\nThe author is upset because he feels this is unprofessional. Asking their boss for couples' leave could be seen as mixing personal and professional, which might affect their careers. Also, he didn't have a say in how he uses his leave time. He's not against the trip itself but the fact that she made the decision without consulting him.\n\nThe girlfriend is annoyed because he wasn't enthusiastic, and the user's friends think he's ungrateful. But the user is standing by his decision because he believes she should have asked him first. \n\nNow, considering the situation: While the trip is a generous gesture, the main issue is the lack of communication. She assumed his preferences without checking, which is a problem. The author's right to use his leave as he wishes is important. Even if she had good intentions, not discussing it with him first is a misstep. His refusal is about asserting his autonomy, not being ungrateful. So, he's not in the wrong because he's validly expressing his boundaries.\n"
