Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the girlfriend surprising the author with a paid trip to Switzerland for their birthday. The key points here are about consent and communication.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend paid for the trip and arranged it without the author's input. She went to their mutual boss to secure the leave months in advance without consulting him. The author is upset because he didn't want to use his vacation time for an overseas trip and feels that his input should have been considered. He also mentions that asking their boss for couples' leave might be unprofessional and could affect his career. \n\nThe author's main issue is that his girlfriend didn't ask him before making the plans. While the trip is a surprise and a generous gesture, the lack of communication is a problem. The author has valid concerns about professional boundaries and personal preference. The girlfriend's actions, while well-intentioned, overstepped by making decisions that involve his work and personal time without his consent. \n\nThe friends think he's being ungrateful, but the author isn't rejecting the gesture because he's unappreciative; he's rejecting it because of the lack of communication and the potential professional repercussions. So, the author's stance is about respect for his autonomy and professional integrity. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because he's asserting his right to be consulted on matters that affect him directly, especially in a professional context. The girlfriend's actions, while thoughtful, disregarded his boundaries.\n"
