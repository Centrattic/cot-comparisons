Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the girlfriend planned a surprise vacation to Switzerland, paid for it with flights, and told the author's boss to keep it a secret. The author is upset because they didn't get to choose and the request to their boss might be unprofessional.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend used her position in HR to coordinate with their mutual boss without the author's consent. The author feels that using company leave for a vacation without his input is a problem. Also, he's not interested in an overseas trip and would prefer to relax at home. The girlfriend didn't ask him, which is a big issue for him. He was supposed to go on an unplanned trip, but he refused because he felt it was done without his approval.\n\nNow, thinking about the ethics here. Did the girlfriend overstep by making a major decision that affects the author's work and personal time? She did it as a surprise, which is a gesture of love, but it's a significant decision that impacts his schedule. The author has the right to control his own leave time. The fact that she didn't consult him first is a problem. Also, using their boss without the employee's knowledge could be seen as unprofessional and potentially risky for their careers. The author's refusal seems justified because he's standing up for his own preferences and the professional boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intentions were good\u2014planning a surprise birthday trip. But the method was flawed. She didn't consider his feelings or preferences, which is a big oversight in a relationship. The author's friends say he's ungrateful, but maybe they don't see the lack of communication here. The author isn't rejecting the gesture, but the way it was executed without his input. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't wrong for being upset. The girlfriend made a big decision without consulting him, which is a breach of mutual respect. The author's career and personal preferences matter, so he's not in the wrong for declining the trip. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
