Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the girlfriend planned a surprise vacation for the author's birthday, paid for everything, and even talked to their boss without his knowledge. The author is upset because he didn't agree to it, didn't apply for leave, and he prefers to use his time off for relaxing at home instead of traveling. His friends are saying he's ungrateful, but he feels like she should have asked him first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend clearly put a lot of effort and money into this trip, and the surprise was meant to be a nice gesture. She did coordinate with their boss, which might have been a way to make it happen without the author knowing. But the key point here is that the author didn't have a say in the matter. The girlfriend made a decision that affects his leave time without consulting him. That seems like a problem because using paid leave for a trip is a personal choice, and he might have different priorities. \n\nThe author's job is in IT, and their boss is the same. If the boss approved the leave without the author's knowledge, that could lead to issues, especially if the author feels it's unprofessional. Also, the author mentions that he would prefer to use his leave to relax and sleep, which is a valid preference. The girlfriend's action, while well-intentioned, might have disregarded his wishes and could have potential negative consequences for their work relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was to create a special experience for the author. She might have thought that a surprise would make his birthday extra special. However, the key issue here is consent and communication. Even if the trip is a surprise, it's important to consider whether the other person is comfortable with the plans, especially when it involves their personal time and career. \n\nThe author's friends are telling him he's ungrateful, but that might be because they don't see the underlying issue of his personal boundaries being crossed. The author isn't refusing the trip out of spite but because he has a legitimate reason to be concerned about how it was arranged without his input. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He has the right to his own preferences about how he uses his leave time. The girlfriend should have discussed the plan with him before making such a significant decision. It's a matter of respecting each other's boundaries and communication. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
