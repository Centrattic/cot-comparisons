Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The author's girlfriend planned a surprise vacation without consulting him, using company leave that they had to coordinate with their boss. The author is upset because he didn't want to take a vacation and felt it was unprofessional. His friends think he's being ungrateful, but he feels she should have asked first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend's intention was to do something nice for her partner, which is a kind gesture. She went through the trouble of organizing it, talking to their boss, and even paid for everything. She might have assumed the author would be happy and that he didn't want to take a vacation. However, the author clearly states that he prefers relaxing and sleeping over traveling overseas. He also feels that coordinating leave with their boss without his input was unprofessional and could risk their jobs.\n\nThe key points here are communication and consent. The girlfriend didn't ask him before making these plans, which is a big deal because using company leave for a vacation isn't something that should be done without the employee's consent. Especially since they work in the same company, the author might be concerned about how this affects their professional reputation. If the boss knew they were coordinating leave for a trip, it might look unprofessional if the employee wasn't on board with it. \n\nThe author's decision to refuse the trip is about personal preference and professional boundaries. He has the right to decide how he uses his vacation time. The girlfriend's actions, while well-meaning, overstepped by making a significant decision without his input. Even though she had good intentions, the lack of communication is a problem here.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend didn't explicitly ask because she wanted it to be a surprise. But in doing so, she didn't consider the author's preferences or the potential professional implications. The author isn't being ungrateful; he's standing up for his own needs and boundaries. His friends' opinion that he's being ungrateful is a bit one-sided. Gratitude is important, but respecting someone's wishes about their own time and work-related decisions is also crucial.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He's justified in refusing because the decision to take a specific type of vacation should be mutual, especially when it involves professional aspects. The girlfriend should have discussed the plan with him first to ensure it aligns with his preferences and work considerations.\n"
