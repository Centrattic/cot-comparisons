Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned an overseas trip without consulting him. She coordinated with their mutual boss, which is a big deal because they work in different departments but report to the same person. The author is concerned that taking leave without his consent might be unprofessional and could affect his career. Also, he prefers to use his time off to relax at home rather than travel.\n\nHe didn't like that she made the decision without asking him, which is a valid point. People have different preferences for how they want to spend their time off. The girlfriend might have thought it was a romantic gesture, but the author feels it was done without his input. The friends say he's ungrateful, but gratitude doesn't mean you have to go against your own preferences. \n\nThe key issues here are consent and communication. The girlfriend didn't ask if he wanted to go, and the author is within his rights to decline. However, he might need to consider the effort she put into planning and the financial aspect. But since she already booked everything, he can't get a refund, but he still has the choice to go or not. \n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, it's about respecting each other's boundaries. The author isn't wrong for not wanting to go, especially if he didn't agree. The girlfriend shouldn't have made the decision without discussing it with him first. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
