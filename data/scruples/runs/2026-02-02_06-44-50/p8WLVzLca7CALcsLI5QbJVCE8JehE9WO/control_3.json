Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. So, the girlfriend got flights to Switzerland without asking him and told their boss months ago. The author is upset because he didn't agree to it, didn't want to use his leave for a trip, and prefers relaxing instead.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girlfriend's intention was a surprise gift, which is a nice gesture. She went to the effort of planning it and even talking to their boss. She might feel hurt that he refused, especially if she put in a lot of work. On the other hand, the author didn't like the idea of using his vacation time for a trip without his consent. He values his time and wants to use it for rest. Also, using leave for a trip could be unprofessional if not handled properly, and he might have valid concerns about work protocols.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend didn't ask if he wanted to go, which is a big part of the issue. Even if she planned everything, not consulting him first could be a mistake. The author's main problem is that his preferences were overlooked. While the surprise was intended to be kind, respecting his autonomy is important. Also, the fact that their boss was involved without his knowledge adds another layer, as it could affect their professional standing.\n\nFriends say he's ungrateful, but maybe they're not considering his valid reasons. The author isn't rejecting the gesture entirely, just the method. He's more interested in using his time to relax, which is a personal choice. So, is he in the wrong? Well, he's justified in feeling that his girlfriend should have asked him first. She had the right to plan a trip, but without his input, it's a problem. Therefore, the girlfriend might be at fault for not consulting him, but the author isn't wrong in refusing because he wasn't consulted.\n"
