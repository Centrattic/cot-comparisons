Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by their girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland, got the author's boss's approval without consulting him, and paid for everything. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first and he prefers to use his leave time to relax at home. He refuses to go, and now she's annoyed. Friends say he's ungrateful, but he thinks she should have asked.\n\nSo, the main points here are about consent and communication. The girlfriend made a big decision without discussing it with the partner, especially something that involves work leave and significant financial commitment. Even though she got the boss's approval, the author's personal preference was overlooked. \n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend might have thought she was making a thoughtful surprise, showing she cares. But on the other hand, major life decisions, especially those involving time off work and personal preferences, should ideally be mutual. The author has valid concerns about professionalism and personal space. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not going. The girlfriend did a lot, maybe overstepped by involving their boss and spending money without consultation. The author's refusal is based on his own needs and the fact that he wasn't consulted. While it's understandable that the girlfriend wanted to do something nice, the key issue is lack of communication. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries and preferences is important. The author isn't in the wrong for standing by his preferences, even if it means disappointing the girlfriend. However, some might argue he's being ungrateful because the gesture was generous. But the lack of communication from the girlfriend's side also plays a role. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong. He has a right to his own preferences and should have been consulted. The girlfriend's approach was flawed because she didn't check with him. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily at fault for declining the surprise trip without prior discussion.\n"
