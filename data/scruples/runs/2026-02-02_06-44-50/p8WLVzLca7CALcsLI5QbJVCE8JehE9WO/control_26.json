Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend surprising him with a paid vacation to Switzerland. The key points here are consent and communication.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend arranged the trip without consulting the author. She talked to their boss in advance, which the author finds unprofessional. The author feels that using company leave for a couples' trip could affect his career, and he prefers to use his leave time to relax and sleep. He refused to go because he wasn't asked first, and now friends think he's being ungrateful.\n\nThe author's main argument is that he wasn't consulted, and the arrangement could be risky. The girlfriend, on the other hand, wanted to do a surprise and had already paid for everything. The question is about whether the author is wrong for refusing.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, consent is important. Even if the girlfriend meant well, making a significant decision without the other person's input can be problematic. The author has valid concerns about professional boundaries and personal preferences. The surprise might have been nice, but the lack of communication is a key issue here. The fact that the author's refusal is based on both professional and personal reasons strengthens his position. Friends saying he's ungrateful might be missing the point about the lack of consultation. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's standing up for his boundaries and preferences.\n"
