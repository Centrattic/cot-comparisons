Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by their girlfriend. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland. She got the author's boss to approve the leave in advance, which the author didn't know about. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, and he would prefer to use his leave time to relax at home. The friends think he's being ungrateful, but the author feels she overstepped by arranging the trip without his consent.\n\nNow, considering the main points. The girlfriend did make a significant decision involving the author's time off without consulting him. Even though she had good intentions, using his leave time without his input is a big deal. The author's concern about professional boundaries is valid because coordinating leave with a mutual boss, especially in different departments, could indeed be seen as unprofessional. He also mentions that he doesn't want to travel, so his preferences were ignored.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions were meant to be a surprise and a gift. She invested money and effort into planning it, and she might feel hurt by the refusal. The friends' advice about being ungrateful points to the idea that the author isn't appreciative of her thoughtfulness.\n\nBut the key issue here is consent. The author's time off is his to manage unless he agrees to use it for something else. The girlfriend's decision to book it without his input, despite the financial aspect, was a breach of his autonomy. Even though she tried to make it a surprise, the method of securing his leave without his knowledge is problematic.\n\nThe author's reasons for refusing are about personal preference and professional concerns. He's not wrong to prioritize his own needs here. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him before making any arrangements. So, while the author might have caused her feelings to be hurt, the fault isn't entirely his. However, the main question is whether he's in the wrong for refusing. Since he had valid reasons and the trip was arranged without his consent, he's not in the wrong.\n"
