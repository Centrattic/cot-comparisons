Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. The situation involves a couple working in different departments but with the same boss. The girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland, got leave approved without the author's consent, and now he's upset because he didn't want to go overseas and prefers to relax at home.\n\nFirst, the author's main points are about unprofessionalism and lack of consultation. He's annoyed that his girlfriend approached their boss without asking him first. He thinks it's unprofessional, especially since they work in different branches and maybe it's not appropriate for her to handle his leave. Also, he didn't want to take time off for an overseas trip and would rather use the leave to rest. The girlfriend might face cancellation fees, so returning the tickets isn't ideal. He told her he's unhappy and refused to go, leading to her being annoyed and his friends saying he's ungrateful.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The girlfriend did make a surprise, which can be a nice gesture. However, planning a vacation that uses his leave without his input is a problem. The author's right to make his own decisions about his time off is important. Even though she did it with good intentions, she didn't consider his preferences. Using the boss to get leave without his knowledge could be seen as overstepping, especially if it's not a common practice. The author is within his rights to refuse if he's not comfortable with the arrangement. His friends' advice might be from a place of wanting him to be grateful, but it's not about gratitude\u2014it's about respecting his autonomy and work-life decisions. The girlfriend should have asked first. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
