Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation arranged by his girlfriend, who paid for it and already got approval from their boss.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend organized the trip without consulting him. That's a big point. She used their mutual boss, which could be unprofessional since they're in different departments. The author is concerned about professional implications and his own preferences. He prefers to relax and sleep during his time off, which is valid. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions might come off as overstepping. She made a significant decision without his input, even though he didn't have a say. The fact that she paid for everything adds pressure, but he's not obligated to go just because she spent money. \n\nFriends say he's being ungrateful, but gratitude doesn't mean he has to comply with something he's uncomfortable with. His main issue is that she didn't ask first. The key is whether the author is in the wrong for asserting his own wishes. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. The girlfriend's surprise might have been well-intentioned, but she should have discussed it first. The author standing his ground isn't necessarily wrong. He's prioritizing his own needs and values. So, the answer is B; he's not in the wrong.\n"
