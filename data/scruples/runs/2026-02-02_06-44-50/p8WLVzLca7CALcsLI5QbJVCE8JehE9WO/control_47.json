Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation their girlfriend planned without consulting them. The girlfriend used their leave time and told their boss without permission.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend acted without the author's input. She made a significant decision that affects the author's personal time. Using company leave without discussing it could be a problem, especially since they work under the same boss. The author felt it was unprofessional and against their preferences. They wanted to use their leave to relax and sleep, not travel.\n\nThe author's main issue is that the girlfriend didn't ask first. The girlfriend paid for everything, but the author's right to make their own decisions about their leave time is important. Even if the girlfriend had good intentions, not seeking consent is a key point here. The friends saying the author is ungrateful might be missing the fact that consent is necessary. The author isn't rejecting the gesture, but the lack of communication and potential professional risks.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought she was being thoughtful. But the method was flawed. The author's job could be at risk if the boss found out about unauthorized leave discussions. Also, the author's desire to use their time differently is valid. The surprise was a nice idea, but executed without considering the author's preferences and professional boundaries.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend didn't respect their autonomy. The author has every right to decline something that wasn't discussed properly. The key points are lack of communication and respecting the author's personal choices. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
