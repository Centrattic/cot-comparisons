Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the girlfriend planned a surprise vacation for the author's birthday, paid for it, and arranged time off with their mutual boss without consulting the author. The author is upset because they think it's unprofessional to approach their boss about a vacation, especially for a couples' trip, and they don't want to use their leave for an overseas trip. They prefer to relax and sleep instead. The girlfriend is annoyed, and the author's friends say he's being ungrateful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend did a big, expensive surprise without asking. The author is concerned about professional conduct and says they would have preferred not to take the leave. The girlfriend already paid, so returning the tickets would be costly. \n\nThe author's main arguments are: 1) She should have asked first because it's his leave. 2) Approving leave through the boss is unprofessional. 3) He doesn't want to use his leave for an overseas trip. \n\nThe girlfriend's side is that she planned this as a surprise and paid for everything. Friends think he's ungrateful. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a relationship perspective, surprises can be a gesture of love, but they should respect each other's boundaries. Since the author's leave is his to manage, the girlfriend overstepped by not consulting him. She used their mutual boss, which could be a breach of trust if he felt it was unprofessional. However, the girlfriend's intention was to do something nice, but she didn't consider his preferences. \n\nThe author has a right to be upset because his time off is personal, and she made a decision that affects him without his input. Even if he's being a bit unenthusiastic, he has valid reasons. The friends saying he's ungrateful might not be considering the professional aspect and the lack of communication. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend should have discussed the plans with him before making arrangements. She should have asked if he wanted to take the leave and go on the trip. The fact that she didn't is the main issue here. He's standing up for his own preferences and professional concerns, which is reasonable.\n"
