Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is wrong here. So, the situation is that the girlfriend planned a surprise vacation for the author's birthday. She got flights, talked to their mutual boss in advance, and paid for everything. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, and he doesn't want to take an overseas trip. He's mad that she went behind his back and used company leave, which he thinks is unprofessional. His friends say he's being ungrateful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's intention was to do something nice for his birthday. She organized it secretly, which might be a common way to plan a surprise. She did contact their boss, which the author sees as a problem. But maybe she thought since she's in HR, she knows how to handle such things professionally. The author's issue is that he wasn't consulted. He prefers to relax and sleep instead of traveling, which is a valid personal preference. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't express his preferences before she acted. The girlfriend might have assumed he would like the trip. But by not asking him first, she didn't consider his wishes. The author's concern about professional boundaries is valid because coordinating leave through a mutual boss could be seen as inappropriate. \n\nSo, the key points are: 1) Did the girlfriend overstep by coordinating leave without his input? 2) Is the author wrong for not being excited about the surprise? \n\nThe author's friends say he's ungrateful, but he has a legitimate reason for not wanting to go. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him. The author's main issue is being consulted, which is important in a relationship. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for refusing, as he has a right to his preferences. The girlfriend's actions were well-intentioned but perhaps not well-considered. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
