Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend surprising the author with a paid vacation to Switzerland, which she arranged without consulting him. The author is upset because she didn't ask for his input and he prefers not to travel overseas. He also worries about the professional implications of her informing their boss about the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The girlfriend paid for the trip herself, using her own resources. She did ask their boss for leave in advance, which the author feels is unprofessional. The key issue here is consent. The girlfriend made a decision that affects both of them without consulting her partner. The author has a valid point in not wanting to go on the trip, especially since he didn't agree. However, the girlfriend might feel hurt because she put effort into planning this surprise and the author is rejecting it.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern about professional boundaries is valid. If their boss is aware of the trip, especially arranged for a couple's leave, it might create awkwardness or perceptions of favoritism. Also, the author has a right to his own preferences regarding how he uses his vacation time. \n\nThe author's friends say he's being ungrateful, but gratitude doesn't mean you have to accept something you don't want. The girlfriend should have discussed the plans with him before making the arrangements. The author's right to autonomy in his personal time is important here. \n\nSo, considering that the girlfriend didn't consult him despite the trip involving his leave and affecting their work environment, the author is justified in his decision to refuse. Therefore, he's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
