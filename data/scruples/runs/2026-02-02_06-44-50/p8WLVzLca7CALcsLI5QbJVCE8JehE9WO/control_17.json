Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author refused a surprise vacation to Switzerland paid for by his girlfriend. She arranged it without asking him and told their boss in advance. The author is annoyed because he thinks using leave for an overseas trip is unprofessional and he would prefer to relax and sleep instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend planned the trip without discussing it with him first. The author feels that using leave for an overseas trip could be risky for his career since they work in the same company and report to the same boss. Also, he might not have wanted to take a ski trip, preferring to relax. The girlfriend already paid for everything, so returning would cost her money. But the main issue is whether the author is wrong for declining the trip.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, she planned a surprise and spent money, expecting the author to be happy. The friends say he's ungrateful. But from the author's side, he feels his preferences were ignored, and there's a potential professional risk. \n\nSo, is he wrong? Well, he has valid reasons. His job could be affected if the boss thinks they're not using leave appropriately. Also, he was not consulted, which is a relationship issue. On the other hand, the girlfriend's gesture was thoughtful, and he's rejecting it without considering her effort. However, the author's concerns about professionalism and personal preference are legitimate. He's not obligated to accept something that goes against his wishes and could affect his career. The fact that he's not in the office much with her might mean they have different priorities. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. She should have asked him first. But he's standing by his decision because of his reasons. So, maybe he's not in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
