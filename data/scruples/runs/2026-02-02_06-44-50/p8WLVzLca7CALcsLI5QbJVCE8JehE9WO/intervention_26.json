Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a surprise vacation to Switzerland paid for by the girlfriend. The key points are that the girlfriend arranged the trip without consulting the author, informed their boss months in advance without the author's input, and the author is upset because they prefer to use their leave time to relax and sleep, not travel overseas.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The girlfriend did something thoughtful and surprising, which is usually a good thing. But the author is in IT and their boss is the same as the girlfriend's in HR. The girlfriend approached the boss without the author's knowledge. The author is concerned about the professional implications of taking leave without prior approval. Also, they feel their preferences weren't considered.\n\nThe author's main argument is that they should have been consulted first. The girlfriend didn't ask, so he felt it was his right to refuse. The friends are saying he's ungrateful, but the author's reasoning is about personal preference and professionalism. \n\nOn the girlfriend's side, she might have thought the surprise was a nice gesture, especially since they don't see each other much. She might have assumed he would be happy. However, she bypassed the author's input, which is a problem. Even if it's a surprise, planning a two-week trip that affects work and incurs significant costs without checking with the other person first is a big oversight.\n\nProfessionally, the author is right to be concerned. Taking leave for a surprise trip without his knowledge could be seen as unprofessional if he didn't agree. Also, he has his own preference for using the leave time. The girlfriend's approach might have been overstepping, even if well-intentioned. \n\nSo, the author's refusal is based on valid reasons: lack of communication, potential career risk, and personal preference. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him before making the arrangements. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
