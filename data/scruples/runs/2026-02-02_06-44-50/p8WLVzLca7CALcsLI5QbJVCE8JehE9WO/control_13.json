Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong. The situation is about a surprise vacation by the girlfriend, which the author refused because they felt it was unprofessional and they didn't want to go overseas. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend planned a surprise two-week trip to Switzerland, paid for it, and told the boss in advance. The author is in IT, the girlfriend in HR, same company but different branches. They report to the same big boss. The author is upset because the girlfriend arranged leave without consulting him, which he thinks is unprofessional and could affect his career. He also prefers to relax at home instead of traveling.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is wrong for refusing the trip. The girlfriend's argument is that she planned it as a surprise, already paid, and the author should be grateful. His friends say he's ungrateful. But the author's points are about unprofessionalism and lack of consultation.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the girlfriend made a generous gesture, possibly without considering his preferences. On the other, she went behind his back to talk to their boss, which could indeed be unprofessional, especially since they report to the same boss. The author has valid concerns about how his leave was arranged without his consent, which might affect his job if the boss found out. Also, he didn't want to go, so forcing him could lead to resentment.\n\nBut maybe the girlfriend thought it was a nice surprise, not realizing he might not want to go. However, the key point is that she didn't ask him. Using company leave for a vacation without his input is a big decision. The author's reason for not going is valid\u2014his own preference and professional concerns. So, is he in the wrong for refusing? Well, if the trip was already paid for, returning it could cause her financial loss. But the main issue is the violation of his autonomy in the decision-making process.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend overstepped by arranging leave without his consent, then the author isn't in the wrong for objecting. His friends saying he's ungrateful might be missing the point about the unprofessionalism and lack of communication. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He has legitimate reasons for his refusal, and the girlfriend should have discussed it with him first.\n"
