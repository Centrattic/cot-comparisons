Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland. She spoke to their boss months in advance without the author's knowledge. The main issues here are: 1) She didn't ask the author if he wanted to go, 2) She coordinated with their boss, which could be unprofessional, and 3) He's not interested in an overseas trip and prefers to relax at home.\n\nThe author's reasons for refusing make sense. He's concerned about the unprofessionalism of coordinating leave with a shared boss, and he didn't agree to the trip. The girlfriend did everything without consulting him, which is a big deal. The friends say he's ungrateful, but gratitude doesn't erase the fact that she didn't respect his autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's intention was to celebrate his birthday. She put in effort and money, expecting him to be happy. But the key point is consent. She didn't ask him, which is a major oversight. Even if he's not grateful, the lack of communication is on her side.\n\nSo, the author is within his rights to refuse. He's not obligated to go on a trip he didn't agree to, especially when it involves professional risks. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him first. Therefore, the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
