Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a girlfriend who planned a surprise vacation, paid for it, and got leave approved from their mutual boss without the person's consent.\n\nFirst, the author is upset because the girlfriend arranged the trip without asking him. He didn't want to go on an overseas trip and preferred to relax. The key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend made a big decision involving his time and work without discussing it with him, which he found unprofessional and intrusive. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend did plan the surprise, which can be seen as a thoughtful gesture. She did check with their boss to get the leave, which she might have thought was necessary. But the main issue here is that she didn't ask him if he wanted to go, even though the trip uses his leave. His preference is to use the time for rest, which is valid. \n\nThe author's friends think he's being ungrateful, but the core of the problem is that his consent wasn't sought. The girlfriend's actions were well-intentioned, but the lack of communication about his preferences is a problem. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's not wrong for not wanting to go, especially since it's his leave. He expressed his disapproval because she didn't ask. The girlfriend's mistake was not consulting him. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing. The answer should be B (No).\n"
