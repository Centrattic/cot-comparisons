Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a surprise vacation from the girlfriend that the author refused. The author's reasons are that the girlfriend didn't ask him first, used their boss to arrange leave without consulting him, and he prefers to use his leave time to relax and sleep. The friends say he's ungrateful, but he thinks she should have asked.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend planned a surprise, which might have been a nice gesture. She did use their boss, which the author sees as unprofessional. But maybe she thought it was a good idea to plan something special. The author might feel that his preferences were ignored. He didn't want to go on an overseas trip and would have preferred to relax. \n\nBut wait, does the fact that she arranged it without asking make it wrong? The author has the right to his own preferences. If she didn't communicate with him about the trip, maybe that's where the issue is. On the other hand, the author didn't express his feelings until it was too late, even though he was annoyed. Maybe he should have communicated his preferences earlier. \n\nAlso, the fact that they work in the same company and she involved their boss might be a problem. But the girlfriend's intention was to plan a surprise, so she might not have realized the unprofessional aspect the author is pointing out. \n\nThe author's friends think he's being ungrateful. But gratitude doesn't mean agreeing to everything. The key issue is consent and communication. The author's right to decide how he uses his leave is important. She should have discussed it with him first. \n\nSo, the author's refusal is based on valid reasons, like lack of communication and unprofessional handling of leave. The girlfriend's actions, while well-meaning, overstepped by not consulting him. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
