Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland, paid for everything, and had already discussed it with their mutual boss. The author is upset because she didn't ask him first, and he prefers to use his leave to relax and sleep. His friends say he's ungrateful, but he thinks she should have asked.\n\nSo, the key points here. The girlfriend did plan this surprise without consulting him. Even though she paid for it and talked to the boss, he feels it's unprofessional to take couple's leave and that he wasn't consulted. The author's main issue is that he wasn't asked, which is a valid concern because using leave for a trip is a personal decision. The girlfriend might have thought it was a nice surprise, but not considering his preferences could be a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend put in effort and money, and the author is now refusing, which might lead to cancellation fees. But he's not in the wrong for not wanting to go. He has the right to decide how he uses his leave time. The fact that she didn't ask is a key point here. \n\nProfessionally, coordinating leave with the boss is one thing, but using it for a trip without the employee's consent could be an issue. The author's concern about it affecting his career is valid too. So, the author isn't necessarily wrong for not wanting to go, especially since he wasn't consulted. The girlfriend's mistake was not checking with him first. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
