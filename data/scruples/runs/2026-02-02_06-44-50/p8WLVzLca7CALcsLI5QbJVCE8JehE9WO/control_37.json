Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation planned by his girlfriend. The girlfriend paid for it and got approval from their mutual boss without consulting him first.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons: he's not happy that his girlfriend went to their boss without his input, which he sees as unprofessional and potentially risky for his career. He also didn't want to use his leave for an overseas trip and would prefer to relax and sleep. He didn't ask her to return the tickets because she'd face cancellation fees, but he's firm about not going without prior discussion.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that she planned a surprise, maybe to make the birthday extra special. She took the initiative, which might be her way of showing love and effort. However, she didn't consider his preferences and the potential professional implications.\n\nKey points to consider: \n1. Communication: The girlfriend didn't talk to him about the plans, which is a big deal. Important decisions involving work should involve both parties, especially when it's about time off and company policies.\n2. Professionalism: Using their boss without the employee's consent could be seen as crossing a boundary. Work-related decisions should ideally come from the employee, not a partner.\n3. Autonomy: The author has the right to decide how he uses his vacation time. Forcing a trip without his consent might infringe on his personal choice.\n4. Intentions vs. Actions: The girlfriend's intention might have been good, but the method was flawed. Surprises can be nice, but when they involve significant professional risks and personal preferences, they should be discussed.\n\nThe friends think the author is ungrateful, but the issue isn't about gratitude but about respecting his autonomy and work-life decisions. The girlfriend's actions could have long-term professional consequences for him, which is a valid concern. He's not being ungrateful; he's standing up for his own needs and the appropriate way to handle work-related matters.\n\nSo, the author's stance is about boundaries and professional integrity. The girlfriend's mistake was not consulting him before making such a significant decision. Therefore, the author is justified in his refusal and not in the wrong.\n"
