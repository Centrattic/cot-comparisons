Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend planning a surprise vacation funded by her and paid for in advance, but the author is refusing to go because she didn't ask him first and he doesn't want to take a vacation like that.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend arranged a two-week trip to Switzerland, used their mutual boss to get leave, and paid for everything. The author is upset because she didn't consult him about using his leave for an overseas trip. He prefers to relax and sleep during his time off. He's refusing to go, and now she's upset. Friends say he's being ungrateful.\n\nSo, the main issue here is consent and communication. The girlfriend made a big decision without discussing it with her partner. Even though it's a surprise, the author values his time off and has preferences about how to spend it. The fact that she involved their boss without his input is a red flag, especially in a professional setting. Using company resources (the boss's approval) for personal plans without the employee's consent could be seen as unprofessional, which the author is validly concerned about.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have intended to make the author happy with a nice surprise. She went through the trouble of organizing it, paid for it, and he's rejecting it. But the problem is that he didn't have a say in it. The author's preference to use his leave in a different way is his right. He's not obligated to accept a gift that uses his personal time, especially when it was arranged without his consent.\n\nThe friends saying he's ungrateful might not be considering his perspective. The author isn't ungrateful for the gesture, but he's standing his ground on the principle of not having control over his own time. The girlfriend's approach was to plan it without discussion, which is where the issue lies. The author isn't wrong for not wanting to participate in something that was arranged without his input, especially involving professional contacts. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The main fault is on the girlfriend for not communicating and making assumptions. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
