Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend surprising her boyfriend with a paid vacation to Switzerland, but he's upset because she didn't ask him first and told their mutual boss about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend organized a surprise two-week trip, which she paid for. She went to their boss months in advance to get leave approved without consulting him. The author is upset because he doesn't want to use his leave for an overseas trip and prefers to relax and sleep. He also thinks it's unprofessional to have the boss involved in a personal matter like this. He told her he wouldn't go because she didn't ask first, which upset her.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The user says they think the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both perspectives. \n\nFrom the author's side: He didn't know about the trip until it was arranged. He might feel that his preferences are being overridden. Using company leave for a trip without his input could be an issue, especially if he's not interested. Also, involving the boss in personal matters might be seen as unprofessional. He's concerned about his career, which is valid if the company culture frowns on such things.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's side: She wanted to do something nice for his birthday. She went to the trouble of planning and paying for the trip, thinking he would be happy. She might have assumed he would be excited and not mind using company leave. She might feel hurt that he's not appreciative.\n\nBut here's the thing: The author had the right to choose. The girlfriend made a major decision that affects him without his consent. Even if her intentions were good, not consulting him is a problem. The fact that she involved their boss adds another layer, especially if it's unprofessional. The author's concern about his career is valid. He's in a position where he's forced to take leave he didn't plan for, which could conflict with work responsibilities or his personal preferences.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend might not have realized how important it was for him to have control over his leave. The surprise might have been a nice gesture, but it's important to respect the other person's wishes and boundaries. By not asking first, she made a decision that affects him directly. That's where the author's stance comes from. He's not ungrateful for the gesture, but he values his autonomy in deciding how to use his leave.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He has valid reasons for his decision. The girlfriend should have discussed the trip with him first. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
