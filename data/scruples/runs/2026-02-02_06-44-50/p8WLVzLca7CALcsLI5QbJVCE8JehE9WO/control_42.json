Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to go on a surprise vacation paid by their girlfriend. The setup is that the girlfriend planned a two-week trip to Switzerland, got approval from their boss without consulting the author, and now he's upset because she didn't ask him first.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The key points here are consent and communication. The author is not happy that his leave was used without his input, which is a valid concern. Using company leave for a trip without discussing it with him could be seen as overstepping, especially since he prefers to use his time to relax at home. The girlfriend did make arrangements, including flights and resorts, which complicates things because she's already spent money.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's actions: she talked to their boss, which the author finds unprofessional. Even if they report to the same boss, using company leave for personal travel without the employee's consent could be problematic. The author's job in IT might have specific leave policies that require employee approval, so her action might risk their careers. \n\nThe author's refusal is based on not being asked first. He has a right to control his own schedule. The girlfriend's surprise, while well-intentioned, didn't respect his autonomy. The fact that he mentioned he'd prefer to relax at home shows his personal preference, which she didn't consider. \n\nThe friends saying he's ungrateful might be missing the point. Gratitude is important, but consent and mutual decision-making in significant plans are also crucial. The girlfriend should have discussed it with him instead of assuming he'd be happy to go. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because he's standing up for his boundaries. The girlfriend's actions were overreaching, and his refusal is a reasonable response. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
