Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a surprise vacation paid for by his girlfriend, but he refused to go. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend planned a surprise trip, which is a nice gesture. She went through the effort of getting company approval in advance. But the author is upset because she didn't consult him first. He feels that using his leave for an overseas trip is unprofessional, especially since they work under the same boss. Also, he prefers to relax and sleep instead of traveling.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend made decisions without his input, which he finds problematic. While the surprise was thoughtful, he has valid concerns about professional boundaries and personal preferences. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel she was trying to do something special. But the main issue is that she didn't ask him first. The author's friends say he's ungrateful, but maybe they're not seeing his perspective. \n\nIs he in the wrong for refusing? If the girlfriend had asked, maybe he would have said no, but since she didn't, he's justified in his refusal. His reasons are about professional and personal preferences. So, the answer would likely be B (he's not in the wrong) because he's standing up for his boundaries and preferences, which are valid.\n"
