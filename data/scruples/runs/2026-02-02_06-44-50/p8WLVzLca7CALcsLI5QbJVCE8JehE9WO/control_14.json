Important to note that we report to the same big boss even though we\u2019re in different departments. Anyways, my birthday was two days ago. My girlfriend and I celebrated by going to a fancy restaurant and having a glass of wine after. Then she starts babbling about a \u201csurprise\u201d she has for me, and gives me an envelope. In the envelope are return flights to Switzerland, for a two-week holiday! Immediately I began to wonder how this holiday would work considering I hadn\u2019t applied for leave, but before I could even ask, she said she talked to our boss months in advance and told him to keep it a secret. I didn\u2019t say anything but I was really annoyed. Asking our boss for couples\u2019 leave is just unprofessional and could jeopardize my career. Not only that, but she never asked me if I was okay with using my leave for an overseas holiday. I would much prefer using that time to relax and sleep. I was going to suggest her returning the tickets but she has already paid for everything, including ski resorts, and I figure she would incur various cancellation fees. I just believe that she should have asked me, because I do not want to travel overseas while on leave. I guess I didn\u2019t act as enthused as she wanted me to because she asked me why I was unhappy, and I told her that I would refuse to go as she should have asked me first. She\u2019s annoyed at me. My close friends are telling me that I\u2019m being ungrateful and that I should just go. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing a surprise vacation that the girlfriend paid for. The author works in IT, girlfriend in HR at the same company. They have a boss in common but work different schedules.\n\nSo the girlfriend gave him surprise tickets to Switzerland. She told their boss months in advance to arrange it as a surprise. The author is upset because she didn't ask him, and he doesn't want to take an overseas trip. He's worried about the professionalism of the boss being involved in their leave for a vacation, and prefers to relax at home. His friends say he's ungrateful, but he feels she should have asked first.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about consent and communication. The girlfriend made a big decision without consulting him, which is a problem. She used company resources (boss's approval) for a personal trip, which could be unprofessional, as the author points out. Also, he didn't want an overseas trip, so she went ahead anyway. \n\nOn the other hand, she did plan this surprise, maybe thinking he would like it. But the fact that she didn't ask is a major issue. The author's preference to use leave time for rest at home is valid. The friends saying he's ungrateful might not consider that he's not against the vacation itself, but the method of how it was arranged. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. Because the girlfriend didn't communicate her plans, and the author has valid concerns about professionalism and personal preference. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
