They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did something wrong here. So the situation is, they hired a cleaner through an app, but they lied about the size of their house. The app uses the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to determine how long the cleaner will work. The author didn't list all the rooms because they only wanted the cleaner to focus on the downstairs. The cleaner ended up finishing the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs to clean other areas, but when they found out there were more rooms than listed, they got angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. When you use an app like that, there's probably some terms and conditions they agreed to. If the app calculates hours based on the number of rooms, then providing false information might mean they're not following the app's guidelines. The cleaner might have been promised a job based on the listed rooms, so when the author didn't list all the rooms, it could be seen as deceptive. The cleaner might feel like they were misled about the scope of work, even if the author said they could do as much as they wanted. \n\nAlso, the cleaner might have expected to work the full time based on the listed rooms. If they finished the downstairs quickly and had time left, maybe they expected to use that time on the unlisted rooms. But the author didn't mention those rooms upfront, so the cleaner felt cheated. The author's intention was to have only the downstairs cleaned, but the cleaner might have thought they were being paid to clean all listed rooms. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did clarify when the cleaner arrived that the focus was on the downstairs and that the upstairs was optional. But maybe the cleaner relied on the app's calculation, which was based on the incorrect information. The app's system might have allocated hours based on the number of rooms, leading the cleaner to expect a certain amount of work. The author's manipulation of the app's inputs could have led to a misunderstanding about the expected work duration and scope. \n\nIn terms of ethics, being upfront is important. Even if the author's intention was to save money by not hiring for the full time, not disclosing the actual size of the house could be seen as dishonest. The cleaner might feel that their time is being undervalued if they were misled about the actual task. However, the author did specify during the meeting that the upstairs wasn't important, but the initial setup on the app was misleading. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for not being transparent about the house's size when booking the cleaner. Even if they tried to explain later, the initial input was false, leading to the cleaner's confusion and anger. The app's system relies on accurate information to allocate time, so manipulating that could be seen as deceptive. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any other angle. Maybe the app's terms don't strictly enforce the listed rooms, but generally, providing false info for a service like that is problematic. Yeah, I think A is the right choice.\n"
