They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves hiring a cleaner through an app where the number of bedrooms and bathrooms determines the cleaning time. The poster intentionally listed fewer rooms than there actually are to get a lower price. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then got angry when the poster showed him the remaining upstairs areas.\n\nFirst, the app's system is based on the number of rooms to determine the time. By lying about the size, the poster effectively got a shorter service time. The cleaner, following the app's parameters, expected to clean the listed number of rooms. The poster then asked the cleaner to do more than the agreed-upon time, even though they told the cleaner to only focus on the downstairs. However, the cleaner might have thought the total time was based on the listed rooms, so working faster and having extra time might not mean they should be responsible for more rooms. The poster didn't hire the cleaner for the full house, just the downstairs, but the cleaner's contract (as per the app's terms) might be based on the listed rooms. The confusion here is whether the cleaner's agreement was to clean the listed rooms for the given time or if the time allows for more flexibility. If the app's terms specify that the cleaned rooms must match the listed ones, then the poster is in the wrong for providing false info. The cleaner's anger might stem from being underpaid for the actual work or feeling misled. The poster's intention to save money by misrepresenting the house size could be the root of the issue. Therefore, the answer would likely be A.\n"
