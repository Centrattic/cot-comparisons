They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves hiring a cleaner through an app where the user provided fewer bedrooms and bathrooms than the actual house has to get a lower cost estimate. The cleaner ended up doing the downstairs quickly and then got upset about the upstairs not being listed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The app uses the number of rooms to determine the hours. By underreporting, the user got a 4-hour service instead of the actual required hours. The user's intention was only to clean the downstairs, and the cleaner was supposed to do upstairs if time allowed. But the cleaner was angry because the actual number of rooms was higher than listed.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that they didn't want to pay for more hours since the upstairs wasn't a priority. However, the cleaner might have expected that the quoted time covers the listed rooms, so when there are more rooms, the time was insufficient, leading to incomplete work. The user might have misled the cleaner by not providing accurate information, which could be seen as deceptive.\n\nOn the other hand, the user might argue that they communicated the priority areas and that the cleaner was supposed to use the time as they saw fit. But the problem here is the initial misrepresentation. The app likely factors in the number of rooms to estimate the required time for a full clean. If the user underreported, they effectively manipulated the system to get a lower price, which might not account for all the spaces they have. The cleaner's job might be to clean all listed rooms within the quoted time, but when the actual rooms exceed that, the cleaner feels underpaid or the user feels the cleaner was too quick but then didn't finish the upstairs.\n\nThe key issue is whether providing incorrect information to an app that determines pricing and service scope is acceptable. The user didn't disclose the actual size, leading to a mismatch between the service provided and the actual needs. The cleaner's anger might stem from the fact that the job was underspecified, leading to a situation where they can't complete the work as per the original terms. The user benefits from a lower cost but the cleaner ends up in a position where they can't do the job as intended, leading to dissatisfaction.\n\nSo, considering the principles of honesty in contractual agreements, even if informal, the user misrepresented the facts to get a cheaper service. The app's system relies on accurate input to determine the appropriate service. By lying about the number of rooms, the user created an unfair situation where the cleaner's time was insufficient for the actual space. The user's defense is that they communicated the priority areas, but the initial misrepresentation is still problematic. Therefore, the user is in the wrong for not being truthful about the house's size when using the app's service calculation.\n"
