They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app, and they misrepresented the size of their house to get a 4-hour service instead of the actual needed time. The cleaner ended up finishing the downstairs quickly and was upset about the upstairs not being listed, even though the user told him to focus on the downstairs and do what he can.\n\nFirst, the user intentionally lied about the number of rooms to get a cheaper or shorter service. The app's system probably calculates hours based on the number of rooms. By underreporting, the user likely got a lower price than they should have paid if they listed all the rooms. The cleaner was expecting to clean a smaller space but ended up with extra time because the user's house was bigger than listed. \n\nThe user then took the cleaner upstairs, which might have led the cleaner to believe he was being asked to clean those areas. However, the user's main responsibility was to the time they paid for, not the entire house. The cleaner might feel misled because the user didn't list the actual size, leading to the cleaner thinking he was hired for a smaller job. The user's explanation that the cleaner only needed to do what he could in the time paid for might not matter if the contract (as per the app's terms) is based on the listed rooms. \n\nThe cleaner's anger could stem from feeling that he was underpaid for the work he did, even though the user didn't ask him to clean the upstairs. The user's siblings might have different expectations, but the cleaner's job was based on the information provided. So, the user's lie about the house size is the core issue here. Even if the user didn't force the cleaner to do upstairs work, the initial misrepresentation is problematic. Therefore, the user is in the wrong for not being honest about the house's size, leading to a misunderstanding and the cleaner's frustration.\n"
