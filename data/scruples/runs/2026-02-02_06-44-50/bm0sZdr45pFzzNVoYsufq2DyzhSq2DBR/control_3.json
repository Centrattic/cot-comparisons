They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that they hired a cleaner through an app, but lied about the size of the house to get a 4-hour service instead of a longer one. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, but got angry when shown more rooms than listed.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The app's system is based on the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to determine hours. The user didn't input the actual numbers, which would've resulted in more hours, so they manipulated the info to get a shorter time. They told the cleaner upfront that only the downstairs was important and to do the upstairs if there's time. But the cleaner was upset about the discrepancy in the house size.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, they provided false information to get a lower price or shorter commitment. But the actual problem might be about the contract terms. If the app's terms require accurate listing of rooms, then the user violated that. However, the user's intention was to only have the cleaner work on the downstairs, and the cleaner was supposed to use the remaining time for the upstairs if possible. The cleaner might feel misled because the initial assessment was based on the number of rooms, which affects the time allocated. So if the user didn't list all rooms, the cleaner might not have enough time to do even the downstairs properly, but in this case, the cleaner finished downstairs quickly and had extra time. The user's approach may have led to the cleaner expecting more work for the 4 hours, but the user wanted to limit the scope. \n\nThe user could be in the wrong for not being honest about the house size, which the app uses to calculate the time. Even though they told the cleaner the priority, the initial listing was a lie. The cleaner might feel that they were promised a certain amount of work for the time, and the user's deception caused extra work that wasn't expected. On the other hand, the user might argue that the app's system is rigid and they needed a shorter time, but that doesn't excuse providing false information. The cleaner's job is to clean based on the listed rooms, so if the user didn't list them, maybe the cleaner isn't obligated to clean them. But the cleaner might have planned the job based on the provided info and felt it was unfair. \n\nI think the main issue is the user's dishonesty. They misrepresented the house size, which could be considered a breach of the service agreement. Even if they intended to use the extra time for the upstairs, the initial deceit is problematic. The cleaner's anger is about being misled, even if the user didn't force him to do the extra work. So the answer is A, the user is in the wrong.\n"
