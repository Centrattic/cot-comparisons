They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is they hired a cleaner through an app, and they lied about the number of rooms to get a lower hourly rate. The cleaner ended up finishing the downstairs quickly and then got angry when they showed him the upstairs areas, which weren't listed. The author says that the downstairs was the only important part and the cleaner could do the upstairs if there was time. But the cleaner was upset and said it wasn't what was listed.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about honesty and expectations. When using a service app, usually, you list your home's details accurately to get an accurate quote. The author manipulated the inputs to get a 4-hour job instead of more, which the app probably calculates based on the size. The app's algorithm likely factors in time estimates based on the number of rooms. By underreporting, the author is essentially getting a cheaper service than what's needed for the actual house size. The cleaner probably expected to clean the listed rooms, and when faced with more rooms than specified, they felt misled. \n\nThe author's defense is that they told the cleaner to focus on downstairs and only do upstairs if there was time. But the cleaner's reaction was anger because the initial listing was deceptive. The app's terms might specify that the quoted time is based on the listed rooms, so the client is responsible for accurate information. The cleaner might have been underpaid for the job if the app's system is based on room count. \n\nAlso, even if the author told the cleaner on arrival, the cleaner might have agreed to the job under false premises. The author's manipulation of the app's input could be considered dishonest. The cleaner's anger might stem from feeling exploited or not being paid fairly for the actual work expected. \n\nSo, the author intentionally lied to get a lower cost, which led to the cleaner being undercompensated for the time they thought they were hired for. Even if the author tried to adjust expectations on the spot, the initial deceit might still be problematic. The cleaner's right to be upset could be justified because the agreement's basis was false information. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
