They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author hired a cleaner through an app and didn't list the actual number of bedrooms and bathrooms because they only wanted the cleaner to focus on the downstairs. The cleaner finished quickly and then got upset when shown the upstairs areas, thinking the house was larger than listed.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the terms of the service. The app's system determines the hours based on the number of rooms. The author intentionally provided incorrect information to get a shorter job time. The cleaner's contract was based on the listed rooms, so if the actual house has more rooms, the cleaner might feel misled.\n\nThe author's defense is that they told the cleaner to only focus on the downstairs and that he could do as much as he had time for. However, the cleaner might argue that the job description was based on the initial information, and the author's actions led to an underpayment or unmet expectations. Even if the author didn't specify the rooms, the app's terms likely require accurate input. The cleaner's anger could stem from feeling that their work was undervalued or that the service was misrepresented.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have known if the app required strict adherence to room counts. But generally, when you use a service like this, providing accurate details is expected. The cleaner's job scope was determined by the listed rooms, so the author's manipulation of that info could be seen as deceptive. The author then tried to limit the cleaner's tasks verbally, but the contract was based on the initial data. The cleaner might feel that the author is trying to get more service for less money by misrepresenting the house size.\n\nSo, considering these points, the author did provide false information to the app, which affects the service terms. Even if the cleaner was told to focus on downstairs, the initial data was incorrect. The cleaner's right to be upset is understandable because their job scope was based on the listed rooms. The author might be in the wrong for not being honest about the house's size, leading to a misunderstanding about the job's scope and payment.\n"
