They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about hiring a cleaner through an app that uses the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to determine the hours. The author lied about the number of rooms to get a 4-hour booking, intending the cleaner to focus on the downstairs. The cleaner finished quickly and was upset about the extra rooms upstairs.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The app's system uses the house's size to calculate the time, so if you list fewer rooms, you get fewer hours. The author didn't list all the rooms to get a lower hour count, but then expected the cleaner to use the remaining time for other areas. The cleaner was upset because they felt the actual size was misrepresented.\n\nFrom a contractual standpoint, when you use a service that bases pricing or duration on specific information, providing false information could be an issue. The app's terms likely assume that the listed rooms correspond to the work to be done. By not listing all the rooms, the author might have created a discrepancy between what the cleaner expected (based on the listed rooms) and the actual work available. The cleaner might feel they were misled into accepting a job that required more work than anticipated for the same pay.\n\nEthically, the author intended to have the cleaner focus on specific areas but didn't communicate clearly that the unlisted rooms existed. Even though they told the cleaner to prioritize downstairs, the initial listing was misleading. The cleaner's anger could stem from feeling underpaid or overworked, as the job took less time than expected, leaving extra time that wasn't used as anticipated.\n\nThe author might argue they were upfront once the cleaner arrived, but the initial misrepresentation on the app could still be problematic. The cleaner might rely on the app's assessment for planning their work. If the app's algorithm is designed to allocate time based on the listed rooms, the author's manipulation of that data could be seen as deceptive.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did inform the cleaner in person about the priorities, so there's a counter-argument that the verbal communication was clear. However, the written listing on the app was falsified, which is part of the formal booking process. The cleaner might not have agreed to the extra work if the correct number of rooms was listed, which could have increased the time and cost.\n\nIn conclusion, the author provided false information that led to a mismatch between the agreed-upon service and the actual task. Even if the cleaner was informed afterward, the initial misrepresentation is likely the root of the cleaner's frustration. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
