They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not listing the full size of the house when hiring a cleaner. The app's system is based on the number of rooms to determine the hours. The author intentionally underreported the rooms to get a 4-hour service instead of a longer one, knowing that the cleaner would only be paid for 4 hours. \n\nThe cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then was expected to help with the upstairs. However, the cleaner got upset because the actual number of rooms was more than listed. The author explained that the cleaner only needed to work for the 4 hours and could leave after that. The cleaner was angry, and the author is now questioning if they did something wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author deceive the cleaner? The app's terms probably state that the job includes all the listed rooms. By not listing all rooms accurately, the author might have misled the cleaner. The cleaner expects to clean all the rooms listed in the job description. If the job was listed with fewer rooms, the cleaner might have priced the job based on that. The author could be in the wrong for not being transparent about the actual size of the house. The cleaner's job was to clean the listed rooms, but since they were listed as fewer, the cleaner might not be responsible for the extra rooms. However, the author also told the cleaner not to worry about finishing the upstairs, so the cleaner might have thought they were supposed to clean all the rooms listed, which were fewer. The cleaner's anger could stem from the discrepancy between the listed rooms and the actual number. The app's terms likely require accurate room counts to determine the job scope. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for misrepresenting the house's size, leading to a misunderstanding about the job's scope.\n"
