They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. So, the scenario is that they hired a cleaner through an app. The app requires selecting the number of rooms (bedrooms and bathrooms) to determine the cleaning time. The user lied about the number of rooms to get a 4-hour cleaning, intending for the cleaner to focus only on the downstairs. The cleaner finished quickly and was upset about having to clean the upstairs, which wasn't listed. The user told the cleaner that if they had time, they could do the upstairs but not necessary. The cleaner got angry and the user is questioning if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. If the app uses the room count to estimate the required hours, then the user might have misled the system. The cleaner probably expects that their time is allocated based on the accurate room count. By providing false information, the user might be underpaying for the actual work. Even though the user only wanted the downstairs cleaned, the cleaner might feel that they are being asked to do more than what they were paid for. The user didn't mention the extra rooms during the booking, which could be a breach of the app's terms. However, the user tried to clarify the priorities upon arrival. The cleaner's anger might stem from feeling that they were shortchanged or that the user was deceptive. On the other hand, the user might not have been aware that the room count was strictly enforced. But since the user had control over the information provided to the app, they might be at fault for not being honest. The key points are: misleading the app's system, not informing the cleaner upfront about the intention to limit the scope, and the cleaner feeling they were not properly compensated for the actual work. So, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they misrepresented the job's scope to get a lower price, which could be seen as unethical or a violation of the service agreement.\n"
