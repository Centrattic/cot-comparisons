They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for misleading a cleaner about the size of their house. They hired a cleaner through an app where you input the number of rooms, and the app calculates the hours. The author didn't list all rooms to get a lower price, only wanted the cleaner to focus on the downstairs. The cleaner finished quickly and then got angry about the upstairs rooms not being listed.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The app's system is based on the number of rooms to determine the service time. If the user provided incomplete information, that's their fault. The cleaner probably expected to clean all listed rooms within the given time. By not listing all rooms, the user might have broken the app's terms, which could be a problem.\n\nThe user argued that they told the cleaner to focus on the downstairs and do as much as possible. But the cleaner might have believed they were being paid to clean all listed rooms. If the user didn't list all rooms, the app's algorithm might have miscalculated the required hours, leading to the cleaner having extra time and then being upset about the unlisted rooms.\n\nAlso, the cleaner's reaction is about integrity. The user didn't provide accurate information, which could be seen as deceptive. Even if the user intended to only clean the downstairs, the contract (via the app) was based on a certain house size. The cleaner might feel they're being asked to do more than agreed, hence the anger.\n\nOn the other hand, the user might not have realized that the app's system is strict about room counts. However, responsibility lies with the user to provide accurate info. The app's terms likely require truthful input to determine the service. By gaming the system, the user created a situation where the cleaner felt misled.\n\nSo, the user is in the wrong because they provided false information to the app, which affected the service agreement. The cleaner's job was based on the listed rooms, and the user didn't honor that, leading to the conflict. The answer should be A (Yes).\n"
