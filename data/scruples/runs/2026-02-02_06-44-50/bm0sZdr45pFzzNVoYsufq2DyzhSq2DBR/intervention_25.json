They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author hired a cleaner through an app and lied about the size of the house to get a 4-hour rate instead of more. The cleaner cleaned the downstairs quickly and then the author took him upstairs, but the cleaner got angry because there were more rooms than listed.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the expectations set by the app. The app's pricing is based on the number of rooms, right? So if you input fewer rooms, you get a lower hour rate. The author manipulated this by not listing the actual number of rooms to get a cheaper rate. That's a key point. The cleaner probably expects that the hours they're paid for are sufficient for the rooms listed. \n\nThen, when the cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and the author asked them to do the upstairs, even though they didn't have to, the cleaner was upset. The author said the cleaner didn't have to finish everything upstairs, just do what they had time for. But the cleaner felt wronged because the initial information was incorrect. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they didn't want to pay more for the upstairs, so they lied about the number of rooms. However, the cleaner's contract might be based on the assumption that the listed rooms are the only ones they need to clean. By not being truthful, the author might have created an unfair situation where the cleaner is working more than what was paid for, even if the author didn't force them to stay. \n\nThe cleaner's reaction is valid because the author misrepresented the job's scope. The cleaner might feel that they were misled into accepting a job that took longer than expected, even if they weren't forced to do the extra work. The author's action of lying to get a lower rate is the root of the problem here. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they misrepresented the job details to get a cheaper rate and then tried to have the cleaner work more without additional payment. Even if the cleaner was given the option to do the upstairs, the initial deception is problematic. The cleaner's anger is a reaction to being misled. So the answer would be A.\n"
