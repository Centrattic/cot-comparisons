They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app where the app determines the hours based on the number of rooms listed. The user intentionally underreported the number of rooms to get a 4-hour service, but the cleaner finished downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, becoming angry when he realized there were more rooms than listed.\n\nFirst, the user lied about the size of the house. That's a key point. When you use an app, you're entering into an agreement where the terms are set by the app's system. The user manipulated the input to get a cheaper or shorter service, which probably isn't the app's intended process. The app's algorithm is designed to estimate the time needed based on the number of rooms, so lying about that could be a breach of the service's terms.\n\nThen, the cleaner was hired based on the assumption that the job would take 4 hours. The user told the cleaner to focus on the downstairs, but the cleaner might have had a contract or understanding that the listed rooms were the scope of the job. By not listing all rooms, the user might have misled the cleaner. Even if the user tried to explain that the cleaner could work on the upstairs if there was time, the initial contract (as per the app's system) was based on a different set of rooms. The cleaner might feel that the user didn't honor the agreed-upon terms, hence the anger.\n\nThe user argues that the cleaner didn't need to finish everything and could leave after the time was up. However, the cleaner's job might be to clean the listed areas within the estimated time. If the user didn't list all the rooms, the time estimate might be based on a smaller job, leading to the cleaner finishing early and then having to deal with unexpected work. The cleaner might not be paid for the extra time or might feel that the user is trying to get more work out of them without additional compensation.\n\nThe user's intention was to save money by not listing all rooms, but the cleaner's perspective is that they were hired to clean the listed areas, and the user misrepresented the job's scope. The cleaner's anger is justified because the user didn't be honest about the house's size and the actual work required. The user's explanation that \"he can do as much as he has time for\" might not align with the app's terms, which likely assume the cleaner works on the listed rooms within the estimated hours. If the app's system is designed to allocate time based on rooms, then finishing early and having extra time might not translate to additional work if the rooms aren't listed.\n\nIn terms of ethics, lying to get a cheaper service when the service's pricing is based on accurate information is generally considered wrong. The user prioritized their own benefit over the cleaner's right to be informed about the job's actual requirements. The cleaner might feel disrespected and cheated, leading to the negative interaction.\n\nSo, considering all this, the user is in the wrong for misleading the cleaner and the service about the house's size. The answer should be A.\n"
