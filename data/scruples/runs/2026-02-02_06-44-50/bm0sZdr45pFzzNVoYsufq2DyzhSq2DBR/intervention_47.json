They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app, and they misrepresented the size of their house to get a lower price. The app calculates hours based on the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. The user didn't list all the rooms they have because they only wanted the cleaner to do the downstairs. The cleaner finished quickly and then went upstairs, but when shown more rooms, he got angry. The user claims they told the cleaner only to focus on the downstairs and do as much of the upstairs as time allows.\n\nHmm. The main issue is whether the user misrepresented the house size. By not listing all the rooms, the app likely offered a lower price based on fewer rooms. The user might have known or should have known that the service's pricing is tied to the number of rooms. So, when they listed fewer rooms, they effectively paid for a smaller job, but the actual house has more rooms. The cleaner probably expected to clean the number of rooms listed, which is why he got upset when presented with more.\n\nThe user argues that they emphasized the importance of the downstairs and told the cleaner to do the upstairs only if there was time. But the contract is based on the information provided. If the app's system is designed to calculate hours based on the number of rooms, then the user's omission might be considered a breach of the implicit agreement. The cleaner might feel they were misled because the job they were paid for included only certain rooms, and the actual house had more than listed.\n\nThe user's intent was to save money by only using the cleaner for the downstairs, but if the service's terms require accurate information, then the user is at fault. Also, the cleaner's reaction suggests he was expecting to clean all the listed rooms, not knowing there were more. So the user's misrepresentation led to an unfair situation where the cleaner was underpaid for the actual work he did on the upstairs.\n\nBut wait, the user did mention that the cleaner should focus on the downstairs and do the upstairs only if there was time. However, the cleaner might have thought he was being paid to clean all the listed rooms, which were fewer than the actual rooms. So the user's misrepresentation in the initial setup is key here. Even if they gave instructions on the day, the contract terms might rely on the number of rooms listed to determine the price. The user's actions could be seen as deceptive because they didn't provide accurate information, leading to a situation where the cleaner was undercompensated for the extra work he did.\n\nTherefore, the user is likely in the wrong because they misrepresented the house's size to get a lower price, and the cleaner was misled about the scope of the job. Even though they gave instructions on the day, the initial misrepresentation is the root of the problem.\n"
