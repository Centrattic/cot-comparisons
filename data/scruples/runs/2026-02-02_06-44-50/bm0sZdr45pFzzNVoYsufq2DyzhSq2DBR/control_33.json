They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app where the number of hours is determined by the number of rooms listed. They lied about the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to get a 4-hour charge instead of what the app would calculate with the actual numbers. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then went to the upstairs, but got angry because there were more rooms than listed.\n\nFirst, the key issue is whether the user gave false information to secure a lower price. The app's system is based on the size of the house, so if the user didn't accurately report the rooms, they're essentially misrepresenting the job's scope. The cleaner might have expected to clean the entire house as listed, but the user only wanted part of it. However, the user clarified the cleaner's task when he arrived, stating that upstairs wasn't necessary unless he had time. But the cleaner might have expected that all the listed rooms would be cleaned within the 4 hours. The user's misrepresentation could have led to the cleaner's confusion and anger, even if the user tried to adjust expectations later. \n\nThe user's intention was to save money by underreporting rooms, but that's not honest. The cleaner followed the app's instructions based on the info given, so when he found out there were more rooms, he felt misled. Even if the cleaner had time left, the user's initial misstatement is the root of the problem. The user's defense is that they can pay as per the time slot, but the app's pricing model relies on accurate input. So the user is in the wrong for providing false information, leading to the cleaner's frustration. The answer should be A.\n"
