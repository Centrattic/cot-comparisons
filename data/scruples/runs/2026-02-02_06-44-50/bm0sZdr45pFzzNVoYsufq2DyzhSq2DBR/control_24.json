They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app, but they lied about the number of rooms to get a specific number of hours. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then got upset about the upstairs not being listed. The user says they only needed the downstairs cleaned and told the cleaner he didn't have to finish everything.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the user was in the wrong for not listing the full size of the house. The app uses the number of rooms to determine the hours, so by underreporting, the user might have misled the cleaner. But the user's intention was to only have the cleaner work on the downstairs, which was the main priority. They even informed the cleaner about this when he arrived. The cleaner got angry and felt it was a breach of the agreement.\n\nOn one hand, the user didn't provide accurate information about the house size, which the app's system relies on. This could be seen as deceptive because the app's pricing model is based on room count. The cleaner might have expected to clean all listed rooms within the scheduled hours, so the user didn't fully disclose the house's actual size, leading to a misunderstanding.\n\nOn the other hand, the user clearly communicated their priorities to the cleaner upon arrival. They emphasized that the downstairs was the main focus and that the cleaner wasn't obligated to finish the upstairs. The cleaner's anger might stem from feeling that the initial listing was incomplete, but the user did clarify their needs in person. Since the cleaner was still paid for the time he spent and the user followed up with instructions, there's an argument that the user made a reasonable effort to set expectations.\n\nHowever, the key point is whether the initial listing was truthful. The app likely designed the system so that the number of rooms corresponds to the time needed. By lying about the room count, the user might have created an imbalance where the cleaner's time was insufficient for the actual house size. Even if the user clarified later, the initial deception could be seen as the root of the problem.\n\nIn many service scenarios, accurate information is crucial for proper service delivery. If the user provided false data, leading to an underestimation of required time, that could be considered dishonest. The cleaner might have been contracted based on the assumption that the listed rooms would be the only ones cleaned, and the user's manipulation of the system could be viewed as misleading.\n\nTherefore, while the user tried to manage the cleaner's expectations, the initial act of providing incorrect information to the app is ethically questionable. The cleaner's reaction might be justified if the service agreement was based on the app's generated hours from the user's inputs. The user's action could be seen as exploiting a system designed to estimate time based on room count, leading to an unfair situation where the cleaner might feel entitled to more payment for the actual work he could have done if the house were as listed.\n\nIn conclusion, the user's decision to lie about the house size to manipulate the app's scheduling system is where the wrongdoing lies. Even though they communicated their needs to the cleaner, the initial deception affects the fairness of the service agreement. So, the answer would be A.\n"
