They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is they hired a cleaner through an app, and they lied about the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to get a specific hour rate. The app's system uses the number of rooms to determine how many hours the cleaner is booked for. The author wanted the cleaner to focus only on the downstairs, which is why they underreported the rooms. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, but when shown the actual size, he got angry because it didn't match what was listed. The author argues that they told the cleaner he only needed to do as much as he could in the time, but the cleaner felt misled.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about honesty in the hiring process. When you use an app that asks for specific details to calculate the service, lying about those details might be considered deceptive. The app's pricing model is based on the assumption that the number of rooms corresponds to the time needed. If the user provides false information, they're essentially manipulating the system to get a cheaper rate than what the actual work requires. \n\nEven though the author's intention was to only have the cleaner work on the downstairs, the contract or service agreement (implicit when using the app) might expect the cleaner to work on all the listed rooms. By not listing the correct number of rooms, the author didn't give the cleaner a chance to agree to the actual scope of work. The cleaner might have priced the job based on the number of rooms listed, expecting that he'd be cleaning all of them within the given time. \n\nBut then, the author did inform the cleaner upon arrival that the focus was on the downstairs and that the upstairs could be done if time allowed. However, if the app's system is designed to allocate a certain number of hours based on the rooms listed, reducing the number of rooms to get a shorter time might mean the cleaner isn't paid for the full time he would have needed if the correct number of rooms were listed. The cleaner might feel that he was underpaid for the work he did, especially since he had to clean more than expected but wasn't compensated for the extra time.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have known the app's exact terms. Maybe the app doesn't explicitly state that the cleaner must clean all listed rooms. If the app's terms don't specify that the cleaner is obligated to clean all rooms, then the author's approach might be seen as acceptable. However, since the app uses the room count to determine the time, it's reasonable to expect that the cleaner is hired for a job that matches the listed rooms.\n\nThe cleaner's anger could stem from feeling that the job was misrepresented. Even if the author told him to focus on the downstairs, the initial listing was inaccurate, which might have led the cleaner to expect a certain workload for the hours paid. The author might be in the wrong for not being truthful about the house's size when making the booking, which could be considered a breach of the service agreement. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
