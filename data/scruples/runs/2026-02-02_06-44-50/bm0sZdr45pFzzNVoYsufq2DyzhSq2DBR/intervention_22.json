They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not listing the full size of the house when hiring a cleaner. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author used an app where you input the number of rooms to determine the cleaning time. They lied about the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to get a 4-hour window instead of a longer one because they only wanted the cleaner to focus on the downstairs. The cleaner finished quickly, went upstairs, and got angry because the actual number of rooms was higher than listed.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they only needed the downstairs cleaned thoroughly and the cleaner could do as much of the upstairs as possible. The cleaner, however, felt misled because the app's system is based on the number of rooms. The author is now wondering if they were wrong to not list the full size.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author misrepresent the house size? The app's system relies on accurate inputs to determine the scope. By providing false info, the author set up an expectation that the cleaner might not meet if they only did part of the house. The cleaner might have agreed to the job based on the time calculated by the app's algorithm, expecting to clean all listed rooms. When the author changed the plan on-site, the cleaner felt wronged.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue they communicated clearly upon arrival that the priority was downstairs. But the initial misrepresentation might have led to a breach of trust. The cleaner's job might be based on the app's terms, which require accurate room counts. Even if the author explained their priorities, the cleaner might be contractually obligated to clean all listed rooms within the given time. If the author didn't list them, the cleaner might feel they were cheated out of their expected work.\n\nAlso, the cleaner's reaction seems to be about the dishonesty, not just the change of plan. The author didn't inform the cleaner upfront that there were more rooms than listed, which could be seen as deceptive. Even if the cleaner was told after arrival, the initial false information might have led the cleaner to accept the job under different terms. \n\nIn terms of ethics, honesty in transactions is usually expected. The author manipulated the system to get a cheaper or shorter service, which might be seen as unethical. The cleaner's time and effort were based on the app's calculation, which the author altered. Even if the cleaner finished early, the discrepancy in the number of rooms could mean the cleaner wasn't adequately compensated for the actual work (if they were paid based on the app's rate for a 4-hour job but ended up doing more work than expected).\n\nSo, considering all that, the author did misrepresent the house size, leading to a contract that wasn't honored. The cleaner's anger stems from feeling deceived. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
