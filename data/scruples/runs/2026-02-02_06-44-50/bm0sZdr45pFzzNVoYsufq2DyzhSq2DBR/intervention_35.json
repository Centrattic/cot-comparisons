They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they hired a cleaner through an app, and they lied about the size of their house to get a 4-hour cleaning service. The app uses the number of rooms to determine the hours. The author didn't list all the actual rooms because they didn't want the cleaner to work on the upstairs. The cleaner ended up finishing the downstairs quickly and then got angry when the author showed him the extra rooms upstairs, even though the author told him not to worry about the upstairs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations set by the app. If the app's system is based on the user inputting accurate details to determine the service duration, then the author intentionally provided false information. That could be a problem because the app's terms might require truthful information. The cleaner might have been hired under the assumption that they were paid for a specific amount of work based on the listed rooms. If the author didn't include all the rooms, the cleaner might feel cheated because they were paid for a job that was supposed to cover those rooms, but the actual work took less time because the author didn't mention all the rooms.\n\nOn the other hand, the author clearly explained from the start that the downstairs was the priority and the upstairs wasn't necessary. The cleaner might have been under the impression that the time quoted by the app (based on the rooms listed) would cover the work, but since the author didn't list all rooms, the cleaner's time was not fully utilized. The cleaner's anger might stem from feeling that the job wasn't honest or that there was an expectation to clean more than what was paid for.\n\nAnother angle is the responsibility of the app. If the app's system is designed to calculate hours based on the number of rooms, the user's manipulation of that system to get a cheaper rate could be seen as unethical. The cleaner's time was paid for according to the app's calculation, and if the actual work was less than expected due to the user's deception, the cleaner's pay might be unfairly low compared to the actual time they provided.\n\nHowever, the author did inform the cleaner upon arrival that the upstairs wasn't a priority. The cleaner might have been expecting the work listed (based on the app's calculation) but found that the house was smaller, leading to a sense of being misled. The author's deception could lead to a situation where the cleaner feels undercompensated because they were paid for a certain amount of work but actually did less, or maybe the app's pricing isn't directly tied to the actual time spent.\n\nIt's also possible that the app's pricing isn't strictly tied to the number of rooms but to an estimated time based on those rooms. If the author provided inaccurate info, the app's estimate was wrong, and the cleaner might have been paid for a longer service than needed. But the cleaner might have an expectation that the listed rooms are the ones they need to clean, and if you don't list all rooms, you're not being honest.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the app's terms require accurate information and the user provided false data, the user is at fault. The cleaner's job is to clean the listed rooms, and if the user didn't list all rooms, the cleaner might feel that the user is being dishonest. Even if the user told the cleaner to focus on the downstairs, the initial terms of the service might have been based on the listed rooms, so the user's deception could be the issue.\n\nAlternatively, if the app's system is just a guideline and the user can adjust the hours, but in this case, the user manipulated the system by lying about the rooms to get a shorter time, that's the problem. The cleaner might have expected to clean the listed rooms, which were fewer, but the user didn't list all rooms, leading to the cleaner finishing early and then being upset when confronted with more rooms.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author did provide false information to the app to get a cheaper or shorter service, which led to the cleaner finishing quickly but being upset when the actual house size (with more rooms) was revealed. The cleaner might have felt that the user didn't honor the terms of the service by not listing all rooms, leading to a conflict. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for misleading the cleaner and the app's system.\n"
