They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they hired a cleaner through an app. The app requires inputting the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to determine the cleaning time. The author didn't list all the actual rooms because they didn't want the cleaner to focus on the upstairs areas. They wanted the cleaner to concentrate on the downstairs, which was more important. The cleaner finished quickly and then got angry when they showed him the upstairs, saying it wasn't what was listed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. The app probably uses the room count to calculate the job's scope and duration. If the user provided inaccurate information, that could be an issue. The cleaner might have expected to clean the listed number of rooms, and the author didn't mention that some areas weren't to be cleaned. Even if the author told the cleaner in person to focus on the downstairs, the initial listing was misleading. The cleaner might feel they were misled because the app's pricing and time were based on the incorrect room count. \n\nAlso, the contract or agreement here is between the user and the app, but the cleaner likely followed the listing details. The author's instructions in person might not override the initial terms set through the app. The cleaner could have a right to be upset because the job's parameters were misrepresented. Even if the author thought they could adjust the scope, the cleaner's agreement was based on the provided data. \n\nMoreover, the author mentioned that the parents are strict about cleanliness, so maybe there's an expectation of thorough cleaning. However, the cleaner might have been under the impression that all listed rooms would be cleaned within the given time. The author's approach could be seen as manipulating the system to get a lower price while still expecting the cleaner to handle the entire house if time permits. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did try to communicate the main priority to the cleaner. But if the app's terms require accurate room listings, then the author is at fault for providing false information. The cleaner's anger stems from the discrepancy between the listed rooms and the actual ones. So, even if the author tried to clarify in person, the initial data was misleading. The cleaner's job might have been priced based on the incorrect room count, which is unfair to them. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for not being honest about the house's size when booking the service.\n"
