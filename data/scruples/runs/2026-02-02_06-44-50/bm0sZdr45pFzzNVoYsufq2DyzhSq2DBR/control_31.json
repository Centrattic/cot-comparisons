They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is they hired a cleaner through an app, but they lied about the size of the house to get a 4-hour service instead of a longer time. The cleaner ended up finishing the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, but when they saw more bedrooms and bathrooms than listed, they got angry.\n\nHmm, the user says they only wanted the cleaner to focus on the downstairs, and the app's system required listing rooms to determine hours. By not listing all the rooms, they got a shorter service time. The cleaner was upset because they thought they were supposed to clean everything listed, but the user only listed part of the house. \n\nSo, the key points here are about honesty and the terms of the service. The app probably uses the number of rooms to calculate the required time, which implies that the cleaner is expected to clean all the rooms listed. If the user didn't list all the rooms, they might have misled the cleaner into thinking they had a certain amount of work for that price. The cleaner, expecting to clean the listed rooms, finished quickly but found more rooms than they were paid to handle. \n\nThe user argues that they told the cleaner to focus on the downstairs and only do what's possible with the remaining time. However, the cleaner felt wronged because the job parameters were misrepresented. The user's action of lying about the house size to get a lower price might be considered deceptive. Even if the user's intention was to save money, the cleaner was hired under the impression of a certain workload, which wasn't fully met. \n\nI think the user is in the wrong because they misrepresented the job details, leading to a misunderstanding. The cleaner's frustration is valid since they were promised a certain scope of work based on the listing. The user's actions could be seen as taking advantage of the system, which isn't fair to the cleaner. So the answer should be A.\n"
