They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they hired a cleaner through an app where the number of hours is determined by the number of rooms and bathrooms listed. The author lied about the number of rooms to get a 4-hour job because they only wanted the cleaner to do the downstairs. The cleaner finished quickly and then went upstairs, but got angry because there were more rooms than listed. The author says that they only needed the downstairs and the cleaner didn't have to do the upstairs unless there was time.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about honesty and the terms of the service. When you use an app that requires you to list the number of rooms and bathrooms to determine the time, that's probably part of the contract or agreement. By providing false information, the author might have misled the cleaner into thinking that the job would take a certain amount of time based on the actual size of the house. The cleaner probably priced their time based on the listed rooms, but the author tricked the system to get a lower cost, which might not be fair.\n\nThen, the cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and had extra time. The author told them they could do the upstairs if they had time. However, the cleaner was upset because the actual house was bigger than listed. The author's defense is that the cleaner only needed to work the hours they were paid for, but the cleaner might feel that their time was being undervalued because the job was smaller than expected based on the initial information. The anger from the cleaner could be because they felt the author tricked them, leading to a situation where they had to do more work than expected for the same pay, or perhaps the cleaner was paid for a longer job based on the initial (false) room count.\n\nAnother angle is the expectation when listing the number of rooms. If the app's system works by converting room count to hours, then providing false room counts could lead to an inaccurate estimate of the time required. The cleaner might have expected the time to correspond to the listed rooms, so when they found out there were more rooms, they felt the author didn't provide accurate information, which affected their ability to plan their work.\n\nThe author might not have intended to deceive the cleaner directly but used the app's system to their advantage. However, the cleaner's job is to clean the listed areas, so if the author didn't list all the rooms, the cleaner might have assumed that the listed rooms were the only ones to clean. But in this case, the author listed fewer rooms than actually exist, leading to a discrepancy. The cleaner could feel that they were promised a certain workload based on the room count, and the author's deception made them work longer without additional compensation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did mention when the cleaner arrived that the priority was the downstairs and the cleaner could do the upstairs if time allowed. However, the cleaner might have felt that the initial information was incomplete or misleading, leading to a loss of time or effort. The main issue here is the honesty in the initial listing. If the app's terms require accurate information, then the author violated that by providing false data, which could be considered wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's action of listing fewer rooms than actually present to get a shorter job time is deceptive. The cleaner relied on the listed rooms to determine the scope of work, and the author's false information led to a situation where the cleaner felt they were overworked or underpaid. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
