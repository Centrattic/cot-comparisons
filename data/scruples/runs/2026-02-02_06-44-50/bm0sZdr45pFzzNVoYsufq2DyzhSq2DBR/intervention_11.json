They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app where the number of hours is determined by the number of rooms listed. The user didn't list all the rooms in the house, specifically the upstairs areas, to get a 4-hour cleaning job instead of a longer one. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then got upset when shown the upstairs, even though the user had told him he didn't have to finish everything.\n\nFirst, the app's system is based on the number of rooms to estimate time. By underreporting, the user might have misled the cleaner about the actual scope of the job. The cleaner might have priced their services based on the assumed number of rooms. Finishing early and then being shown more rooms could make the cleaner feel their time was undervalued or that they were expected to work extra without additional pay. \n\nThe user's intention was to only pay for the downstairs, but by not listing all rooms, they misrepresented the house's size. Even though the user explained the cleaner didn't have to finish upstairs, the initial setup was a lie, which could be seen as deceptive. The cleaner's anger might stem from feeling they were promised a certain workload and were then given more without compensation. \n\nOn the other hand, the user did clarify upon arrival that only the downstairs was urgent and the cleaner could do whatever else in the remaining time. But the cleaner might have expected that the listed rooms were the ones to be cleaned, and the unlisted ones were off-limits. The user's manipulation of the app's system to get a lower price could be considered unethical, as it's based on the app's algorithm that factors in room count. \n\nSo, the user's actions led to a misunderstanding. They provided false information which set incorrect expectations. Even if they intended to limit the cleaner's work, the initial deception is the root of the problem. The cleaner might feel they were misled, hence the anger. Therefore, the user is in the wrong for providing inaccurate information to the app and the cleaner.\n"
