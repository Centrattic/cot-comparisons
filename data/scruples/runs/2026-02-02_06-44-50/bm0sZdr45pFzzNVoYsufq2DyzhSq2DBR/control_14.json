They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is they hired a cleaner through an app, but they lied about the size of the house to get a 4-hour service instead of the actual time the app would allocate if they listed all the rooms. The cleaner ended up finishing the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, but the author didn't want him to do the upstairs unless there was time left. The cleaner got angry because the house was bigger than listed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. When you use an app like that, there's probably a contract or agreement based on the information you provide. By misrepresenting the number of rooms, the author might have violated the terms. The app probably calculates the hours based on the size to ensure the cleaner has enough time. If the cleaner expected only certain rooms and the author didn't disclose the full size, that's a problem.\n\nAlso, the cleaner's reaction might be because he was paid for a job that included more rooms than he expected. If the app's pricing is based on the number of rooms, the author might have underpaid. The cleaner could feel cheated because the time given wasn't enough for the actual work needed if all rooms were included. Even if the author told the cleaner to focus on downstairs, the initial misrepresentation matters. The cleaner might not have agreed to extra work without compensation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did specify the priority areas and told the cleaner not to feel pressured about the upstairs. But by not listing the full house size, they set up a situation where the cleaner might have felt misled. The app's system is designed to estimate time based on the inputs, so the author's manipulation of that could be seen as deceptive.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they provided false information to get a lower price, which affected the cleaner's expectations and workload. The cleaner's anger is a legitimate reaction to being misled about the scope of the job. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
