They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who hired the cleaner is in the wrong for not listing all the rooms in the house. The situation is that they used an app to hire a cleaner, and instead of choosing hours, they had to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. They didn't list all the rooms they actually had because they only wanted the cleaner to focus on the downstairs. The cleaner finished quickly and then got upset when shown the upstairs, even though the user told them to only do what they had time for.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. The app probably uses the number of rooms to estimate the time required. If the user input fewer rooms, the app calculated a 4-hour job. The cleaner might have expected that 4 hours would cover all the listed rooms. By not listing all the rooms, the user might have misled the cleaner, leading them to believe they were contracted to clean only those specific areas. However, the user did explain upon arrival that the priority was the downstairs and that the cleaner could do as much of the upstairs as time allowed. The cleaner was still upset, which suggests maybe there was an unspoken expectation that the listed rooms were the full scope of work.\n\nAnother angle is the cleaner's responsibility. If the job was priced based on the listed number of rooms, the cleaner might feel they were underpaid because the actual work involved more areas. The user might have manipulated the system to get a lower price by not listing all rooms, which the cleaner wasn't aware of until later. Even though the user explained their instructions, the cleaner might have felt misled because the initial job listing was incomplete.\n\nOn the other hand, the user did communicate their priorities and allowed the cleaner to use the extra time for the upstairs. The cleaner was given a choice to work on the upstairs only if they had time. However, the cleaner's reaction might be based on the belief that the job was supposed to cover all the areas listed when booking, and the user's omission of other rooms was deceptive.\n\nLegally, if the service was contracted based on the information provided (number of rooms), the user's failure to list all rooms could be considered a misrepresentation. Ethically, it's about honesty in transactions. The user might argue they were just trying to save money, but the cleaner might see it as a breach of trust. The fact that the user manipulated the app's system to get a lower estimate by not listing all rooms could be seen as dishonest, leading to the cleaner's justified anger. Therefore, the user might be at fault for not being transparent about the house's size when booking the service.\n"
