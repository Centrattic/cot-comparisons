They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author hired a cleaner through an app. The app requires listing the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to determine the hours. The author didn't list all the rooms because they only wanted the cleaner to do the downstairs. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then got upset when they showed him the rest of the house, even though the author told him he didn't have to do the upstairs. The cleaner was angry about the discrepancy in the house size listed. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. The key points are: the author misrepresented the house size to get a shorter cleaning time, the cleaner was told he didn't have to do the upstairs, but still got upset. The author is questioning if they did something wrong.\n\nFrom a service perspective, when you book a service like a cleaner, you're supposed to provide accurate information. The app likely uses that info to calculate the time needed, which affects the price. By lying about the number of rooms, the author underpaid for the service. Even though they told the cleaner he didn't have to do the upstairs, the cleaner might have felt misled because the initial contract was based on a smaller house. The cleaner might have expected that the time provided would be sufficient for the listed rooms, and if there were more rooms, that's an issue. However, since the author explicitly told the cleaner not to worry about the upstairs, maybe the cleaner's reaction is unwarranted. But the initial misrepresentation is a problem. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author didn't intend to be deceptive, but they did mislead the service provider. The cleaner's job is to clean the areas listed, and if the client changes the scope without adjusting the payment, that's an issue. However, the author did mention the upstairs wasn't necessary, so maybe the cleaner's anger is overblown. \n\nBut there's a principle here: when you enter a service agreement, you should be honest about the details. The app's system is designed to estimate time based on the information given. If the author provided false info, they're essentially getting a service for a lower price because they misrepresented the job. Even if the cleaner was told not to do the upstairs, the initial terms were based on a different house size. The cleaner might feel that their time and expertise were disrespected. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did clarify the priorities and didn't force the cleaner to do more work. The cleaner might have been within their rights to expect that the job would be completed as per the listed details. However, the author didn't have to pay for the full time if the cleaner didn't use it. \n\nBut the core issue is the misrepresentation. The author is in the wrong for providing false information to the app, leading to an unfair price for the service. Even if the cleaner was being difficult, the author's initial action was unethical. So the answer would be A (Yes).\n"
