They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that they hired a cleaner through an app, but lied about the size of the house to get a shorter cleaning time. The cleaner ended up finishing the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, but got angry when he realized the house was bigger than what was listed.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author used an app where you input the number of rooms to determine the hours. They underreported the rooms to get a 4-hour estimate. The cleaner finished the downstairs in 90 minutes and then moved upstairs, but got upset about the extra rooms. The author told the cleaner not to worry about the upstairs, but the cleaner was still angry.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong. The app likely uses the room count to estimate the time needed for the job. By underreporting, the author might have misled the cleaner, expecting him to work beyond the estimated time for the same rate. The cleaner probably expected to clean the listed rooms within the quoted time, but the author provided fewer rooms, leading to extra time. That could be seen as deceptive because the app's pricing model is based on accurate room counts.\n\nAlso, the author mentioned the cleaner's attitude, but maybe the cleaner has a right to be upset because the job took less time than expected, but the author didn't adjust the payment. Alternatively, the app might have a policy that the cleaner must clean the listed rooms within the allocated time. If the author didn't list the actual rooms, they might have broken the terms of the service.\n\nAnother angle: the author's intention was to save money by underreporting, which could be considered dishonest. The cleaner might feel that he was paid for a certain scope of work, which was misrepresented. Even if the author told the cleaner not to worry about the upstairs, the initial misrepresentation could be the root of the problem.\n\nHowever, the app's terms might not be clear. If the app allows for flexibility, maybe the author isn't at fault. But in most service agreements, providing accurate information is crucial. The cleaner might have been expecting a certain workload based on the listed rooms, and the author's deception could be a breach of contract, even if informal.\n\nSo, considering the app's process and the cleaner's perspective, the author likely misrepresented the job's scope, leading to the cleaner's frustration. Therefore, the author is probably in the wrong.\n"
