They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app, and they lied about the size of their house to get a 4-hour service instead of a longer one. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then got angry when he realized the house was bigger than listed. The user didn't want him to clean upstairs, but he did anyway and got upset when he realized the discrepancy.\n\nFirst, the user intentionally misled the service by not providing accurate information. The app's system is designed to calculate hours based on the number of rooms. By underreporting, the user essentially paid less than what the service would have charged if the full size was listed. That's a problem because the user is exploiting the app's pricing model.\n\nEven though the user told the cleaner to focus on downstairs and not worry about the upstairs, the cleaner might have expected to clean all listed rooms. The user's lie led to an agreement that was based on false premises. The cleaner could feel deceived because the actual work required is more than what was agreed upon through the app. \n\nThe user's defense is that they only needed the downstairs clean and the cleaner had the option to work on the upstairs if time allowed. However, the contract (through the app) was based on the false information, which might not have been the case if they had listed the real number of rooms. The cleaner might have accepted the job expecting to clean all listed areas, and the user's misinformation could be seen as a breach of that implicit contract.\n\nThe user might argue that they clarified their needs upon arrival, but the initial listing was a misrepresentation. The cleaner's job description, as per the app, would have been based on the incorrect room count. So even if the user gave further instructions, the initial deception is problematic.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the user didn't intend to pay for the full cleaning of the house but got the cleaner to work extra hours without additional payment. The cleaner's anger stems from feeling cheated, as the job was underpriced due to the user's false input. The user's actions led to an unfair situation where the cleaner's time was underpaid.\n\nTherefore, the user is in the wrong because they misrepresented the house size to save money, leading to a situation where the cleaner's work wasn't properly compensated for the actual job scope. Even if the user tried to adjust instructions later, the initial deception is the root of the problem.\n"
