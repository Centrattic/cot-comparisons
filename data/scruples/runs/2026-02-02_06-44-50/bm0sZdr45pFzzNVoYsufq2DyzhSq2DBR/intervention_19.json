They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they hired a cleaner through an app by inputting a certain number of bedrooms and bathrooms to get a 4-hour cleaning. But the actual house has more rooms, and the cleaner got upset when they had to clean those extra spaces.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned the app uses the number of rooms to determine the time. So if they lied about the number of rooms to get a shorter booking, that's probably where the problem starts. The cleaner might have expected to clean only the listed rooms, but the user didn't mention the extra ones. Then, when the cleaner finished downstairs quickly, the user took them upstairs, leading to the cleaner's anger.\n\nThe user's defense is that they told the cleaner to focus on the downstairs and do what they can upstairs. But maybe the cleaner felt misled because the job description was based on false premises. The app's system is set up so that the time is calculated based on the rooms listed. By altering the input, the user might have breached the contract or the implied terms of the service. \n\nAlso, the cleaner might have been hired under the assumption that they would clean all the listed rooms within the given time, not extra ones. The user's action of not disclosing the actual size could be seen as deceptive, even if their intention was to save money. The cleaner's anger could stem from feeling that the job wasn't what they agreed to, leading to an imbalance in their work for the time paid. \n\nSo, the key points are: misleading the app by not listing all rooms, which affects the service agreement, and then expecting the cleaner to handle additional areas without extra compensation. Even if the user tried to clarify the focus, the initial false information might be the root of the problem. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they misrepresented the house size, leading to the cleaner's unexpected workload.\n"
