They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app where you input the number of rooms and bathrooms, and the app determines the hours. The user didn't list all the rooms because they only wanted the cleaner to do the downstairs. The cleaner finished quickly and then went upstairs, but got angry when there were more rooms than listed.\n\nSo, the key points here are about honesty and expectations. The user intentionally underreported the number of rooms to get a shorter, cheaper cleaning time. The cleaner probably expected to clean all the rooms listed and might have assumed that the time was enough for that. The user told the cleaner to focus on the downstairs and do as much of the upstairs as possible, but the cleaner was upset because the actual number of rooms was higher than what was listed.\n\nFrom the app's perspective, if the pricing and time are based on the number of rooms, then the user isn't following the system correctly. The cleaner might have been contracted to clean the listed rooms for the given hours, but the user changed the scope by not listing all rooms. The cleaner's job might involve cleaning the listed rooms, and the user's deception led to an unexpected workload. Even though the user tried to clarify the priorities, the initial misrepresentation is problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the user's intention was to only have the cleaner focus on the downstairs, but the app's system doesn't allow for specifying priority areas just the number of rooms. The user might have misunderstood how the app works. However, the user had the opportunity to clarify with the cleaner upon arrival but still didn't correct the room count, which could be seen as misleading.\n\nSo, the user's actions led to a conflict. They misrepresented the house size to get a lower price, which the cleaner found out and felt wronged. Even if the user's intention was\u5584\u610f, the act of lying about the house's size is ethically questionable. The cleaner's job might be based on the information provided, and the user's deception could be considered a breach of trust. Therefore, the user is in the wrong.\n"
