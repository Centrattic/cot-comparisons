They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about hiring a cleaner through an app where you list the number of rooms, and the app determines the hours. The person lied about the number of rooms to get a 4-hour cleaning, but the cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then got angry when they showed him the upstairs rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The user didn't list all the rooms because they only wanted the cleaner to focus on the downstairs. The app uses room count to determine hours, so by underreporting, they got a cheaper rate but ended up with extra time. The cleaner was paid for 4 hours, and after finishing the downstairs quickly, the user showed the upstairs, leading to the cleaner's frustration.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The user misrepresented the house size to get a lower price, which the cleaner might have expected to clean all listed areas within the given time. The cleaner probably calculated his work based on the provided information, expecting that the 4 hours would cover the listed rooms. By adding more rooms without adjusting the hours, the user created an expectation that the cleaner might not be able to fulfill, leading to his anger.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, the cleaner's anger stems from feeling that the user tricked him into not getting paid enough for the actual work. The user didn't inform the cleaner upfront that there were more rooms but didn't want to include them in the initial listing. The cleaner might have assumed that the listed rooms were all there were, and the user's deception led to his dissatisfaction.\n\nHowever, the user did clarify upon the cleaner's arrival that the downstairs was the priority and the upstairs was optional. But the cleaner might have felt that the time he was paid for wasn't enough to cover all the actual rooms. The user didn't adjust the hours based on the true size of the house, so the cleaner might feel shortchanged.\n\nOn the other hand, the user didn't force the cleaner to do the upstairs and allowed him to leave after the time was up. The cleaner was paid for the 4 hours, and the user didn't have to pay extra. But the cleaner's time was used to clean fewer rooms than he expected, leading to extra work without compensation.\n\nEthically, the user might be in the wrong because they misrepresented the house size to get a lower price, which affected the cleaner's expectations. The user's actions could be seen as deceptive, even if they tried to compensate by allowing the cleaner to focus on the downstairs. The cleaner's anger is justified if he felt he was paid for a job that included all listed rooms, and the user added unlisted rooms, making the job more than he anticipated.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the user explaining the priority upon arrival. However, the initial listing was false, which set the expectation for the cleaner. The user's responsibility was to list the house accurately. By not doing so, they created a situation where the cleaner's time might be insufficient for the actual work, leading to his frustration.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user might not have intended to deceive the cleaner beyond the initial listing, the act of falsifying the house size to get a lower price is a form of deception. Therefore, the user is in the wrong.\n"
