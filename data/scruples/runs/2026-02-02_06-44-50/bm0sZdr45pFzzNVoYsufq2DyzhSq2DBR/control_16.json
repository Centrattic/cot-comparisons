They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about hiring a cleaner through an app where you input the number of rooms to determine the hours. The author lied about the size of the house to keep the cleaning time shorter, so the cleaner only had to do the downstairs. But the cleaner ended up finishing quickly, then went upstairs and got angry when he saw there were more rooms than listed.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the main points. The app's system is based on the number of rooms to calculate hours. The author intentionally provided false information to get a lower hour estimate. The cleaner was supposed to do only the downstairs, but since he finished early, there was time left. The author told him he could do the upstairs if he had time, but the cleaner was upset about the discrepancy in room count.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, when using such services, the terms are usually that the customer provides accurate information for the service quote. If the app's terms require truthful input, then the author violated that by lying. The cleaner might have agreed to the job based on the listed rooms, and now there's a mismatch. The author didn't inform the cleaner upfront about the actual house size, leading to a possible breach of the service agreement.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did mention to the cleaner that upstairs wasn't a priority and he could do as much as time allowed. However, the cleaner's anger stems from the initial false information, which the author withheld. Even if the cleaner had time, the terms of the service might have been based on the false data. The cleaner could argue that the service wasn't as contracted because the house was larger than reported.\n\nSo, the key issue is the intentional deception in providing room count to the app. This likely violates the service's terms, leading to an unfair situation for the cleaner. The author's actions led to a misunderstanding and the cleaner feeling misled, even though the author tried to clarify upon arrival. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for providing false information to the app, which affected the service agreement.\n"
