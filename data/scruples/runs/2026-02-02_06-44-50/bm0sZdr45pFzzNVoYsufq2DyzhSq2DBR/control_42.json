They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app where they input the number of rooms to get an hour estimate. They lied about the number of rooms to get a 4-hour booking, intending for the cleaner to focus only on the downstairs. The cleaner finished quickly and then went upstairs, but when shown more rooms, he got angry.\n\nFirst, the app's system probably calculates hours based on the number of rooms listed. By providing incorrect info, the user might have misled the app's algorithm. The cleaner was assigned based on the 4-hour estimate, which might be based on the rooms given. So the user didn't follow the app's process correctly, which could be a problem. \n\nThe user tried to communicate that only the downstairs was important and the cleaner could do as much as time allowed. However, the cleaner expected to clean all listed rooms within the time. If the app's terms state that the cleaner will cover all listed rooms, then the user didn't fulfill that part. The cleaner's anger might stem from feeling the job wasn't fully done as per the agreement. \n\nAlso, the user didn't mention the actual number of rooms, which the app uses to determine the job scope. Even if the user explained upon arrival, the initial setup was misleading. The cleaner might have relied on the listed info to plan the job, so the user's deception could be problematic. \n\nBut the user also mentioned that the important area was downstairs and the cleaner could prioritize. The issue is whether the app's process requires accurate room counts for proper compensation. If the user underpaid by not listing all rooms, that's an issue. The cleaner might feel underpaid because the job was less than expected, but the user paid for the time based on the correct info. \n\nAlternatively, if the app's pricing is based on room count, and the user listed fewer rooms to get a cheaper rate, the cleaner might not have been paid enough for the actual work. But the user paid for the hours they hired, which the cleaner might have finished early. \n\nLegally or ethically, the user might be in the wrong for misrepresenting the house size to get a lower price, which could affect the cleaner's earnings. But the user's intent was to focus on the downstairs, which they communicated. The cleaner's job was to clean the listed rooms, but the user didn't list all, leading to a mismatch. \n\nThe user's responsibility was to follow the app's process correctly. By not doing so, they might have created an unfair situation for the cleaner. The cleaner's anger is about being misled about the job's scope. So the user is in the wrong for not being honest about the house's size when using the app's system.\n"
