They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by not listing the full size of the house when hiring a cleaner. The situation is that they used an app where you input the number of rooms to determine the hours. They lied about the number to get a 4-hour job but ended up with a cleaner who was upset because there were more rooms upstairs.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author intentionally provided false information about the house size to get a cheaper or shorter service. The app's system is based on the number of rooms to calculate hours, so when they listed fewer rooms, the app allocated fewer hours. The cleaner completed the downstairs faster than expected and then was expected to clean the upstairs without extra time or payment. However, the cleaner was angry because the actual number of rooms was different from what was listed.\n\nNow, considering the app's terms. If the app uses the number of rooms to determine the service duration, then the user is responsible for providing accurate information. By lying, they might have violated the app's terms of service. The cleaner's payment was based on the listed rooms and hours, so if the user didn't disclose the actual size upfront, the cleaner is within their rights to be upset. The user tried to change the scope of work after the fact, expecting the cleaner to use the remaining time for additional areas not listed. But since the contract (implicit or explicit) was based on the listed rooms, the user might be in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the cleaner's anger could be because they felt misled. They might have expected to be paid for cleaning all the rooms listed, and the user's deception made them feel like they were doing extra work for the same rate. Even though the user tried to explain they didn't need the upstairs cleaned, the initial misrepresentation is the issue here. The cleaner's job was to clean the listed areas, and the user's failure to disclose all rooms upfront could be considered unethical or dishonest.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the app allows for flexibility. If the user communicated clearly upon arrival that the priority was the downstairs and the cleaner could do upstairs as time permits, perhaps the cleaner should have been aware of that. But the main problem is the initial misrepresentation. The user didn't list all rooms, leading to a mismatch in expectations. The cleaner was expecting to clean all listed rooms, but the user had more rooms than they listed. So the user is in the wrong for not being transparent from the start.\n\nIn conclusion, the author likely misrepresented the house size, leading to the cleaner's dissatisfaction. The app's system relies on accurate input to determine service hours, so providing false info was the mistake. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
