They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about hiring a cleaner through an app where the number of hours is determined by the number of rooms listed. The author lied about the number of rooms to get a 4-hour service, intending to only clean the downstairs. The cleaner did the downstairs quickly and then got upset when there were more rooms upstairs than listed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the contract or agreement between the author and the cleaner. The app's system uses the number of rooms to calculate the hours. If the author provided incorrect information, leading the cleaner to expect a certain workload, then the cleaner might feel misled. Even if the author explained the focus on the downstairs, the cleaner might have expected to clean the listed number of rooms based on the booking. \n\nThe cleaner's job description could be based on the rooms listed. If the app requires specific room counts to determine the service time, then the author's misrepresentation could be seen as deceptive. The cleaner might believe that the service time is based on the actual number of rooms, so underreporting could lead to underpaying them in terms of time. \n\nAlso, the cleaner's reaction suggests that they felt the contract was breached. The author might have thought they were saving money by not listing all rooms, but the cleaner likely expects to work for the time they're paid. The author's explanation that the cleaner only needed to work for the booked time might not align with the cleaner's understanding of the job, which could be based on the room count provided. \n\nHowever, the author did mention that the cleaner should only do as much as possible within the time, not all the rooms. But if the contract (as per the app's system) implies a certain number of rooms, then the author's misrepresentation could be problematic. The cleaner might feel that the job should be done according to the listed parameters, hence the anger when there were more rooms. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author might have intended to get a fair service for the money, but by misrepresenting the house size, they could be exploiting a loophole in the system. The cleaner might have expected to work for the time allocated based on the correct room count, leading to a fair exchange of money for service. \n\nSo, the author's actions might be considered dishonest because they provided false information to get a cheaper service, even if they intended to use the extra time for other purposes. The cleaner's job is to clean the listed rooms in the booked time, and the author's underreporting led to an unfair situation where the cleaner might not be compensated adequately for the actual work required. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
