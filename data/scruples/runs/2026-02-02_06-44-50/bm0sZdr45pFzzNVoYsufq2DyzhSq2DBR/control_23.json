They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking about a situation where they hired a cleaner through an app. The app requires inputting the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to determine the hours, but the author didn't list all of them because they only wanted the cleaner to focus on the downstairs. The cleaner got angry because there were more rooms than listed, even though the author told him he didn't have to finish everything upstairs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service from the app. If the app's pricing and time allocation is based on the number of rooms, then the author might have misrepresented the house size. By not listing all the rooms, they effectively underpaid for the service, expecting the cleaner to work for a shorter time. However, the cleaner arrived early and was willing to use the remaining time to help with the upstairs, which the author had previously agreed to.\n\nThe cleaner's anger could stem from feeling misled. If the app calculates hours based on the number of rooms, the author's lie might have created a situation where the cleaner's rate was lower than it should have been. The cleaner might have expected to work the full time based on the listed rooms, but since the author didn't list all, the cleaner was overqualified or overworked for the time paid. However, the author did clarify upon arrival that the upstairs wasn't necessary unless the cleaner had time. The cleaner still chose to do part of the upstairs but then got upset when there were more rooms than expected.\n\nI should also think about the communication. The author did explain the situation when the cleaner arrived, so maybe the cleaner expected to be informed from the start. If the app requires accurate information, the author's deception could be an issue. On the other hand, the cleaner might have assumed that the app's calculation was accurate and expected to be paid for the actual work required.\n\nAnother angle: the app's policy. If the app explicitly states that the hours are based on the number of rooms provided, then the author violated that by not listing all rooms. But the app might not hold the customer responsible if they changed the information, so the cleaner might not have a case against the app. The cleaner's contract probably is with the app, not the user directly, so the user's responsibility is to follow the app's guidelines when booking.\n\nThe user also mentions that the cleaner was angry about the attitude. If the user was polite and clear from the start, maybe the cleaner's reaction is unprofessional. But the user's initial deception (not listing all rooms) might have set up a situation where the cleaner felt wronged. Even if the user tried to clarify later, the initial misrepresentation could be the root of the problem.\n\nSo, the key points are: the user lied about the house size to get a lower quote, the cleaner was given the correct instructions upon arrival, but the cleaner got upset after realizing the house was bigger. The user didn't cancel the service, which is good, but the initial misrepresentation is an issue. The app's terms likely require accurate information to determine the service time and cost. Therefore, the user is in the wrong for not being truthful about the house size, which could affect the cleaner's pay (if the app charges based on that). Even though the user tried to adjust expectations later, the initial act of deception is problematic.\n"
