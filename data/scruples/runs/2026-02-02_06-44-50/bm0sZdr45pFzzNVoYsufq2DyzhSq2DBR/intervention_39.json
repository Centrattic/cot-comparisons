They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is they hired a cleaner through an app. The app requires inputting the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to determine the hours. The author lied about the number to get a 4-hour service because they only wanted the cleaner to focus on the downstairs. The cleaner ended up finishing the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, but when they saw there were more rooms than listed, they got angry. The author tried to explain that the cleaner only needed to do as much as possible within the 4 hours, but the cleaner was upset anyway.\n\nFirst, the author didn't list the actual number of rooms. That's a key point. When using an app, the terms are usually based on the info you provide. If the app calculates the hours based on the number of rooms, then providing false info would mean the service isn't as agreed. The cleaner probably assumes that the listed rooms are the ones covered in the package. The author might have expected the cleaner to only do the downstairs, but the cleaner might have a contract that requires covering all listed rooms within the given time. So, the author's deception could lead to a breach of the service agreement. The cleaner's job might be to clean all listed areas within the time, so if the author didn't list all rooms, that's a problem. The cleaner's reaction could be about the author's dishonesty, not just about the work itself. Even if the author told the cleaner to focus on downstairs, the initial contract might have obligations based on the listed rooms. So, the author's lie affected the terms of the service. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for misleading the cleaner about the house size to get a cheaper or shorter service, which the cleaner might not be obligated to handle beyond the agreed terms.\n"
