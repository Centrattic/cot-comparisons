They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nSo, the author hired a cleaner through an app. The app requires inputting the number of rooms to determine the hours. The author didn't list the actual number of bedrooms and bathrooms because they wanted the cleaner to only clean the downstairs. The cleaner arrived, finished the downstairs quickly, then went upstairs and got angry because there were more rooms than listed. The author told the cleaner upfront that the priority was downstairs and the cleaner could do what they had time for upstairs. The cleaner was upset and the author is wondering if they did something wrong.\n\nFirst, looking at the contract or agreement. When using the app, the user inputs the number of rooms, which the app uses to calculate the hours. By providing false information about the house size, the author is essentially misrepresenting the scope of work. The cleaner's expectation was based on the information given, which was that the house was smaller. If the app's pricing is based on that info, then the author didn't pay for a full clean of the entire house. The cleaner might feel misled because they were promised a certain amount of work based on the listed rooms. \n\nThe author then expects the cleaner to work on the upstairs areas without additional compensation, even though they had more rooms than what was paid for. From a fairness standpoint, the cleaner might argue that the job was supposed to cover all listed rooms, and the author's underreporting led to a lower quote. If the cleaner finishes the downstairs quickly, that's their efficiency, but the author might have agreed to a limited scope. The key issue here is whether the author misrepresented the house's size to get a lower price, thereby not accounting for all rooms the cleaner would have expected to clean.\n\nHowever, the author did communicate the priority areas and that the cleaner could do as much as they had time for. But the problem is that the initial terms of the job (as set by the app) were based on false premises. If the app's terms state that the number of rooms dictates the hours and scope, the author is in the wrong for lying about the house size. The cleaner's anger might stem from not being paid for the full job they were led to believe, even if the author said they could work on the upstairs. The cleaner might feel that the job was supposed to cover all the rooms they listed, and the author's deception affected that.\n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the app's terms require accurate input for the job's scope. If the user is required to list the actual rooms, and they lied to get a lower price, then they're in the wrong. The cleaner's job was based on the information provided, and the author's false input altered the agreement. Even if the author tried to adjust expectations on the spot, the initial dishonesty sets up a problem. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong (A).\n"
