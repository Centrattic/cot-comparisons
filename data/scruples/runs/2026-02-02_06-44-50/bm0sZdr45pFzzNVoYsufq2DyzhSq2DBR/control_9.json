They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is they hired a cleaner through an app, and they lied about the size of their house to get a 4-hour service. The app uses the number of rooms to determine how long the cleaner works. The cleaner finished the downstairs in 90 minutes and then got upset when there were more rooms upstairs than listed.\n\nFirst, the author didn't tell the cleaner the full size of the house. They manipulated the app's input to get a shorter, cheaper cleaning time. But the cleaner ended up with extra time and then had to deal with more rooms than expected, which made him angry. The author argues that the cleaner only needed to use the time they paid for and focus on the downstairs, but the cleaner felt misled about the house's size.\n\nNow, considering the terms of the service. If the app's system is designed to calculate the time based on the number of rooms, then by underreporting, the author might have violated the app's terms. The cleaner probably expected to clean the listed number of rooms within the allocated time. If the actual house has more rooms, the cleaner might feel they were given an incomplete or inaccurate job description. \n\nAlso, the author didn't mention the extra rooms when the cleaner arrived. The cleaner was told to focus on the downstairs, but the initial listing was misleading. Even if the author explained that the upstairs wasn't critical, the cleaner might still feel that the contract was based on false premises. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to get the downstairs cleaned thoroughly, which the cleaner did quickly. They might argue that the cleaner was still within the time frame and could have chosen to leave after the upstairs was done, but maybe there's an expectation that the cleaner works the full time paid for. However, the key issue is the misrepresentation of the house's size. \n\nIf the app's terms state that the number of rooms directly affects the cleaning time, then the author's action could be considered deceptive. The cleaner's anger might stem from feeling that the job was advertised with false information, leading to an unexpected workload. \n\nSo, even though the author's intention was to focus on the downstairs, the method they used by lying about the house size could be seen as dishonest. The cleaner might have a valid point about being misled, which could make the author at fault. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
