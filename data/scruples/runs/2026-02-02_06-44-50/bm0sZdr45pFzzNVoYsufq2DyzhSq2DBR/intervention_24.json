They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves hiring a cleaner through an app where you select the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, which determines the hours. The user lied about the house size to get a 4-hour service, intending only the downstairs to be cleaned. The cleaner finished quickly and then went upstairs, but got upset when he realized there were more rooms than listed.\n\nFirst, the key points here are honesty and expectations. The cleaner was hired based on a specific number of rooms, which the user misrepresented. The app's system is designed to calculate hours based on the input provided. By altering the input, the user created a situation where the cleaner's expectations were different from the reality. The cleaner felt misled because he was under the impression that the listed rooms were all that needed cleaning, but when he saw more rooms upstairs, he was upset.\n\nThe user did explain to the cleaner that upstairs wasn't a priority and he could do as much as time allowed. However, the cleaner's reaction suggests he felt the user had a responsibility to be truthful from the start. The user's deception (not listing all rooms) led to a contract that didn't match the actual work required. Even if the user intended to use the extra time for upstairs, the cleaner was hired under false premises. The user's actions could be seen as deceitful, which the cleaner is justified in feeling angry about. \n\nAdditionally, the user might be in the wrong for not being transparent about the house's actual layout. The app's process is meant to ensure the cleaner is adequately compensated for the work. By manipulating that process, the user may have undermined the cleaner's right to fair pay for the actual work he could do. The fact that the cleaner finished downstairs quickly and was then faced with unexpected work might not be the user's fault, but the initial dishonesty is the crux of the issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the user's intention wasn't to get the cleaner to do more work but to save money by not paying for unnecessary hours. However, the cleaner's rights and the terms of the service agreement likely depend on accurate information. The user didn't inform the cleaner about the actual size from the beginning, leading to a breach of trust. So, ethically and contractually, the user is in the wrong.\n"
