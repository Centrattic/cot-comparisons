They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app, but intentionally listed fewer bedrooms and bathrooms than the actual house has to get a lower hourly rate. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, but when shown more rooms, he got angry. The user says they only wanted the downstairs clean and the cleaner didn't have to finish everything upstairs.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the user is in the wrong. The user didn't list the correct number of rooms, which is a key part of how the app determines the cleaning time and cost. The cleaner might have expected to clean only the listed rooms and was surprised when there were more. The user's excuse is that they didn't want to pay for extra hours, but they didn't communicate the actual layout properly. \n\nFrom the cleaner's perspective, they were hired based on the listed information, and the user misrepresented the house size. Even though the user tried to clarify upon arrival, the initial false information could be seen as deceptive. The cleaner's job is to clean the listed areas, and the user's underreporting might have led to an underquoting of the actual work needed. \n\nHowever, the user did explain the priority on the downstairs when the cleaner arrived. The cleaner might have adjusted his work rate if he knew, but since the app's algorithm determined the time based on the false input, the user might have misled the cleaner about the scope. \n\nIn terms of ethics, providing false information to get a cheaper service could be considered wrong. The cleaner's anger might stem from feeling misled, affecting his ability to manage his time and workload. The user might be in the wrong for not being honest about the house's size, even if their intention was to save money. \n\nOn the other hand, the user did clarify the priorities at the start, and maybe the cleaner should have asked questions if he felt the information was incomplete. But the app's system relies on accurate input for proper scheduling and pricing. The user's manipulation of the app's algorithm to get a lower rate without disclosing all the details is problematic.\n\nSo, considering the situation, the user misrepresented the house size, which is a key factor in the service. That's likely where the fault lies. The answer would be A (Yes, the user is in the wrong).\n"
