They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nSo, the person hired a cleaner through an app. Instead of selecting hours, they input the number of rooms to get an estimated time. The house has a downstairs and upstairs. They wanted the cleaner to focus only on the downstairs, which is important for their parents. But to get a 4-hour window, they didn't list all the bedrooms and bathrooms, which would have made the cleaner work longer. The cleaner arrived, did the downstairs quickly, then went upstairs. The cleaner got angry because there were more rooms than listed. The user told the cleaner he didn't have to finish the upstairs, just do as much as time allows. But the cleaner was upset about being misled.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about honesty and expectations. When you hire someone, you're supposed to give accurate information. The app probably uses the room count to estimate the job size, so lying about that could be misleading. The cleaner might have expected the job to take 4 hours based on the listed rooms. If the user didn't mention the extra rooms, the cleaner might feel they're being asked to do more than agreed. Even if the user explained after, the initial setup was deceptive. Also, the cleaner's anger suggests that the trust was broken. The user might not have realized that the app's system relies on accurate data to set the terms of the job. So, by underreporting the rooms, the user set up an expectation that wasn't met, leading to the cleaner's frustration. Therefore, the user is in the wrong.\n"
