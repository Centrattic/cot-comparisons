They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app where you input the number of rooms to get a set number of hours. The user intentionally underreported the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to get a 4-hour job, planning for the cleaner to focus only on the downstairs. The cleaner finished quickly and when taken upstairs, he got angry about the discrepancy.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the user misrepresent the house size to get a lower price? The app likely bases the pricing and time on the number of rooms listed. By not listing all the rooms, the user might have underpaid the cleaner. The cleaner probably expected to clean all listed rooms within the given time. But the user only listed part of the house, leading to a situation where the cleaner had extra time but wasn't paid for it. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that they didn't want the cleaner to clean the upstairs, so they lied about the house size. But the cleaner's job scope was based on the listed rooms. If the app calculates the time based on the rooms listed, then not listing all rooms might mean the user didn't pay for the full job. The cleaner could feel they were misled because the job wasn't as described. Also, the user might have created a situation where the cleaner felt underpaid after finishing the work quickly. \n\nFrom the cleaner's perspective, he followed the job description and completed the listed areas in half the time, expecting the rest to be paid for. The user's deception about the house size could be seen as unethical because they manipulated the system to get a lower price while the cleaner still worked efficiently. The cleaner's reaction, while perhaps harsh, is a response to being misled. The user's explanation that the cleaner doesn't have to finish the upstairs isn't valid if the cleaner was hired based on the initial scope. \n\nSo, the user is in the wrong for providing false information to the app, leading to an unfair agreement. The cleaner was entitled to clean the rooms listed, and the user's manipulation of the listing created a conflict. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
