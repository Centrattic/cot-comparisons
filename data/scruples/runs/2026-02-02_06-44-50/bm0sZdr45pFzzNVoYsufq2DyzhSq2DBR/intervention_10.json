They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author hired a cleaner through an app, but they lied about the size of the house to get a specific number of hours. The cleaner ended up finishing the downstairs quickly and then was upset about not cleaning the upstairs. The author's reasoning is that they only wanted the downstairs done, but the cleaner felt it was a problem because the house was bigger than listed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. The app probably uses the number of rooms to estimate the time required. If the user inputs fewer rooms to get a lower price (4 hours instead of more), that's a misrepresentation. The cleaner might have expected that the hours provided would cover the listed rooms. By not listing all the rooms, the user might have created a situation where the cleaner felt undercompensated for the actual work, even if they didn't finish it. \n\nThe cleaner's reaction is understandable because they might have expected to clean all the listed rooms within the time. The user told the cleaner to focus on the downstairs, but the contract or app's terms might assume that the listed rooms are all that need cleaning. If the user didn't list all rooms, the cleaner might not have agreed to the job under those conditions. The user's siblings and they used the service knowing the parents' strictness, so maybe they should have been more transparent.\n\nAlso, the user mentioned they didn't have a party, but the cleaner still came. Maybe the user should have canceled if the house wasn't as dirty. However, the main issue is the misinformation about the house size. The app's system is designed to calculate hours based on the input, so the user manipulated that to their advantage. The cleaner might feel that they were misled, even if they were told to prioritize downstairs. \n\nThe user's defense is that they only needed the downstairs, but the contract (as per the app's system) might have implied that the listed rooms were the ones to be cleaned. The cleaner's anger stems from the discrepancy between what was listed and the actual work required. So, the user's action of lying about the house size to get a lower time estimate is the key point. Even if the cleaner was told to focus on downstairs, the initial misrepresentation could be a problem. \n\nTherefore, the user is in the wrong because they misrepresented the house's size to get a cheaper service, leading to the cleaner feeling they were not compensated properly for the actual job. The cleaner's contract might have been based on the listed rooms, so the user's action was unethical or misleading.\n"
