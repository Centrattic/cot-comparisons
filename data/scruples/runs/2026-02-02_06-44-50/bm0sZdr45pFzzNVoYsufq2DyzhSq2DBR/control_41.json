They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying about the size of the house when hiring a cleaner. The situation is that the author used an app where you input the number of rooms to get an hour estimate. They underreported the rooms to get a 4-hour job, but the cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then got angry when shown more rooms upstairs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the contract terms. The app probably bases the hourly rate on the number of rooms listed. By misrepresenting the number of rooms, the author might have effectively underpaid the cleaner. The cleaner's job was determined by the app's calculation based on the info given. The author told the cleaner to focus on downstairs, but the contract might have implied that the cleaner would handle all listed rooms. \n\nThe cleaner's anger could be because he expected to clean the entire listed house. The author's explanation that the cleaner only needed to work the 4 hours might not hold if the contract was based on a specific scope of work. The key here is whether the app's terms require accurate room counts, and if the cleaner's services are tied to the listed areas.\n\nAlso, the author's siblings are adults, so they should be responsible for their agreements. The cleaner's attitude is unprofessional, but the author's deception (lying about room count) might be the root issue. The author might have created an unfair situation by not being transparent, leading to the cleaner's frustration. \n\nIn conclusion, the author likely misrepresented the job's scope, which could be considered wrong. The answer might be A, but I need to check if the app's terms require accurate information. If the app's pricing is based on room count, then the author didn't honor that, which is the cleaner's right to be upset. So the author is in the wrong for lying, even if the cleaner's reaction was harsh.\n"
