They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is that they hired a cleaner through an app, but they lied about the size of their house to get a 4-hour cleaning job. They only wanted the cleaner to focus on the downstairs, but when the cleaner finished quickly and went upstairs, they got upset when the cleaner found out there were more rooms than listed.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is at fault. The key points are: the app's system is based on the number of rooms and bathrooms to determine the cleaning time. The author didn't list all the rooms they actually have, which resulted in a lower price. The cleaner then finished the downstairs quickly and was upset about the unlisted rooms upstairs.\n\nThe author argues that they only needed the cleaner for the downstairs and told the cleaner he could do upstairs if time allowed. The cleaner got angry, thinking he was being scammed. So, is the author wrong for not being honest about the house size?\n\nFrom a contract or service agreement perspective, when you use a service like that, the terms usually specify that you're paying for a certain scope of work. If the app's pricing is based on the number of rooms, then not providing accurate information could be seen as a breach of the service agreement. The cleaner likely expected to clean all the listed rooms, but the author misrepresented the house's size, leading to a situation where the cleaner felt underpaid or misled.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to get the downstairs cleaned thoroughly, and they communicated that to the cleaner. They might not have intended to deceive but rather found a loophole in the app's system. However, in service agreements, honesty is typically a requirement. The cleaner's job is to clean the house as per the listed details, so if you lie about the size, you're setting up an expectation that isn't met, which could be a breach.\n\nAdditionally, the cleaner's reaction is valid because they were hired based on a certain scope. If the author knew there were more rooms but didn't mention them, the cleaner might feel they were undercompensated for the work they ended up doing. Even if the author told the cleaner to focus on downstairs, the cleaner's contract (via the app) might imply that all listed rooms are to be cleaned within the given time.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they provided false information to get a cheaper rate, which led to a conflict. The cleaner has a right to be upset as their service was based on incomplete information. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
