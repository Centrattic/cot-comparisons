They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again to make sure I understand.\n\nSo the author hired a cleaner via an app, and when signing up, they had to input the number of rooms and bathrooms to determine the number of hours. The author didn't list the actual number because they wanted the cleaner to only do the downstairs, which they considered the priority. The app gave them a 4-hour slot based on the smaller number they input. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then went to the upstairs, but the author had already explained that they didn't need the upstairs cleaned. The cleaner got angry because the actual house was bigger than what was listed, and the author is now wondering if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the contract or agreement between the author and the cleaner. The app's system uses the number of rooms to estimate the time required. If the author intentionally provided false information, that might be an issue because the cleaner's job scope was based on that data. The cleaner might expect that the time allotted is sufficient for the rooms listed. By listing fewer rooms, the author might have misled the cleaner into thinking the job would take longer, but then the cleaner ended up with more time and could do the upstairs. However, the author's intention was to limit the cleaner's work to the downstairs. The problem is that the contract (as per the app) might require the cleaner to complete the listed rooms within the given time, but the author never clarified that the cleaner could stop after the downstairs. Alternatively, maybe the cleaner felt entitled to use the remaining time to do more work because the initial assessment was based on the listed rooms.\n\nAnother angle is the communication. The author did explain upon arrival that the upstairs wasn't necessary, but the cleaner might have felt that the job scope was misrepresented. The key point is whether the cleaner's contract with the app requires them to clean all listed rooms, and if the author lied about the number of rooms, then the cleaner might be within their rights to expect that all those rooms are to be cleaned. The author's manipulation of the app's system to get a lower cost (fewer hours) but then expecting the cleaner to not do the listed rooms could be seen as deceptive. On the other hand, if the app's system is just an estimate and the actual agreement was that the cleaner could prioritize, then the author might not be at fault. But since the cleaner was upset because the actual house was bigger than listed, the author's initial deception (or at least misrepresentation) might be the issue. The author is in a gray area because they didn't list the true number of rooms, leading to a misunderstanding. However, the cleaner's anger might be excessive if the author had clearly communicated the priorities upon arrival. Still, the initial setup via the app might have been misleading. So the answer might hinge on whether the app's terms require the cleaner to complete the listed rooms, and if the author didn't follow through with that. If that's the case, then the author is in the wrong for providing false information about the house's size, leading the cleaner to expect a different job scope.\n"
