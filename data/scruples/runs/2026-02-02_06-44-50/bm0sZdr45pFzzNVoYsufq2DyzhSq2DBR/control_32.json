They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author hired a cleaner through an app. They listed the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to get a 4-hour cleaning time. However, they intentionally didn't list all the rooms they had because they only wanted the cleaner to focus on the downstairs. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, but when the author showed him the other rooms, the cleaner got angry because the actual number of rooms was higher than what was listed. The author explained that the upstairs wasn't as important and the cleaner could do as much as he wanted with the remaining time. The cleaner was still upset and the author is wondering if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. When you use an app like that, there's usually some kind of agreement about what's included based on the information you provide. If the app's pricing is based on the number of rooms, then lying about that could be a problem. The app probably uses that info to determine the time and cost, so the user might have underreported to get a cheaper rate. The cleaner might have expected to clean a certain number of rooms based on the listing, and the actual number was more, leading to his frustration.\n\nAlso, the author's intention was to only have the cleaner do the downstairs, but they didn't explicitly state that in the job description. The cleaner might have thought they were only hired for the listed rooms, not knowing there were more upstairs. The author's explanation after the fact might not change the cleaner's perception because the job listing was misleading.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the cleaner's time was calculated based on the provided info. If the actual workload is more than expected, they might feel underpaid or that their time was mismanaged. The author might be in the wrong for not being transparent about the full scope of the job initially, even if their intention was to save money. The cleaner's anger is understandable because they were given a task that required more work than they anticipated.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did specify that the downstairs was the priority and that the cleaner could do the upstairs if time allowed. However, the problem is that the job listing didn't reflect the true size of the house, leading to a mismatch in expectations. The app's system is designed to calculate time based on the number of rooms, so not providing accurate info could be seen as deceptive.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the cleaner might expect that the job listing is accurate. If the listing is incomplete, the user is at fault for not being honest, even if their intention was to limit the cleaner's work. The cleaner's time and effort might be based on the assumption that the listed rooms are the only ones to clean. The author's actions could be seen as trying to get more value for money by not being truthful, which is unethical.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author probably is in the wrong because they misrepresented the size of the house to get a lower cost and didn't communicate the full scope upfront. The cleaner relied on the information given to plan their work, and the author's deception led to the cleaner feeling cheated. Therefore, the answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
