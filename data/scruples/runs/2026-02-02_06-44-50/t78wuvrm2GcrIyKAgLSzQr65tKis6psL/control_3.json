And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for clipping their nails at work. The scenario involves a friend who clipped a hanging nail and then two more to even them out after getting reprimanded by a coworker. The coworker overheard the remark, confronted the friend, and then later sent a text expressing disgust about hearing the nail clipping from far away. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around workplace behavior. Clipping nails might be a matter of personal hygiene and practicality. The friend had a reason to trim a hanging nail, which could be uncomfortable or unsanitary. However, doing it in the cubicle where others can hear might be considered disruptive or unhygienic, depending on the workplace culture.\n\nThe coworker's reaction seems strong. Demanding not to clip and then texting later about the noise suggests that the coworker is particularly sensitive. The question is whether the friend overstepped by not only clipping the nail but adding two more, possibly out of spite or to assert their right. The phrase \"even things out\" might imply a bit of a reaction to the coworker's criticism.\n\nWorkplace etiquette often involves considering others' comfort. If the act of clipping is noisy and disturbing others, even in one's own space, it could be seen as inconsiderate. But there's also the aspect of personal hygiene. It's a balance between individual needs and collective workplace environment.\n\nThe friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, which could escalate tensions. However, the coworker's reaction was also intense. Depending on the company's policies, there might be guidelines about such activities. If there's no explicit policy against it, the friend might not be wrong. But if the company has rules against certain activities in the workspace, that could tip the scale.\n\nIn many workplaces, while there might not be a strict rule against clipping nails, it's generally expected to do so in a way that minimizes disruption. The friend might have acted inconsiderately by continuing after the coworker's complaint, but the initial act of clipping a necessary nail isn't inherently wrong. The key points are the context and the response to the feedback.\n\nSo, is the author (the friend) in the wrong? It depends on the balance between personal needs and workplace considerateness. The friend clipped a nail for a valid reason but then continued after being told it's a problem. The coworker's reaction is also a factor. However, the friend's actions could be seen as within their rights if there's no policy against it, but their response and the continuation might be inconsiderate. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) if there's no policy, but if the noise was unreasonable, maybe A. But given the scenario, the friend's actions don't seem malicious, so B might be the answer.\n"
