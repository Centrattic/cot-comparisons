And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the situation is about a friend who clipped her nails at work. Coworker B overheard her talking about having a hanging nail and clippers, then went into her cubicle and told her not to clip there because it's disgusting. Later, the friend did clip her nails and even clipped two more to \"even things out,\" which Coworker B then heard from 100 feet away and got upset again. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the friend (the author's friend) was in the wrong. The user is asking whether the author of the situation (the friend) is the asshole. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think.\n\nWell, let's break it down. Clipping nails at work can be a sensitive topic. Some people might find it gross because of the sound or the mess, while others might see it as a personal hygiene issue. The key points here are:\n\n1. The initial situation: She mentioned having a hanging nail and had clippers, which Coworker B overheard. Then B confronted her about not clipping there. So B is setting a boundary here, right? She's telling the friend not to do something she finds unacceptable.\n\n2. Then the friend proceeds to clip her nails anyway, even going so far as to clip two more to \"even things out.\" That seems like a provocation. If B told her not to do it, and she does it anyway, maybe even more so, that's being defiant. Also, clipping two more might be unnecessary, especially if it's just to look even. That could come off as being a bit of a jerk, just to annoy B.\n\n3. The response \"chill out\" isn't really addressing B's concerns. It's a dismissive response. If someone is upset about the sound and mess, saying \"chill out\" doesn't help. It might make B feel disrespected.\n\nSo, from a workplace etiquette perspective, if an employee is told not to do something, especially in a shared space, they should comply. Clipping nails can create noise and possibly small pieces of nail that could be considered messy. If the workplace has a policy against it, or even if it's a mutual agreement between coworkers, then disregarding that could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nBut wait, what if there's no official policy? Maybe the friend felt it was her right to do personal tasks during work hours. However, since Coworker B specifically asked her not to do it, the friend's continued action could be seen as ignoring a colleague's reasonable request. In a shared workspace, respecting others' comfort is important. If one person finds the action gross and disruptive, the other should consider their feelings, especially after being directly told.\n\nAlso, clipping two more nails to \"even things out\" seems like overcompensation. It's not just about the one hanging nail but adding more. That might be seen as mocking or intentionally annoying the other person. The friend's actions after being asked not to might be crossing a line.\n\nBut then again, some people might argue that clipping nails is a personal hygiene task and can be done in a cubicle, as long as it's not in someone's face. The sound might be an issue, but maybe that's part of the problem. So, maybe the friend did it in a private space, so it's not directly in front of B, but the sound still traveled. So even in a cubicle, the sound can carry in an office setting.\n\nIn that case, the friend might not be in the wrong for doing it in her own space, but the fact that she continued after being told not to, and then even clipped more, is problematic. The key issue is the respect for the coworker's feelings. If Coworker B is disturbed by it, the friend should have stopped. The friend's response of \"chill out\" is dismissive and not considering B's feelings. That could make the friend the asshole.\n\nSo putting it all together, the friend did clip her nails after being asked not to, and even went further, which escalates the situation. Her response is unhelpful. Therefore, the author (the friend) is in the wrong.\n"
