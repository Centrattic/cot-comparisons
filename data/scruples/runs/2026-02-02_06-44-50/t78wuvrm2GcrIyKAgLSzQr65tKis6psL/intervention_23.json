And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a friend who clipped her nails at work, leading to a conflict with a coworker. The main question is whether the author (the friend) is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, the friend noticed a hanging nail and used clippers. Then Coworker B overheard, confronted her, and demanded she stop. The friend then clipped more nails and sent a dismissive response. Coworker B was upset about the noise and found it gross.\n\nSo, is clipping nails at work wrong? It's a common debate. Some people find the sound of nail clippers unpleasant or distracting, especially in an office setting. On the other hand, everyone has to maintain their hygiene, and sometimes doing so at work is necessary. The key factors here are the context and workplace policies.\n\nThe friend did it in her own cubicle, which is a private space. But Coworker B could hear from 100 feet away, implying the sound traveled. The friend's response was \"chill out,\" which might come off as dismissive. Coworker B felt it was gross, so the friend's actions affected others.\n\nWorkplace etiquette often involves being considerate of others. Even if the act itself isn't inherently wrong, doing it in a way that disturbs others could be. The friend could have asked Coworker B if it was okay or done it during a break or in a less noticeable time. The confrontation escalated because the friend didn't back down and even clipped more nails after being asked to stop.\n\nIn many workplaces, there's an unspoken rule about certain personal grooming tasks. While there's no universal policy, being mindful of others' comfort is important. The friend might not be in the wrong entirely, but her response and continuation of the action after being told could make her the asshole. The coworker's sensitivity is valid, but the friend's dismissiveness and actions after the request might tip the scales.\n"
