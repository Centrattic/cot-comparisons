And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author (the friend) is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she clipped her nails at work, which Coworker B found disgusting. The friend did it after B told her not to, and then clipped two more nails. B was really bothered by it, even from 100 feet away. \n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace etiquette. Clipping nails at work is a common thing people do, but maybe in some workplaces, it's seen as unhygienic or disruptive. The friend was in her own cubicle, so maybe she thought it was private. But B heard her from far away, which suggests the sound was a problem. \n\nIs it gross? Some people might find the sound of nail clippers unpleasant, like how some people dislike the sound of chewing. But is it actually unhygienic? Clipping nails is normal, but doing it in a shared space might be an issue. Maybe the friend should have done it in a restroom or a more private area. \n\nThe friend responded with \"chill out\" when B confronted her. That response might come off as dismissive. B was clearly upset, so maybe the friend should have acknowledged B's discomfort instead of being defensive. \n\nWorkplace norms vary. If the workplace has a policy against certain activities, clipping nails might be against the rules. If not, then maybe it's just a matter of personal preference. However, if someone is specifically bothered by it, the friend should consider their feelings. \n\nAlso, after B told her not to clip, the friend did it anyway, which shows she didn't respect B's request. That's probably the main issue here. Even if it's a personal habit, ignoring a colleague's request for a quieter or more hygienic workspace could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the friend might be in the wrong because she didn't respect her coworker's feelings and continued the action after being asked to stop. The response \"chill out\" wasn't helpful. Therefore, Answer A: Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
