And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The friend had a hanging nail and clipped it in her cubicle. Then she clipped two more to even them out. Coworker B overheard the comment, got upset, told her not to do it in the office, and later texted her that it was disgusting. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the main points are: the friend clipped her nails in her cubicle, which is a private space. She did it after Coworker B told her not to. The coworker is clearly offended by the noise and the act itself. The friend's response is dismissive.\n\nNow, considering office etiquette. Generally, people might consider nail clipping annoying because of the noise, but it's a personal hygiene task. However, if someone is in a private space like a cubicle, maybe it's acceptable. But Coworker B seems particularly sensitive here.\n\nIs the friend in the wrong? If she was in her own cubicle, she might have the right to do personal things. But Coworker B was upset, and the friend did it again after being told to stop. The friend's response of \"chill out\" could be seen as dismissive and not respecting the coworker's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, Coworker B might be overreacting. But the friend did clip nails after being asked to stop, which could be seen as disregarding the coworker's request. Also, the friend clipped more than necessary after the initial one, which might be unnecessary and contribute to the noise.\n\nSo, the friend's actions after being told to stop are problematic. Even if it's a personal task, ignoring a colleague's request and continuing could be seen as inconsiderate. The response \"chill out\" is also dismissive. Therefore, the friend might be in the wrong for not respecting the coworker's feelings and continuing the action after being asked to stop.\n"
