And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author (the friend) is in the wrong here. So the situation is about clipping nails at work. The friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. A coworker overheard the comment, then another coworker (B) demanded she not do it because it's gross. The friend then clipped more nails and got a text from coworker B saying it's disgusting to hear from far away. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace etiquette. Clipping nails at work... is that common? Some people might do it if they don't have time at home, but others find it unhygienic or disruptive. The key points here are the reaction of coworker B. She found it so disturbing that she confronted the friend and then later sent a text about hearing it from 100 feet away. The friend's response was dismissive.\n\nNow, the question is whether the friend was wrong. On one hand, the friend was in her own cubicle, clipping nails, which might be seen as a personal activity. However, the noise from the clippers could be a disturbance, especially in an open office. The friend clipped three nails after the initial one, which might have been unnecessary once she started. Also, responding with \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive or not taking coworker B's feelings seriously.\n\nBut then, coworker B's reaction seems extreme too. Maybe the friend wasn't doing anything that's against workplace rules unless specified. If the workplace doesn't have a policy against it, the friend isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, if the action is causing discomfort to others, even if it's not a rule, it could be considered inconsiderate.\n\nSo, there are two sides here. The friend might be inconsiderate by not considering that the noise could bother others, especially after being warned. On the other hand, coworker B's reaction might be overly sensitive. The friend's action of clipping three nails after the first could be seen as retaliatory or just not stopping after being asked. The \"chill out\" response might not help de-escalate the situation.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, personal grooming in the workplace can be tricky. If it's necessary and done discreetly, it's usually acceptable. However, if it's noisy and others are disturbed, maybe the friend should have done it elsewhere, like in a restroom or during a break. Since coworker B was clearly bothered, the friend might be at fault for not considering others' comfort. Also, clipping three nails after being told could be seen as escalating the issue.\n\nSo, considering all that, the friend's actions might be inconsiderate, leading to the answer that the author is in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn because sometimes people do clip nails at work without issues. The main issue here is the reaction from coworker B and the friend's response. Maybe the friend should have been more considerate to avoid disturbing others.\n"
