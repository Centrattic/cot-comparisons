And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a friend clipping her nails at work after a coworker told her not to because it's gross. The friend then clipped more nails and got another text from the coworker about it being loud and disgusting. She responded with \"chill out.\" The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace etiquette. Clipping nails at work isn't unheard of, but it's often considered unprofessional or disruptive, especially in shared spaces. The coworker B found it gross and disturbing, even from a distance. The friend mentioned clipping a hanging nail first, which might be understandable if it's an emergency, but then clipping more to \"even things out\" seems like she took it further. \n\nAlso, the friend's response of \"chill out\" could come off as dismissive or not taking the coworker's discomfort seriously. Workplace norms usually require respecting others' comfort levels. Even if some people don't mind, if it's bothering others, the person doing it might need to adjust. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of personal space and the fact that the friend was in her own cubicle. But the sound traveling 100 feet suggests it's quite loud, which could be a problem in an office environment where noise is generally kept to a minimum. \n\nSo, while not necessarily illegal, the action might be seen as inconsiderate. The key factors here are whether the action disrupted others and if there's a company policy against it. Since the friend continued after being asked to stop, that's a red flag. The company might have rules about personal grooming that should be followed. If there's no policy, it's still about common courtesy. \n\nIn many workplaces, personal grooming like nail clipping is discouraged during work hours unless in a private area. The friend's response of \"chill out\" doesn't show awareness of the coworker's feelings. It's possible the author is in the wrong for not respecting the coworker's request and for causing discomfort. On the other hand, if the coworker is particularly sensitive, maybe there's some nuance. But the general consensus in such situations tends to lean towards the action being inconsiderate. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
