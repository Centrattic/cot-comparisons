And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author (the friend in the story) is in the wrong here. The situation is about clipping nails at work. The friend had a hanging nail and used clippers, which was overheard by Coworker B, who then told her not to do it because it's disgusting. The friend then clipped a couple more nails to even them out and received another complaint from Coworker B.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Clipping nails at work isn't uncommon, but maybe it's considered unprofessional or disruptive in some environments. The key points here are that Coworker B was offended enough to confront the friend and then send a text later. The friend's response was \"chill out,\" which might not be the best approach if someone is genuinely upset.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend was in her own cubicle, so maybe she felt it was her right to handle her personal grooming there. However, the act of clipping nails can be noisy and might spread small bits of nail, which some people find unhygienic. The friend clipping multiple nails after the initial one could have been seen as provocation, especially if Coworker B was already upset.\n\nWorkplace etiquette usually suggests that personal grooming should be done discreetly, perhaps in a private area or during breaks. If the workplace has specific rules about such things, that would matter. But if there's no such rule, it's more about mutual respect. The friend might have overstepped by continuing after being told it was an issue, even if it was just in her own space. The response \"chill out\" might have been dismissive, not showing empathy towards Coworker B's feelings.\n\nSo, considering all this, the friend did something that upset a coworker, and then continued the action after being asked to stop. That seems like being in the wrong. The answer might be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
