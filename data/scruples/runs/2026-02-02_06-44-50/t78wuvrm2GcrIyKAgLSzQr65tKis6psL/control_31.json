And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about whether clipping nails at work makes someone the asshole. The friend clipped a hanging nail and then two more to even them out. Coworker B was really upset, even hearing it from 100 feet away. The friend responded with \"chill out.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace etiquette. Clipping nails can be seen as unhygienic or disruptive. Some people find the sound annoying. But others might think it's a personal hygiene issue that's acceptable if done discreetly.\n\nThe friend did it in her cubicle, which is semi-private. But coworker B was clearly disturbed. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might have been dismissive. However, the friend had a reason to clip a hanging nail, which isn't gross in itself. Clipping two more to even them out might be seen as unnecessary, but maybe she had a reason.\n\nThe key points are: Was the action itself inherently wrong, or was it the friend's response? If coworker B is sensitive, maybe the friend should have been more considerate. But if the action isn't against company policy, maybe the friend isn't at fault. \n\nAlso, the friend's cubicle is her space, so doing something personal there isn't necessarily wrong. However, making noise that others can hear from far away might be disruptive. The friend's response of \"chill out\" could be seen as not taking the coworker's feelings into account. \n\nIn some workplaces, people do personal grooming as long as it's not disruptive. But if it's causing a disturbance, then maybe the friend should avoid it during work hours. The answer hinges on whether the action was disruptive and how the friend responded. If the friend was aware of the coworker's sensitivity and still did it, maybe she's in the wrong. But if the coworker is being overly sensitive, then the friend isn't. Since the coworker explicitly told her not to do it, the friend might have been inconsiderate by continuing. So, possible answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
