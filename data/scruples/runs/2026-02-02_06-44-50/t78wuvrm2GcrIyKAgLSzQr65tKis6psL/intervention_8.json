And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author (the friend) is in the wrong here. The situation is about clipping nails at work, which leads to some conflict.\n\nFirst, the friend had a hanging nail and clipped it. Then, after Coworker B complained, she clipped two more nails to \"even things out.\" Coworker B was clearly disturbed by the noise and found it disgusting. The friend's response was \"chill out,\" which might come off as dismissive.\n\nNow, in an office setting, people have different sensitivities. Clipping nails can be noisy and maybe considered unhygienic by some. If Coworker B heard it from 100 feet away, it's a loud sound that could distract others. The friend might not have realized the impact of the noise on coworkers. Also, the act of clipping nails in a shared workspace could be seen as inconsiderate if it's bothering others. The friend's response of \"chill out\" didn't address Coworker B's concerns and might have escalated the issue. \n\nHowever, there's an argument that people might need to take care of personal grooming at work. But doing it in a way that disrupts others is problematic. The friend didn't consider that her actions could be disturbing to coworkers, which might make her the asshole. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she didn't consider others' feelings and responded dismissively.\n"
