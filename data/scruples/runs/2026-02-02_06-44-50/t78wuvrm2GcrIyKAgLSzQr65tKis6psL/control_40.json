And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation involves a coworker getting upset and confronting her, then the author responding with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Clipping nails at work isn't typically something people do in public spaces, but it's not illegal or against most company policies unless specified. However, doing it in a shared office area might be seen as unhygienic or disturbing to others, especially if the sound is loud and noticeable over a distance.\n\nThe coworker's reaction seems strong\u2014calling it disgusting and hearing it from 100 feet away. The author clipped multiple nails after the initial one, which might have compounded the issue. The response of \"chill out\" could come off as dismissive, which might have escalated tensions.\n\nWorkplace etiquette often emphasizes consideration for others. Even if there's no explicit rule against it, creating noise or mess that affects others can be frowned upon. The key points here are the potential disruption caused and the reaction of the coworker. The author might not be the asshole, but there's a valid point on both sides. However, since the coworker's discomfort was legitimate and the author continued after being confronted, maybe the author did cross a line. On the other hand, the coworker's reaction might be over the top. Hmm, tricky. I think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because she continued after being told and dismissed the other person's concern.\n"
