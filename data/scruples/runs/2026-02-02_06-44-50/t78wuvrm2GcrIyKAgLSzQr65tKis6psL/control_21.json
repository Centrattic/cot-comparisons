And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend in the story) is in the wrong for clipping nails at work. The question is presented as an AITA scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The friend clipped her nails because she had a hanging one, which she fixed using clippers. Then, when Coworker B overheard and complained, she clipped two more to even them out. Coworker B then texted her about hearing the nail clipping from far away and called it disgusting. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the key points here are: the initial clipping was out of necessity (hanging nail), then she did two more. The main issue is whether clipping nails at work is considered gross or inappropriate. \n\nI should consider workplace norms. In many offices, it's common to see people doing quick personal grooming tasks like clipping nails, especially if it's a quick fix. However, some people might find the sound or the act itself unpleasant. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, which could escalate the situation. \n\nBut the friend acted in her own cubicle, so it's not like she was doing it in a shared space. The fact that she did it after Coworker B complained might be seen as a reaction rather than an intentional annoyance. However, clipping two more nails after the initial one could be perceived as unnecessary, especially if Coworker B was already upset. \n\nThe debate here hinges on differing perspectives: some might see it as a normal, private task, while others find it gross, especially if they can hear it. The friend's response might have been too casual, not addressing Coworker B's discomfort. But was she wrong? It's a judgment call. Since she was in her own cubicle and it wasn't a major disruption, I might lean towards her not being in the wrong. However, the act of clipping after being told not to could be seen as provoking. \n\nI need to check if there's a standard policy against this. If the workplace has a rule, that would change things, but the scenario doesn't mention any. So, assuming no policy, it's more about social etiquette. The friend might not be in the wrong if she didn't intentionally annoy, but she could have handled it better. Since the question is a yes/no, and the user is asking if she's in the wrong, probably answer B (No) because it's a common enough thing and she was in her own space. The other person is more sensitive, but the friend's action isn't inherently wrong.\n"
