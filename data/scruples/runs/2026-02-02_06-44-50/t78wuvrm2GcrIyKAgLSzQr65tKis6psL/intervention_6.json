And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a friend clipping her nails at work, and a coworker is upset about it. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider work etiquette. Clipping nails at work might be seen as unprofessional or disruptive. Some people might find it gross because nail clippers can make noise and there's the potential for debris. The coworker in the story was pretty adamant, even hearing the clipping from 100 feet away and calling it disgusting. That suggests it's a big deal to her.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's friend was in her own cubicle. She had a valid reason for clipping a hanging nail, which could be uncomfortable. She then clipped two more to even them out, which might not be strictly necessary but could be for aesthetic reasons. The response of \"chill out\" might not be the best approach, as it could escalate the situation.\n\nWorkplace policies often mention things like keeping the workspace clean and not disturbing others. If the act of clipping nails is causing a disturbance, then the employee might be violating those policies. However, if the coworker is overly sensitive, maybe the issue is more about personal preference than a real problem.\n\nThe key factors here are whether the action is disruptive and if it's against company policy. Since the coworker was disturbed enough to confront and text again, it's possible that the author's actions are seen as inappropriate. But if the company doesn't have a rule against it, it's a judgment call. However, considering social norms in the workplace, it's generally advised to avoid activities that could be considered unsanitary or distracting. So, the author might be in the wrong for not considering her coworker's feelings and the general workplace decorum.\n"
