And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author, which is the friend in this situation, is in the wrong. So, the friend clipped her nails at work, which was overheard by a coworker who found it disgusting. The coworker then confronted her, and the friend clipped more nails, leading to another complaint.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether clipping nails at work is generally acceptable. Some people might find it gross because they associate nail clippers with home use or consider it messy. Others might not mind if it's done discreetly. The key points here are the context and how it's done. The friend was in her own cubicle, which is a semi-private space, but workspaces are usually shared environments. Clipping nails can create noise and small debris, which might be a concern for others nearby.\n\nThe coworker B was clearly upset, even to the point of demanding she stop and then later sending a text about hearing it from 100 feet away. This suggests that the noise was a significant issue. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, which could escalate the situation. \n\nWorkplace etiquette often emphasizes considering others' comfort. While it's not illegal, it's about social norms. If an action is causing discomfort to others, even if it's a personal need, the person might need to adjust their behavior. Since the friend was aware of the coworker's discomfort but continued, maybe she didn't consider the impact enough. However, everyone has personal grooming needs, and it's a bit of a grey area. \n\nBut given that the coworker was so bothered by it and the friend didn't stop despite the initial complaint, perhaps the friend didn't take the concern seriously. The act of clipping nails isn't inherently wrong, but the way it was handled might have been inconsiderate. So, maybe the friend is at least partially at fault here. Answer A would mean she's in the wrong, B that she isn't. The balance here is whether the action is objectively wrong or just a difference in opinion. Since it's a subjective issue, but the friend didn't show enough consideration for coworker B's feelings after being told, leaning towards A.\n"
