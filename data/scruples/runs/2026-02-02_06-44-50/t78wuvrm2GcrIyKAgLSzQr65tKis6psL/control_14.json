And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author's friend is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work.\n\nFirst, the situation: the friend had a hanging nail and clipped it. Then, she clipped two more to even them out. Coworker B overheard the initial comment and told her not to do it because it's disgusting. Later, when the friend did it again, Coworker B texted her about hearing it from far away and called it gross. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nClipping nails at work is a common enough thing, right? People might do it in their own space, like a cubicle, to maintain hygiene. A hanging nail could be uncomfortable, so trimming it makes sense. But Coworker B seems to find it gross, even from a distance. The noise might be an issue if it's disturbing others. The friend clipped more nails after the initial one, which might have made the noise more noticeable. \n\nBut is it the friend's fault? Well, she was in her own cubicle, which is her personal space. Clipping nails there isn't inherently wrong. However, if the sound is causing a disturbance, maybe she should be considerate. The fact that Coworker B could hear from 100 feet away suggests the clippers are loud, which could be a problem. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, especially since she knew Coworker B had an issue before. \n\nBut Coworker B's reaction is also over the top. Calling it \"disgusting\" and \"gross\" might be an extreme response. People have different sensitivities. The friend's actions were probably within acceptable workplace norms, but maybe she could have been more considerate by doing it at a time when it's less disruptive. However, the primary responsibility is on Coworker B to handle the situation politely rather than confronting her in person and then texting again. \n\nSo overall, the friend isn't in the wrong. She was maintaining her hygiene in her own space. The real issue is Coworker B's overreaction. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
