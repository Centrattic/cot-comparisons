And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The scenario is about a friend clipping her nails at work. Coworker B overhears her mentioning a hanging nail and her clippers, then confronts her, saying it's disgusting. My friend clips her nails, then a couple more to even them out. Then Coworker B texts her that she heard from afar and found it gross. Friend responds \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the friend (the author) was wrong. The question is whether clipping nails at work is an asshole move.\n\nPublic vs. private: Nail clipping usually done at home. In an office, it might be seen as unprofessional or disruptive. Even in a cubicle, the sound might carry. The friend did it after being told not to, so maybe escalating the situation. Clipping more nails after the initial one could be seen as defiant. The response \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, adding to the tension.\n\nBut the friend used her own cubicle, which is a private space. However, shared workspaces can be a gray area. Some people might consider it gross, others not. It's subjective. The coworker's reaction is also extreme, maybe overreacting. But the act itself could be considered unprofessional in a work setting. So the friend might be in the wrong for doing it after being asked and then responding flippantly. Or maybe not, since she was in her own space.\n\nFactors to consider: workplace policies? If there's no rule against it, maybe not. But norms matter too. The coworker's sensitivity is a factor. The friend's actions after being told not to could be the issue. The act of clipping nails is common, but in an office, it's a social norm issue. The friend's actions might be seen as disregarding others' comfort, even if it's minor. The response \"chill out\" might not help. So maybe the friend is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
