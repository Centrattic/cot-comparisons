Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author, who is the friend in the scenario, is the asshole for clipping her nails at work. The situation involves Coworker B getting upset because she heard the nail clippers from her cubicle, which is over 100 feet away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace etiquette. Clipping nails at work might be a sensitive topic because some people find the sound unpleasant. But is it inherently wrong? The friend had a hanging nail, which could be uncomfortable or unsanitary, so she clipped it in her cubicle. Then she clipped two more to even them out, which seems like a reasonable action to maintain neatness.\n\nCoworker B's reaction seems extreme. She confronted the friend and then later texted her about being disturbed by the sound. The friend responded with \"chill out,\" which might come off as dismissive. However, the friend was in her own cubicle and didn't cause a disturbance beyond the sound. If the cubicles are soundproofed, maybe the noise wasn't an issue, but Coworker B's sensitivity might be a personal preference rather than a legitimate problem.\n\nWorkplace norms vary. In some offices, it's acceptable to do minor grooming tasks if done quietly and discreetly. The friend was in her own space, so it's not like she was doing it in a shared area where others would be more directly affected. The act of clipping nails isn't inherently gross, but the sound can be annoying to some people. However, unless there's a specific workplace policy against it, it's hard to say the friend is wrong. \n\nThe key points are whether the friend's actions were disruptive. Since she did it in her cubicle and the noise was the only issue, it's more about personal sensitivity. The friend's response to Coworker B's text might have been better phrased, but the action itself isn't necessarily wrong. Coworker B's reaction is subjective, so the friend isn't the asshole here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
