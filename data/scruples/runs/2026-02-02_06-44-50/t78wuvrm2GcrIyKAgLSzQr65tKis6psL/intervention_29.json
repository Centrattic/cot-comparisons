And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend in the story) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. They want a yes or no answer based on the given scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. The friend had a hanging nail and clipped it at work. Another coworker overheard, got upset, and told her not to do it again. The friend then clipped a couple more nails, and the coworker heard from far away, leading to more complaints. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether this is an asshole move. Let's break it down. Clipping nails can be considered gross or disruptive in an office setting because it can create noise and debris. However, it's a common task people do, and maybe in some workplaces, it's acceptable as long as it's done discreetly.\n\nThe key points here are:\n1. The initial act of clipping a hanging nail: Is that unreasonable? Maybe if done in a private space, it's okay, but in a shared office with cubicles, it might be more noticeable.\n2. The friend clipped more nails after the first incident. That could be seen as provocation, especially after being told not to do it.\n3. The response \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, which could escalate the situation.\n\nWorkplace etiquette often depends on the company culture. If the office has no specific rules against it, maybe it's not the friend's fault. But if coworkers find it objectionable, then it's a matter of considering others' feelings. The friend might not have realized the impact, but continuing after being asked to stop could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nAlso, the coworker's reaction seems strong, but the friend's actions after being told to stop might be the issue. Clipping more nails could be seen as disregarding the coworker's feelings, which could make the friend the asshole.\n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she continued clipping after being asked to stop, which shows a lack of consideration for her coworker's discomfort.\n"
