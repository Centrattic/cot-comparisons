And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (my friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. \n\nFirst, the situation: she mentions having a hanging nail and uses clippers at her cubicle. Coworker B overhears, confronts her, and then later texts her that the noise is disgusting. The friend then clips more nails, leading to the conflict.\n\nSo, the key points to consider are company policies, social norms in the workplace, and mutual respect. \n\n1. **Company Policy**: The first thing to check is if there's a specific rule against clipping nails at work. If there is, then the friend would be in the wrong. But the scenario doesn't mention any such policy, so we can't assume that. Without a policy, it's more about social etiquette.\n\n2. **Social Etiquette**: In many workplaces, clipping nails can be seen as unhygienic or disruptive. The sound of clippers might be annoying to others, especially in an open office. However, doing it in your own cubicle or private space might be considered more acceptable than in common areas. The friend did it in her cubicle, which is a personal space, so that's a point in her favor.\n\n3. **Intent and Context**: The friend clipped a hanging nail first, which is a practical need. Then she clipped two more to \"even things out,\" which could be seen as unnecessary. The follow-up action might be where the issue starts. If she had only done what was necessary, maybe it's less of a problem. But adding extra clippings could be perceived as dismissive of Coworker B's initial complaint.\n\n4. **Reaction of Coworker B**: Coworker B was upset and even heard the clippers from a distance. The friend's response of \"chill out\" was dismissive, which might have escalated the situation. This response could be seen as not taking Coworker B's feelings seriously, which is a social faux pas.\n\n5. **Mutual Respect**: In a workplace, respecting others' comfort is important. If the friend knew that Coworker B found it gross, continuing to clip nails and responding dismissively shows a lack of consideration. Even if the act itself isn't against the rules, the way the friend handled the interaction might be problematic.\n\nPutting it all together: The friend's actions were in a private cubicle, which is a bit more justified, but the additional clipping after the complaint and the dismissive response could make her the asshole. However, if there's no policy against it, the main issue is the interpersonal response. So the answer might depend on whether the act itself is objectively wrong or if the problem is in the reaction. Since the question is about the author being in the wrong, the key factors are the unnecessary clipping after the complaint and the dismissive reply. That leans towards answer A (Yes, she's in the wrong). But some might argue B (No) if they believe nail clipping is a personal hygiene matter and the response was the issue. However, the combination of actions makes A more likely.\n"
