And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. So the situation is about clipping nails at work. The friend clipped a hanging nail and then clipped two more to even them out. Another coworker heard it from over 100 feet away and found it disgusting. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Generally, people might clip their nails when necessary, but doing it at work can be a point of contention. Some might find the sound of nail clippers unpleasant or disruptive, especially in an open office. If someone is doing it in their own cubicle and not disturbing others, maybe it's okay. But if it's loud and others are bothered by it, that's a problem.\n\nThe coworker B seems to be pretty upset, even going as far as confronting the friend and texting her again later. The friend's response to \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, especially if someone is genuinely uncomfortable. The friend's action of clipping after being told not to might escalate the issue. The initial clipping for a hanging nail is understandable, but clipping two more could be seen as unnecessary and done for the friend's own satisfaction rather than necessity.\n\nWorkplace etiquette often involves considering others' comfort. Even if it's a minor thing, if it's causing distress, maybe the friend should have been more considerate. However, it's also possible that coworker B is being overly sensitive. The key is whether the action was reasonable and if the friend overstepped by continuing after being asked to stop.\n\nSo, the author's friend might be at fault for continuing to clip nails after being told it's bothering someone else. The response \"chill out\" doesn't address the concern and could be seen as rude. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a middle ground where both parties have some responsibility.\n"
