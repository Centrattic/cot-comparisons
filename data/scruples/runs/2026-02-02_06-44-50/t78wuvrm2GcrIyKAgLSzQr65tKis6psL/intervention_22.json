And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation involves a friend clipping her nails at work after a coworker told her not to. So, first, the friend initially mentions having a hanging nail and uses her clippers. Then Coworker B overhears and tells her not to clip nails there because it's disgusting. The friend then clips her nails in her cubicle, then does two more to even them out. Coworker B is upset because she can hear the clippers from far away and calls it gross. The friend responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nNow, is the friend in the wrong? Let's consider workplace norms. Nail clipping can be a point of contention. While it's a personal hygiene task, doing it in a shared workspace might be seen as unhygienic or disruptive by some. The key factors here are the location and the reaction. The friend did it in her own cubicle, which is her space, but Coworker B was clearly disturbed by the noise and the act itself.\n\nThe initial instruction from Coworker B might have been a bit over the top, but the friend's response of continuing to clip and then texting \"chill out\" could come off as dismissive. The friend didn't consider that Coworker B's sensitivity might be valid. Even if nail clipping isn't inherently wrong, respecting others' comfort is part of workplace etiquette. The friend's actions after being asked not to do it might be seen as disregarding a colleague's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, Coworker B's reaction is quite strong. Maybe she's being overly sensitive. But in a professional setting, if someone asks you to stop doing something that's bothering them, even if it's a minor thing, it's usually best to comply. The friend could have done the nail clipping at a different time or place. Since she was in her own cubicle, maybe it's her right to do it there, but the noise and the fact that she continued after being asked might tip the balance.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the friend might have been inconsiderate by continuing the action after being told it's an issue. Workplace harmony is important, and even if the act itself isn't gross, the response to the coworker's concern matters. Therefore, the friend might be in the wrong.\n"
