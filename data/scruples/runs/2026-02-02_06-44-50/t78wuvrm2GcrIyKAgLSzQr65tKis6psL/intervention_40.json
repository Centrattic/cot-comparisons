And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that the friend mentioned a hanging nail and clipped it, then continued to clip two more. Coworker B overheard and got upset, even texting her that it was disgusting and they could hear it from far away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Clipping nails at work might be a personal preference, but some people find it gross or unhygienic. The friend justified it by saying she had a hanging nail, which could be a legitimate reason to address immediately. However, clipping two more nails just to \"even things out\" might be seen as unnecessary.\n\nCoworker B's reaction seems strong. They confronted the friend in person and then followed up with a text. The friend responded with \"chill out,\" which could be dismissive. The question is whether the friend overstepped by continuing after being asked to stop.\n\nWorkplace etiquette often involves considering others' comfort. Even if personal grooming is necessary, doing it in a way that doesn't disturb others is important. Clipping nails in an open cubicle might be audible and visually unappealing to some. The friend might be in the wrong for not respecting Coworker B's sensitivity, especially after being directly asked to stop. The act of continuing and even clipping more nails could be seen as defiant, leading to a conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, Coworker B's reaction could be overly sensitive. Maybe the friend didn't do anything objectively wrong, but the social dynamics matter. The key here is whether the friend acted inconsiderately. Since Coworker B was clearly bothered, the friend's actions might be considered inconsiderate despite being a minor action. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because she didn't consider the coworker's feelings and continued after being asked.\n"
