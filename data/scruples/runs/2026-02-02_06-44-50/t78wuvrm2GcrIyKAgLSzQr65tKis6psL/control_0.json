And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that her coworker overheard her talking about a hanging nail and then complained about it, even hearing the clipping from far away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common workplace norms. Clipping nails at work might be seen as unhygienic or distracting to others. Some people might find the sound of nail clippers unpleasant, especially if it's done frequently or loudly. But on the other hand, people might do it out of necessity, like fixing a snagged nail, and not realize it's bothering others.\n\nThe friend clipped a hanging nail first, which could be reasonable. Then she clipped two more to \"even things out,\" which might be where it becomes unnecessary. The coworker was clearly upset by the noise and perceived it as gross. The friend's response was to tell her to \"chill out,\" which could come off as dismissive.\n\nI should think about whether the action itself is objectively wrong or if it's subjective. Workplaces can have different policies, but if there's no specific rule against it, maybe it's more about sensitivities. The key points are the noise disturbing others and the judgment about what's acceptable in a shared space.\n\nSo, the friend might not be in the wrong for the initial clipping, but doing it further after being asked to stop could be problematic. However, the coworker's reaction is also extreme. The debate is between hygiene/personal care vs. others' comfort. Since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, considering the escalation (clipping more after the initial complaint) and the dismissive response, maybe she's partially at fault. But maybe not entirely, as some people might find it annoying without it being objectively wrong.\n\nHmm. The answer might hinge on whether the action is against company policy or a common courtesy issue. Since there's no mention of policy, it's more about social norms. In some cultures, it's acceptable, others not. The friend's action led to discomfort, so maybe she's in the wrong. But it's a grey area. The answer is probably A (yes) because the action disturbed others, and she continued after being asked. But maybe B (no) if it's a personal right. I'm a bit torn, but leaning towards A.\n"
