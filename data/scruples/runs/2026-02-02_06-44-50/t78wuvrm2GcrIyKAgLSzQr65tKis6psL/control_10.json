And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation involves a coworker getting upset and telling her not to do it, then another coworker hearing it from far away and calling it disgusting.\n\nFirst, the act of clipping nails itself. In some workplaces, people might find it gross because of the noise or the visual. The coworker B found it \"disgusting,\" so it's a matter of personal discomfort. But is it a violation of company policy? The scenario doesn't mention any rules against it. So maybe the friend isn't breaking any rules, just doing something that some people find annoying.\n\nThen there's the response. The friend clipped her nail and then did two more to \"even things out.\" That might come off as defensive or a bit of a petty retaliation against coworker B's complaint. The response of \"chill out\" could also be seen as dismissive, which might escalate the situation. \n\nBut on the other hand, the friend was in her cubicle, which is a semi-private space. People often do personal tasks in their cubicles, like eating lunch or using a phone. Clipping nails might be considered a personal grooming task. However, the noise traveling across the office could be an issue if it's distracting others. \n\nCoworker B's reaction seems strong. Maybe she's overreacting, but her feelings are valid. The question is whether the friend overstepped by not just clipping one nail but doing two more after being told. The act of doing more than necessary might be seen as inconsiderate, even if the initial clipping wasn't a big deal.\n\nSo, is the friend the asshole? It depends on the workplace culture. If others find it gross but it's not against policy, the friend might not be in the wrong. But her response to do two more after being asked could be seen as a bit of an asshole move because it's a direct reaction to the complaint. The dismissive reply also doesn't help. \n\nBut maybe coworker B is being overly sensitive. It's a common debate. In the end, unless there's a policy against it, the friend isn't necessarily wrong, but her actions after the complaint might be. However, the main question is if she's in the wrong. Since there's no policy mentioned, and people have different sensitivities, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, her actions post-complaint could tip it. Hmm.\n"
