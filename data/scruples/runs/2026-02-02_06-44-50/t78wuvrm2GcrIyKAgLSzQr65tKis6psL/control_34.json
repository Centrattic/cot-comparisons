Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle.

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this AITA scenario. The user is asking whether the friend (the author's friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The story involves a coworker getting upset because she heard the nail clipping from her cubicle and found it disgusting. The friend clipped the nails after mentioning it to another coworker, then clipped more to even them out, and responded with \"chill out\" when confronted.\n\nFirst, I need to assess workplace norms. Nail clipping is generally considered personal grooming, but it can be sensitive in shared workspaces. Some people might find the sound or the act of clipping nails in the office unhygienic or disruptive, especially if it's audible from a distance. However, others might see it as a reasonable thing to do when necessary, especially if it's done in a private area like one's own cubicle.\n\nThe key points here are: the friend clipped a hanging nail, then two more to even them out. The coworker B was visibly upset, both in person and via text. The friend's response was dismissive (\"chill out\"), which might have escalated the tension. The question is whether the act itself is inconsiderate or if coworker B's reaction is overblown.\n\nWorkplace etiquette often hinges on mutual respect. If someone is doing something that affects others negatively (like loud noises or potential mess), it's usually better to do it in a private area or at a time when it's least disruptive. However, the friend was in her own cubicle, so maybe she thought it was acceptable. But the sound traveling 100 feet suggests it's audible to others, which could be a point against her.\n\nOn the other hand, coworker B's reaction seems strong. It's possible that coworker B has a genuine aversion or sensitivity, but reacting with a demand and then sending a text about it might be overreacting. However, the friend's action in clipping three nails might be seen as a bit much, especially if it's in response to the initial complaint.\n\nThe friend's \"chill out\" response could be seen as dismissive, which might make her seem like the asshole because it shows a lack of consideration for coworker B's feelings. But if coworker B's reaction was unreasonable, the friend might not be entirely at fault.\n\nIn many workplaces, the norm is to avoid certain personal grooming tasks at work, including nail clipping, because they can be disruptive or off-putting to others. Even in a cubicle, if the sound is heard by others, it might be considered inconsiderate. The act of clipping more nails after coworker B's complaint could be seen as defiant or thoughtless.\n\nHowever, if the friend had a valid reason (like a hanging nail that's uncomfortable or unsanitary if left) and did it discreetly, it might be more acceptable. But in this case, the act was noticed and complained about, leading to a public confrontation. The friend's response might have been the more harmful part here.\n\nConsidering all this, the balance seems to tip towards the friend being in the wrong. She could have avoided the situation by clipping her nails before or after work, or in a private restroom. Her decision to clip them in the office when it's audible and then continue after being asked might be seen as inconsiderate. The dismissive response also doesn't help her case.\n"
