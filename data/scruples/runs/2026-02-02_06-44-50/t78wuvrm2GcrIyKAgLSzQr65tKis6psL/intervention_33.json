And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about clipping nails at work. The friend did it once, then did two more to even them out. Then coworker B was really upset about it, even from across the office. \n\nFirst, I need to consider office etiquette. Some people might find it gross because of the sound or the mess. But others might think it's a personal thing as long as you're not disturbing others. The friend was in her own cubicle, so maybe not causing direct harm. But Coworker B clearly heard it and was bothered.\n\nThe friend responded with \"chill out,\" which might not have been the best approach. Maybe a more considerate response could have helped, like saying she's sorry if it bothered them. But was the act itself wrong? If there's no specific rule against it, maybe not. However, being considerate is important. If Coworker B is sensitive, maybe the friend should have been more mindful, like doing it in a bathroom or a less public area. But clipping in a cubicle isn't necessarily a big issue unless it's a shared space. \n\nAlso, the friend clipped more after the initial comment, which could mean she was reacting to Coworker B's criticism, maybe as a joke or to show she's not stopping. That might have escalated things. So, whether the friend was an asshole depends on intent and the company's culture. But generally, unless there's a policy, it's a matter of personal opinion. So maybe the friend isn't in the wrong, but perhaps could have handled it better. But the question is if she's in the wrong. Since the act of clipping isn't inherently wrong, maybe the answer is B.\n"
