And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the friend) is the asshole for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that the friend had a hanging nail, clipped it, then clipped two more to even things out. Coworker B was upset because she could hear it from far away and found it disgusting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common workplace norms. Generally, clipping nails at work isn't common because it can be messy and might be seen as unprofessional. However, the friend was in her own cubicle, not a shared space. She did it to fix a hanging nail, which could be considered a personal hygiene issue. But then she clipped two more, which might be seen as going beyond necessity.\n\nCoworker B's reaction is strong\u2014calling it disgusting and hearing it from 100 feet away. The noise could be a problem if it's disturbing others. The friend's response was \"chill out,\" which might come off as dismissive. \n\nOn one hand, the friend is handling a personal matter in a private space. On the other hand, the noise and potential mess could affect others. The key points are: location (own cubicle vs. shared spaces), necessity (fixing a problem vs. unnecessary clipping), and consideration for coworkers' feelings. \n\nWorkplace etiquette often emphasizes being considerate. Even if it's in her cubicle, the noise might still be a disturbance. Clipping more than needed could imply she's not taking it seriously. The friend's response was dismissive, which might escalate the situation.\n\nSo, while the action itself isn't inherently wrong, the context and response might make her the asshole. Answer A (yes) or B (no)? I think it's a bit of both. But since coworker B was the one who first criticized her, maybe the friend isn't entirely wrong. However, the friend's actions did cause a disturbance. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the coworker overreacted. It's a bit of a toss-up. But considering the noise and the response, maybe the friend is partially at fault. I'm leaning towards A, but not sure. Some sources say clipping nails is generally frowned upon in workplaces. So maybe A is correct.\n"
