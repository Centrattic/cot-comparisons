And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author (the friend in the story) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The friend had a hanging nail, clipped it at work when someone overheard. Then, after a colleague complained, she clipped more nails. The coworker found it disgusting and the friend said \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the main issue is whether clipping nails at work is inappropriate. Different people might have different views. Some might think it's gross because it's unsanitary or distracting. Others might see it as a quick fix when you can't do it elsewhere. The friend did it in her cubicle, which is her workspace, so maybe it's reasonable. However, the coworker was bothered by the sound and the act itself. The friend's response was dismissive, which could come off as rude.\n\nWorkplace etiquette often depends on the environment. If the office has specific rules against it, that's a factor. But the story doesn't mention any rules. The friend's actions were in self-defense for a personal hygiene issue. On the other hand, the coworker's sensitivity might be valid if the sound was disturbing. The friend continued after being asked, which could be seen as not respecting the coworker's discomfort.\n\nSo, is the friend the asshole? It's a bit of a gray area. If she had done it discreetly and stopped when asked, maybe not. But continuing after being told it's disturbing might make her the asshole. The answer hinges on whether respecting others' sensitivities is more important than personal convenience. The friend's \"chill out\" response was probably not helpful. So maybe the answer is A (she's wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted. Let me check similar scenarios. In some cases, personal grooming at work is frowned upon, especially if it affects others. So, A might be the right choice here.\n"
