And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author's friend is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend mentions a hanging nail and uses her clippers. Then Coworker B overhears and demands she not do that because it's disgusting. The friend proceeds to clip her nails, and Coworker B texts her again about hearing it from far away and calling it gross. The friend responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nNow, the main question is whether clipping nails at work is an asshole move. I should consider workplace norms and common etiquette. In many offices, eating or doing things like clipping nails in shared spaces might be frowned upon because of hygiene or noise. But the friend is in her own cubicle, so maybe privacy is a factor. However, the noise might still travel, especially in an open office layout.\n\nCoworker B seems particularly sensitive here, using words like \"disgusting\" and \"gross.\" Maybe there's a cultural or personal aversion to that sound. On the other hand, the friend is addressing a medical concern (a hangnail) and trying to fix it. But she did clip more than one to \"even things out,\" which might be unnecessary and could exacerbate the issue.\n\nThe friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, not considering Coworker B's discomfort. Even if the action itself is not inherently wrong, the way it was handled could be. Maybe the friend should have taken it to a private restroom or a less audible area. Also, doing three nails might be seen as overdoing it compared to just fixing a single hangnail.\n\nWorkplace etiquette often values consideration for others. If the action is disruptive or makes others uncomfortable, the employee should adjust their behavior. The key here is whether the friend's actions were considerate. Since Coworker B was within earshot and clearly disturbed, the friend's actions might be inconsiderate despite being in her cubicle.\n\nSo, considering all that, the friend might be in the wrong for causing discomfort to a coworker, even if clipping nails in general isn't a big deal. The response \"chill out\" also doesn't show empathy. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But I should also think if there's any defense. For example, if the friend had no other option and it was a minor action. But the fact that Coworker B was so upset suggests it's a problem, making the answer more likely A.\n"
