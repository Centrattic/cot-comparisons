And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for clipping their nails at work. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the friend mentions a hanging nail and clips it using her clippers. Then she clips two more to even them out. Coworker B overhears, gets upset, and texts her that it's disgusting. The friend responds with \"chill out.\" The main question is whether clipping nails at work is an asshole move.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms and etiquette. In many offices, there are informal rules about certain behaviors. Clipping nails might be seen as unhygienic or distracting to others, especially if done loudly or in common areas. However, it's a personal hygiene task, so some might argue it's acceptable in a private cubicle.\n\nThe friend did it in her own cubicle, which could be seen as reasonable, but clipping multiple nails after a comment from a coworker might be perceived as a reaction or challenge. The coworker's reaction seems strong\u2014calling it disgusting and hearing it from 100 feet away. The friend's response of \"chill out\" could be seen as dismissive, which might escalate tensions.\n\nWorkplace etiquette often values consideration for others. Even if the action itself isn't inherently wrong, the way it's done and the response to feedback matter. If the friend continued after being asked, that could be seen as inconsiderate. But if she was merely addressing a hygiene issue in her own space, maybe not. The key factors are location (private cubicle vs. common area), volume (loud clippers), and the response to criticism.\n\nIn some workplaces, nail clipping is frowned upon because of the noise and potential spread of debris. However, if done quietly and discreetly, it might be acceptable. The coworker's strong reaction suggests that this workplace has a sensitivity to such actions. The friend's decision to clip more nails after the initial comment might be seen as provoking, especially if it was a direct response.\n\nThe answer hinges on balancing personal needs with workplace respect. If the friend acted in a way that disregarded her coworker's comfort, even if in her own space, she could be at fault. Alternatively, if it's a reasonable personal task done discreetly, she's not. Since the coworker heard it from far away and found it disgusting, the actions might have been disruptive. The friend's dismissive reply doesn't help. So, leaning towards A (yes, she's at fault) because she continued after being told and didn't consider the coworker's feelings adequately.\n"
