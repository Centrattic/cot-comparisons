And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The scenario involves Coworker B being upset and confronting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Clipping nails at work isn't uncommon, but it can be a point of contention. Some people find it gross because of the sound or the potential for debris. The friend had a hanging nail, which might be seen as a practical reason to clip it. However, doing so in the cubicle where others can hear could be problematic if it's distracting or makes others uncomfortable.\n\nCoworker B heard her from 100 feet away, which suggests it was loud. The friend then clipped more nails after the first incident, possibly escalating the situation. The response \"chill out\" might not be the best way to address someone's discomfort, even if the friend didn't mean to be disruptive.\n\nHowever, Coworker B's reaction seems over the top. Demanding someone not to clip nails might be overly sensitive. The friend was in her own cubicle, so maybe she had a right to take care of her personal grooming there. But balancing both perspectives, the key points are: was it reasonable to clip nails in a shared workspace, and did the friend consider others' feelings?\n\nThe friend might not be in the wrong if she did it quickly and in her own space, but the additional clipping after being asked could be seen as dismissive. However, Coworker B's initial demand was abrupt. Maybe a middle ground is that the friend could have moved to a private area or done it quietly, but the office environment might not always allow that. Since the friend was in her cubicle, it's a semi-private space, so maybe it's acceptable. But the sound being heard from far away might indicate it was disruptive. I'm leaning towards the friend not being the asshole, but the answer depends on balancing both sides. The friend's actions were practical but might have been inconsiderate. Coworker B was overly sensitive. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
