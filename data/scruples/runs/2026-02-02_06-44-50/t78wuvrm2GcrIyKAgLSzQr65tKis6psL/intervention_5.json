And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author (the friend who clipped her nails at work) is in the wrong. The story says that the friend mentioned having a hanging nail and used clipper. Then coworker B overheard, confronted her, and told her not to clip there. The friend clipped it and even did two more to even it out. Then coworker B texts her, upset about hearing it from far away. The friend replied \"chill out\".\n\nHmm. The key points here are about workplace etiquette. Clipping nails at work can be seen as unprofessional or distracting. It might also be a hygiene concern, depending on the workplace's policies. The friend clipped not just the hanging one but two more, which could be seen as overdoing it. Then responding with \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive.\n\nBut work environments vary. Some places might be more relaxed, others not. If the friend was in a cubicle, maybe it's a private space? But coworker B could still hear from 100 feet away, so maybe the noise was an issue. The friend's actions led to more confrontation. The response \"chill out\" might not help defuse the situation. \n\nIs it the friend's fault for clipping nails? It depends on company policy. If there's no rule against it, maybe not. But if it's a shared space, noise and cleanliness matter. Clipping nails can create noise and debris, which might bother others. The friend might not have considered that. Also, adding two more nails after the initial one could be seen as unnecessary. \n\nBut coworker B was confrontational and then sent a text, which could be seen as overreacting. However, the friend's actions did cause discomfort. So maybe the friend is partially at fault. The question is whether it's the friend's fault. If the workplace doesn't have a policy, maybe it's not the friend's fault. But in a general sense, maintaining a respectful workspace is important. Clipping nails can be distracting. So maybe the answer is yes, the friend is in the wrong.\n"
