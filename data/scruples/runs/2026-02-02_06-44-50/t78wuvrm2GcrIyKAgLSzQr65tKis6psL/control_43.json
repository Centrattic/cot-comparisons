And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation involves coworker B getting upset and confronting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common workplace norms. Clipping nails isn't typically something people do in public, but maybe in a private space like a cubicle? If someone has a long nail that's causing issues, maybe it's a quick fix. However, the sound might bother others, especially if it's audible from a distance. \n\nCoworker B overheard the initial comment, then confronted the friend. The friend clipped more nails after, which led to the coworker sending a text about hearing it from far away. The friend's response was \"chill out,\" which might come off as dismissive. \n\nIs it gross? Some people might find the sound of nail clippers unpleasant. It's subjective, but in shared workspaces, loud noises or personal grooming can be disruptive. On the other hand, the friend was in her own cubicle, so maybe she felt it was her right to do it there. But if it's bothering others, maybe she should avoid doing it during work hours or use a private area.\n\nThe key points are: the action itself (clipping nails), the location (own cubicle), the reaction of coworker B, and the friend's response. The debate is between personal convenience vs. others' comfort. \n\nI think it's a judgment call. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she's in her space, but she might have been inconsiderate. However, since coworker B was overly aggressive and the friend's response was dismissive, maybe the friend isn't the asshole. But the act itself could be seen as unprofessional. Hmm. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong, but it's close.\n"
