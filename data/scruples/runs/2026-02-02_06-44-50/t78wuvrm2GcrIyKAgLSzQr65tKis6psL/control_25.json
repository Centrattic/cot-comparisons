And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (the friend who clipped nails) is the asshole. The scenario involves her clipping her nails at work after a coworker (B) told her not to because it's gross. The friend then clips more nails to \"even things out\" and responds with \"chill out\" when criticized further.\n\nFirst, consider the workplace etiquette. Clipping nails can be a personal hygiene issue. Some people might find it unpleasant to hear the sound or see someone doing it. However, if the friend did it in her own cubicle, not in a shared space, maybe it's reasonable. But Coworker B heard her from 100 feet away, which suggests the noise was noticeable. That might be an issue because it could disturb others, even if she's in her own space. \n\nThen there's the response \"chill out\" which could be seen as dismissive or rude. The friend clipped three nails after being told not to, which Coworker B found excessive. The friend's actions after being asked to stop might be problematic. If the office has a policy against such actions, that's a factor. But if it's just a personal preference of Coworker B, the friend might not be wrong. However, creating a disturbance, even unintentionally, could make the friend at fault. The key points are: location of the action (private cubicle vs. shared space), noise level disturbing others, and the friend's reaction. If the friend was respectful and did it quietly, maybe not wrong. But since the noise was a problem and she continued, maybe she is. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards A if the action genuinely bothered others despite being in her own space.\n"
