And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation involves some workplace etiquette.\n\nFirst, the friend mentions having a hanging nail and clips it. Then, after a coworker objects, she clips more nails and gets criticized again. The coworker is really upset, saying it's disgusting and audible from far away. The friend responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nHmm. In an office setting, people might have different sensitivities. Some might find nail clipping disruptive or unhygienic. But others might see it as a minor, necessary grooming task. The key points here are the context and the reaction.\n\nThe friend was in her own cubicle, so maybe it's a private space. However, the act of clipping nails can create noise, which might disturb others, especially if the cubicle walls are low. The coworker heard it from 100 feet away, which suggests it's a noisy environment or maybe the cubicles aren't soundproofed. That could be an issue.\n\nAlso, the friend clipped more nails after the initial complaint. That might escalate the problem, as it shows she continued the behavior despite knowing it bothered someone. But maybe she felt it was necessary to fix her nails.\n\nWorkplace etiquette often depends on company norms. If there's no explicit rule against it, it's a bit subjective. However, the coworker's strong reaction and the audible nature of the clippers might make it a problem. The friend's response of \"chill out\" could come off as dismissive, which isn't ideal. It's better to acknowledge concerns and adjust behavior if needed.\n\nSo, whether she's in the wrong depends on balancing both sides. The act itself isn't inherently wrong, but the context and the follow-up actions matter. Since she continued after being told, and the environment is such that it's heard from far away, maybe she should have been more considerate. But it's a judgment call. The answer might lean towards her not being the asshole, but the question is if she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nConsidering the details, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. Nail clipping is a personal hygiene task, and if done in a private space, it's reasonable unless there's a specific policy against it. The coworker's reaction is about noise and personal preference, but the author's actions were within her rights unless there's a rule. The \"chill out\" response might be rude, but the act itself isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
