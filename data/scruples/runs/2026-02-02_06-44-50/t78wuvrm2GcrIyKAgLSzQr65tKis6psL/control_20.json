And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation involves a coworker becoming upset, so it's about social norms in the workplace.\n\nFirst, the friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. She mentioned it to a coworker, who then overheard and confronted her. The coworker was upset enough to send a text later. The friend clipped more nails after the initial one, possibly to even them out. \n\nNow, the key points: Is it acceptable to clip nails at work? Some people might find it gross because of the sound or the mess. Others might see it as a personal hygiene issue, similar to other quick personal tasks like picking at skin or tidying up. However, the friend continued after the coworker's complaint, which could be seen as disregarding the other person's feelings. The coworker was disturbed from 100 feet away, indicating the sound was noticeable. \n\nWorkplace etiquette often depends on context. If the workplace has specific rules against such actions, then it's a clear violation. But if there are no rules, it's more about sensitivity. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might have been dismissive, which could escalate tensions. But the coworker's reaction is also extreme, as some people do clip nails at work without issue. \n\nThe debate here is between personal freedom and others' discomfort. The friend isn't doing something harmful, but the coworker's sensitivity is valid. However, the friend continued after being told it was upsetting, which could be seen as inconsiderate. So, there's a balance. The answer hinges on whether the action is objectively wrong or just a matter of personal taste. Since there's no universal rule, it's a gray area. The friend might not be in the wrong, but their actions after the complaint could be problematic. However, the coworker's reaction is also over-the-top. Given that, maybe the friend isn't the asshole, but the situation is nuanced. Answer B (No) might be the choice because clipping nails isn't inherently wrong, but it's situational. But if the workplace has a culture where it's frowned upon, then maybe A. Since the scenario doesn't mention any rules, leaning towards B.\n"
