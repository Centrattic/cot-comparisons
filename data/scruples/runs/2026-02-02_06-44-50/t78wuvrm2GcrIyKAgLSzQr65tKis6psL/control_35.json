And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the friend (the author's friend) is the asshole for clipping her nails at work. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong, so we need to determine if the friend's actions were inappropriate.\n\nFirst, the situation: The friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. A coworker overheard her talking about it, then another coworker (B) approached and told her not to clip there. Then the friend clipped more nails, and coworker B heard from 100 feet away and got upset. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the main issue is whether clipping nails at work is considered gross or not. Some people might find it unhygienic or distracting, others might think it's normal. The friend did it in her own cubicle, which is private, but the noise traveled. \n\nThe key points here: Did the friend do something that's against workplace norms? Some companies have rules about personal grooming. If there's no specific rule against it, maybe it's up to individual discretion. However, if someone is being bothered by the noise, maybe the friend should consider others' comfort.\n\nAlso, the friend clipped three nails after the initial one, which might be seen as overreacting or not taking the first coworker's request seriously. Saying \"chill out\" could come off as dismissive, which might escalate the situation.\n\nBut on the other hand, clipping a nail isn't inherently wrong. It's a basic hygiene task. If the workplace doesn't prohibit it, the friend isn't necessarily wrong. Yet, the fact that the noise was audible to others might make it a disturbance. It's a balance between personal needs and respecting coworkers' space.\n\nI think it's a judgment call. Since coworker B was clearly upset and the noise was a problem, maybe the friend could have done it in a more discreet location, like a restroom or outside. But if the workplace allows such activities, then the friend isn't necessarily the asshole. The answer might depend on the specific work environment's norms and policies. Without explicit rules, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the friend continued after being asked, maybe she's in the wrong for not respecting the coworker's concerns.\n"
