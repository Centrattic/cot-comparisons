And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (my friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The user thinks she is, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, the scenario: Friend mentions a hanging nail and uses clippers. Coworker B overhears, confronts her, says it's disgusting. Friend then clips more nails and gets a text from B complaining about the noise and calling it gross. Friend responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the key points are: the act of clipping nails at work, the confrontation, and the response. \n\nWorkplace etiquette often depends on company policies and cultural norms. If there's no specific rule against it, maybe it's allowed. However, some people might find it disruptive or unhygienic. The noise could be an issue if it's disturbing others. Also, the fact that Coworker B was offended and the friend clipped more nails after the confrontation might show a lack of consideration.\n\nBut the friend's actions were in her own cubicle, which is a private space. However, the sound carrying across 100 feet suggests it's audible in shared areas. Maybe the friend didn't consider that. The response \"chill out\" could be seen as dismissive, not taking the coworker's feelings into account.\n\nOn the other hand, clipping a nail to avoid injury isn't unreasonable. If it's a one-time thing, maybe it's not a big deal. But doing more after being told might escalate the issue. The debate is about whether it's gross or just normal behavior.\n\nIn terms of being the asshole, if the friend acted without considering others' sensitivities and then dismissed their concerns, that could make her the asshole. But if the coworker is overly sensitive and there's no policy against it, maybe not. However, the fact that the friend continued after being told and then dismissed the complaint leans towards her being in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
