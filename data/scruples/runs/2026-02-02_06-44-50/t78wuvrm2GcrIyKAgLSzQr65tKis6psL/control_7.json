And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about clipping nails at work. The friend noticed a hanging nail and used clippers, then the coworker overheard and confronted her, saying it was disgusting. The friend clipped more nails and got another text from the coworker. Then the friend said \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, is clipping nails at work acceptable? Some people might find it gross because of the sound or the mess. But others see it as a quick fix for a minor issue. The friend did it in her own cubicle, so maybe it's not disruptive if done quietly. However, the coworker was clearly bothered by it, even from a distance. The friend then clipped two more, which could come off as defiant or dismissive. \n\nThe key points are: the location (private cubicle?), the noise level (could be heard 100 feet away?), and the response to the coworker. If the cubicle is soundproof enough, maybe the noise isn't an issue. But if the sound travels a lot, that's a problem. Also, responding with \"chill out\" might be seen as unprofessional or dismissive. The friend's actions after being confronted might have escalated the situation. \n\nWorkplace etiquette varies, but generally, if an action is bothering others, it's best to avoid it. The coworker's reaction is strong, but maybe overblown. The friend's initial action was minor, but continuing after being told might be the issue. So, is the friend the asshole? Possibly, because they didn't consider the coworker's feelings after being informed. But if the coworker is being overly sensitive, maybe not. It's a bit of a gray area. However, since the question is if the author is in the wrong, and the friend did clip nails in her cubicle and responded dismissively, maybe A (Yes) is the answer. Or B (No) if it's considered a minor issue. Hmm. Need to decide based on typical social norms. Usually, clipping nails at work is frowned upon because of the noise and perceived messiness. The friend's response was also dismissive. So likely A.\n"
