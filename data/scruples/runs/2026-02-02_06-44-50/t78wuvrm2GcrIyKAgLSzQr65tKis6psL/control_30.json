And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the friend) is the asshole for clipping her nails at work. So, the situation is that she had a hanging nail and used clippers. Then coworker B got upset, told her not to do it, and later sent a text about hearing the clipping from far away and finding it disgusting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider office etiquette. Clipping nails at work is a common topic of debate. Some people might find it gross because of the noise or the idea of doing it in a shared space. Others might think it's practical if you need to fix a split nail urgently. \n\nThe friend clipped a hanging nail, which seems like a quick fix. But then she clipped two more to \"even things out,\" which might have been the catalyst for coworker B's reaction. Clipping multiple nails could be seen as unnecessary and more disruptive. \n\nCoworker B's reaction was pretty strong. She went into the cubicle to demand she stop, then later texted her about the noise. The friend responded with \"chill out,\" which might have come off as dismissive. That could have escalated the situation.\n\nNow, is the friend in the wrong? Well, if the workplace has policies against certain activities during work hours, maybe. But the story doesn't mention any rules. However, common courtesy suggests that actions which disturb others (like noisy activities) might be frowned upon. Even if it's not a policy violation, causing discomfort to colleagues could be an issue.\n\nThe friend's actions were in her own cubicle, so maybe she wasn't in a common area. But the sound traveled, which coworker B found disturbing. The friend's response to \"chill out\" might not be the best way to handle a colleague's discomfort. It could be seen as not respecting their feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, clipping a split nail could be seen as necessary for personal hygiene. However, doing it in a way that's disruptive (like multiple clippings) and then not acknowledging the coworker's concern might tip the balance.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the coworker's strong reaction and the friend's response. The friend might be in the wrong for not considering the coworker's feelings and for responding dismissively. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes). But if the friend's actions were necessary and the coworker is overly sensitive, then B. Hmm.\n"
