And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the friend who clipped her nails at work is in the wrong. So first, the friend had a hanging nail and used clippers to fix it. Coworker B overheard her comment and then confronted her, saying not to clip nails at work because it's gross. Then the friend clipped more nails to \"even things out,\" which might have been a reaction to the confrontation. After that, Coworker B texted her again, upset because she could hear the clipping from far away and found it disgusting.\n\nNow, the main points here are about workplace appropriateness and personal boundaries. Clipping nails at work isn't inherently wrong, but it can be seen as unhygienic or inconsiderate depending on the environment. The key factors are whether the friend was in a shared space where others could be disturbed. If she was in her own cubicle, maybe it's more acceptable, but the sound traveling 100 feet suggests it's a large office, and others might be affected. Also, the friend clipped more nails after the initial incident, which could be seen as provoking the situation further. The response \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, not taking Coworker B's discomfort seriously. \n\nWorkplace norms vary, but generally, tasks that involve bodily functions or might be considered unclean are usually done in private. Clipping nails can create noise and debris, which might be off-putting in a professional setting. The fact that Coworker B was specifically disturbed and felt the need to message her again shows that the friend's actions were indeed affecting others. Even if the friend's cubicle is private, the noise carries, so maybe she should have been more considerate of others' sensitivities. Alternatively, if the company has no specific rules against it, it's a judgment call. But the friend's reaction to the confrontation might indicate a lack of empathy towards Coworker B's feelings. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the actions crossed the line from personal hygiene to disrupting others. Since the friend continued clipping after being told to stop, it's likely that she was in the wrong. Therefore, the author (the friend) is the asshole, which would be answer A.\n"
