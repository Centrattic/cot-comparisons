And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Alright, let's tackle this. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. \n\nFirst, the situation: The friend mentions a hanging nail and uses clippers. Coworker B overhears, confronts her, saying it's disgusting. The friend then clips more nails, and later gets a text from Coworker B about hearing the noise from far away. The friend responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, is this an asshole move? Let's consider office etiquette. Generally, clipping nails at work isn't a huge deal unless it's disruptive. The key points here are that Coworker B was offended, found it disgusting, and was disturbed by the noise. The friend continued clipping after being told, which might be seen as dismissive. \n\nOn one hand, people might clip nails at work if they need to. On the other, if it's bothering others, especially after being asked to stop, it could be considered inconsiderate. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as defensive or not taking Coworker B's feelings seriously. \n\nWorkplace norms vary, but common courtesy usually involves being mindful of others' comfort. If the act is causing discomfort, even if it's a minor thing like nail clipping, it's better to adjust. The friend continued after being asked, which escalated the issue. \n\nSo, the friend might be in the wrong for not respecting Coworker B's feelings and continuing the action. But maybe Coworker B overreacted. However, given that the friend was told to stop and then did it anyway, that's probably the main issue here. Therefore, the answer leans towards A.\n"
