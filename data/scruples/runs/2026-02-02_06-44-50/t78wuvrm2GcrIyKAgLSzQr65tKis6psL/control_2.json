And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend had a hanging nail, which might be uncomfortable or unsightly. She mentioned it to a coworker, who overheard. Then Coworker B confronts her, telling her not to clip nails at work because it's disgusting. The friend then clips her nail and two more to even them out. Coworker B heard the clippers from 100 feet away and got upset again, calling it gross. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the main question is whether clipping nails at work is an asshole move. Let me consider both sides.\n\nFrom the friend's perspective, she had a practical need (fixing a hanging nail). Clipping nails in her own cubicle might be seen as reasonable, especially if she's trying to maintain her appearance. She might argue that it's a quick task and necessary. The fact that she did it in her cubicle suggests she's not being inconsiderate, just handling a personal hygiene issue.\n\nOn the other hand, Coworker B found it disgusting. The noise might be an issue, especially if it's audible from a distance. Some people might find the sound of clippers unpleasant. Also, there's a workplace etiquette aspect. Some companies have rules about personal grooming during work hours to maintain professionalism. If the company doesn't have such rules, it's more about social norms. However, if the act is causing a disturbance (like the noise being heard far away), it could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nThe friend's response of \"chill out\" might have come off as dismissive. Even if she's in the right, responding in that way could escalate the conflict. But the main issue is whether the act itself is wrong.\n\nI need to check if there are general guidelines about this. In many workplaces, personal grooming is usually done in restrooms or during breaks. Clipping nails at your desk might be seen as unprofessional or unsanitary. However, if it's a quick fix and done in a private area (cubicle), some might argue it's acceptable. The key points are noise and the perception of unprofessionalism.\n\nSince Coworker B was clearly disturbed, even though it's in a cubicle, the noise and the act itself might be enough for some to consider it inappropriate. The fact that the friend clipped three nails might be seen as unnecessary, especially if one was just to fix a hangnail. Clipping multiple nails could be interpreted as taking more time than needed, thus being more disruptive.\n\nSo, depending on the workplace culture, the friend might be in the wrong. If the workplace values discretion and avoiding disturbances, then yes. But if it's a more casual environment, maybe not. However, since the coworker felt strongly enough to message her, it's a valid concern. The friend's actions, while practical, may have been inconsiderate of others' sensitivities. The response of \"chill out\" also shows a lack of consideration for the coworker's feelings, which could tip the scales.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's a common debate, the friend's actions could be seen as inconsiderate, making her the asshole in this situation. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong)."
