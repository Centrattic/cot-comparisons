And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that her coworker heard her and found it disgusting. The friend clipped her nails after a comment about a hanging nail and then did more to even them out, leading to a complaint from coworker B.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Clipping nails can be a personal grooming task. Some people might do it at work if they don't have time otherwise, but others might find it unhygienic or distracting. The friend did it in her cubicle, which is a private space, but the sound carried, which coworker B found upsetting.\n\nIs it acceptable to do personal grooming tasks like clipping nails at work? It depends on company policies and cultural norms. If there's no policy against it, it's more a matter of common courtesy. However, doing something that's audible and might disturb others could be an issue. The friend did it after being told not to by coworker B, which complicates things. She ignored the initial demand, then continued, leading to more complaints.\n\nThe response \"chill out\" from the friend might come off as dismissive. Even if the friend felt it was her right, responding to a complaint with that could be seen as insensitive. The coworker B was clearly upset, so the friend's reaction might have escalated the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, clipping a hanging nail could be seen as necessary for comfort. However, doing it in a way that affects others might be inconsiderate. The friend might not be the asshole, but there's a case to be made that she was inconsiderate of her coworker's feelings.\n\nI need to balance both sides. The key points are: the act itself (clipping nails in a private space), the reaction of the coworker (hearing it from far away and finding it gross), and the friend's response. If the company doesn't have a policy against it, maybe it's not wrong, but the friend could have been more considerate by doing it in a more discreet time or place, or handling the complaint more gracefully. Since the friend was clipping to fix a problem and then did more, the initial act might be justified, but the follow-up actions and response might be the issue. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, but there's room for both sides. However, the fact that coworker B found it gross and the friend didn't take it seriously might tip it towards A. Hmm.\n"
