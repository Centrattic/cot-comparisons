And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The scenario is that the friend had a hanging nail, used clippers, and then clipped two more to even them out. Coworker B got upset, saying it was disgusting, and the friend responded with \"chill out.\" The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, clipping nails in the workplace can be seen as unhygienic or disruptive. Some people might find the sound annoying or the act itself gross. Workplace etiquette often discourages such activities because they can be distracting or create a negative environment for others. Coworker B's reaction is valid in the sense that personal grooming in public spaces can be a concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend was dealing with an immediate issue (a hanging nail), which might be uncomfortable or even painful. She did it in her cubicle, which is a semi-private space. The act itself is quick and necessary. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, but it could also be her way of defending her right to handle a personal matter. \n\nHowever, the key point here is the workplace setting. Even if the action is necessary, doing it in a shared space where others might be disturbed could be considered inconsiderate. The fact that Coworker B could hear her from over 100 feet away suggests the noise was significant. Repeated clipping after the initial fix might not be necessary and could be seen as provocative.\n\nThe friend's decision to clip more nails after the initial fix might have been an overreaction, especially if she was aware of Coworker B's sensitivity. The response \"chill out\" is dismissive and doesn't acknowledge the coworker's feelings. This could escalate the tension.\n\nWorkplace etiquette usually advises being mindful of others' comfort. Even if the action is technically acceptable, the way it's done matters. The friend's actions and response might not be the worst, but they do contribute to a negative interaction. So, the friend isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in handling the situation more sensitively.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong, but there are nuances. However, given the options A and B as per the user's instructions, the friend's actions, while not ideal, are justified under the circumstances, so the answer is B.\n"
