And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for clipping their nails at work. The situation involves a friend who clipped a hanging nail, then clipped two more after being reprimanded by a coworker. The coworker found it disgusting and spread the complaint via text.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend was in her own cubicle when she clipped the nails. The coworker overheard and confronted her, then later sent a text about it. The friend responded with \"chill out.\" \n\nNow, the key points are: Is clipping nails at work inherently gross or inappropriate? It depends on the workplace culture and policies. Some places might consider it acceptable if done discreetly, while others might find it unprofessional. The friend was in her cubicle, which might be considered a semi-private space, but the sound carried over 100 feet, which could be disturbing in a shared office environment.\n\nThe friend clipped an extra two nails after the initial one, possibly to even things out. This could be seen as a reaction to being scolded, but maybe she felt the need to address the situation. However, continuing the action after being asked to stop might be seen as defiant.\n\nCoworker B's reaction is about noise and perceived grossness. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive or not taking the coworker's discomfort seriously. However, the coworker's reaction is also over-the-top in some opinions, as clipping nails isn't inherently harmful. \n\nWorkplace etiquette can vary. If the company has no specific rules against it, the friend might not be wrong. But if it's a shared space and the action is disruptive, even if not physically, the friend might be at fault. The fact that the coworker heard it from afar suggests it was loud or frequent. The friend's actions could be seen as inconsiderate if they knew it was bothering others. \n\nIn summary, the author's actions might be considered inconsiderate in a shared workspace, especially after being explicitly told not to. However, if the action isn't against company policy and done in a private cubicle, it could be seen as the coworker overreacting. The answer hinges on workplace norms and the specific circumstances of disruption. Since the friend continued after being asked to stop, which could be seen as disregarding the coworker's feelings, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
