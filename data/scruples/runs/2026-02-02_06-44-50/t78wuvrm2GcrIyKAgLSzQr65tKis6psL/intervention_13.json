And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone clipping their nails at work and a coworker getting upset. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The friend clipped a hanging nail, mentioned it to a coworker, and then Coworker B overheard. Coworker B came in and told the friend not to do it because it's disgusting. Then the friend clipped more nails to even them out. Coworker B heard from 100 feet away and called it gross. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the question is whether clipping nails at work is an asshole move. The friend is the one doing it, Coworker B is the one getting upset. The friend's defense is that it's just clipping a hanging nail, which might be necessary for comfort or hygiene. On the other hand, Coworker B finds it disgusting, possibly because of the sound or the mess. \n\nI need to consider workplace norms. Some people might find clipping nails in the office off-putting because it's not typically done in shared spaces. It could create noise or debris, which might bother others. However, if the person is doing it quickly and without making a mess, maybe it's acceptable. The friend's action of clipping more after being told off might escalate the situation. \n\nAlso, the friend's response of \"chill out\" after the coworker expressed discomfort could be seen as dismissive. That might not help the situation. The coworker's reaction is about how they feel, and the friend's response doesn't acknowledge that. \n\nBut then, is the friend wrong for doing something that's not harmful? If the workplace doesn't have a specific rule against it, maybe it's a matter of personal preference. However, considering others' comfort is important in a shared workspace. \n\nSo, balancing both perspectives: the friend had a legitimate need to clip a hanging nail, but the coworker's discomfort is valid too. Maybe the friend could have done it in a more discreet manner, like in a private space if possible. Clipping more after being told might have been unnecessary. \n\nIn terms of who's the asshole, it's a bit of a gray area. The friend isn't doing anything objectively wrong, but they might not be considering coworkers' feelings enough. The coworker is being overly sensitive but has a right to their opinion. The friend's response was dismissive, which isn't helpful. \n\nI think the friend might be in the wrong because while clipping a nail isn't inherently bad, the way they handled the interaction and continued after the coworker's complaint could be seen as not respecting others' feelings. So answer A.\n"
