And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (the friend) is the asshole for clipping her nails at work.\n\nFirst, the scenario: She mentions having a hanging nail and clips it. Then, the coworker overheard her talking about it and went to demand she not do it. The friend then clips two more nails to even things out. The coworker texts her that she can hear it from 100 feet away and finds it disgusting. The friend responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the key points here are about workplace etiquette and how the situation escalated. Clipping nails at work isn't inherently wrong, but it can be a matter of company policy or personal discretion. The friend's initial action might be seen as reasonable if there's no policy against it. However, the coworker's reaction shows that the noise and the act itself are bothering others.\n\nThe friend's response after being confronted is dismissive. Saying \"chill out\" could come off as disrespectful or not taking the coworker's feelings seriously. Even if the friend didn't think she was doing anything wrong, her reaction might have been the bigger issue here. The coworker was clearly disturbed by the noise and the act, and the friend's response didn't acknowledge that.\n\nAlso, the act of clipping multiple nails after the first incident could be seen as provocative, especially if it was in response to the coworker's complaint. It might be perceived as mocking or escalating the situation unnecessarily.\n\nWorkplace norms vary, but generally, maintaining a considerate environment is important. If an action is disruptive to others, even if it's not explicitly prohibited, it's courteous to be mindful and maybe do it in a more private setting or at a time when it's less disruptive. The friend might have overstepped by continuing the action after being told it's an issue and then responding in a dismissive way.\n\nSo, considering both the action and the response, the friend might be in the wrong for not respecting the coworker's discomfort and for escalating the situation with her reply.\n"
