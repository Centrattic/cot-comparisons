And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about clipping nails at work. The friend clipped a hanging nail and then two more to even them out. Coworker B was really upset about it, called it disgusting, and even heard the clippers from far away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the work environment norms. Clipping nails at work isn't something I've seen people do often. Usually, people might do it in a break room or at home to avoid bothering others. The act of clipping nails can be noisy and some people might find it gross, especially in an open office where sounds carry. \n\nCoworker B's reaction seems strong\u2014demanding the friend not to clip nails and then sending a text about it. But the friend continued clipping after that, which might have escalated the issue. The friend's response of \"chill out\" could be seen as dismissive, not considering Coworker B's feelings. \n\nHowever, the friend did it in her own cubicle, so maybe she wasn't in a shared space. But the noise and the act of clipping might still disturb others. Companies often have policies about workplace conduct and respect for others. If the friend knew that coworker was bothered, continuing might be inconsiderate. \n\nOn the other hand, clipping a nail isn't inherently offensive, but doing it in a way that affects others might be. The key points are respect for coworkers' feelings and company policies. If there's no explicit rule against it, but the action is causing distress, it's a judgment call. \n\nSo, is the friend the asshole? It's a balance between personal needs and workplace etiquette. The friend might not be in the wrong if there's no rule against it, but her actions did affect a coworker negatively. Maybe she should have chosen a different time or place. Since she continued after being asked, that's probably where the issue lies. So the answer might be A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because she disregarded the coworker's feelings after being informed.\n"
