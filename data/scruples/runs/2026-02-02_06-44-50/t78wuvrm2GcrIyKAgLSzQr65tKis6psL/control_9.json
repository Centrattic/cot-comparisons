And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a friend clipping their nails at work, which led to a conflict with a coworker. The user is asking if the author (the friend) is the asshole here. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend had a hanging nail and used clippers to fix it. That's understandable, but Coworker B overheard the comment and then directly told her not to do it, calling it disgusting. The friend then clipped two more nails to \"even things out,\" which seems like a reaction to the initial criticism. After that, Coworker B texts the friend again, upset about hearing the nail clippers from far away.\n\nSo, is clipping nails at work inherently wrong? It's a common practice, but it can depend on workplace norms. Some people might find the sound annoying or the act unhygienic, but others don't see an issue. The key points here are: 1) Did the friend do something that's against company policy? The text doesn't mention any policy against it. 2) Was the friend being considerate? She clipped in her cubicle, not in common areas, which is more considerate. However, she did it after being told to stop, which might be less considerate. \n\nCoworker B's reaction seems over the top, especially after the friend already addressed the initial issue. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, but maybe she felt justified since she was in her own space. The main question is whether the friend is in the wrong. Since there's no policy violation, and she tried to adjust by doing it in her cubicle, it's more about personal preferences. The friend isn't necessarily wrong, but Coworker B's hypersensitivity is part of the issue. So, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
