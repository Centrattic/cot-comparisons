And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is about a coworker getting upset and the friend responding by clipping more nails and then saying \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms and etiquette. Clipping nails at work isn't unheard of, but it can be a sensitive topic. Some people might find it gross because of the noise or the visual aspect. The key points here are: the friend clipped a hanging nail, then clipped two more to \"even things out,\" and then received a complaint. \n\nThe coworker was offended, saying it's disgusting and heard from 100 feet away. The friend's response was dismissive. Now, is the friend the asshole? Well, maybe not necessarily. Having a hangnail is uncomfortable, and clipping it quickly might be necessary. However, doing it in a public space where others can hear and be disturbed could be an issue. The friend did it in her own cubicle, which is a bit private, but cubicles aren't soundproof. \n\nBut then, she clipped two more after the initial one. That might have been unnecessary once the initial problem was fixed. Also, her response of \"chill out\" could come off as dismissive, which might escalate the situation. \n\nWorkplace policies might play a role here. If the workplace doesn't have a rule against it, then it's more a matter of social norms. Some people are more sensitive to such things. But if the friend was doing it briefly and in her own space, maybe it's acceptable. On the other hand, if it's causing a disturbance, maybe she should find another time or place.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The initial act might be okay, but clipping more after being complained about and then responding dismissively could tip the scale. The key is whether her actions were reasonable and considerate. If she continued after the coworker was upset, that shows a lack of consideration. So maybe answer A, yes, she's in the wrong.\n"
