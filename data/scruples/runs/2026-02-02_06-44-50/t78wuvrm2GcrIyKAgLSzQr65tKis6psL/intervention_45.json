And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation starts with her having a hanging nail, which she trims because she has clippers. Then Coworker B overhears the comment, confronts her, and later gets upset about the sound of the clippers from 100 feet away. The friend responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Clipping nails at work isn't unheard of, but it can be a point of contention. Some people find the sound of clippers disturbing, which Coworker B clearly does. But is that a valid reason to scold someone? The friend did it in her own cubicle, so maybe she's within her rights. However, if Coworker B is in a different cubicle and the noise is bothering her, maybe the friend should have been more considerate.\n\nThen there's the escalation. After Coworker B's initial confrontation, the friend trims two more nails to \"even things out.\" That seems like a reaction, possibly to Coworker B's criticism, which might not be the best approach. The friend's response of \"chill out\" after receiving another complaint shows a dismissive attitude, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nWorkplace etiquette often involves being mindful of others' sensitivities. Even if the act itself isn't inherently wrong, causing discomfort through noise and then responding dismissively might make the friend the asshole. However, Coworker B's reaction seems over the top too. The key is whether the friend acted unreasonably. Clipping a hangnail in a private cubicle is one thing, but doing more after being told it's bothering someone else might cross a line. So, the answer could hinge on whether the friend was aware of the disturbance and continued without regard. In that case, A (the author is in the wrong) might be justified. But if Coworker B is being overly sensitive, then B (not in the wrong). But given the friend's response and the escalation, A seems more likely.\n"
