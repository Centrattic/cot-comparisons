And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about whether clipping nails at work is considered an asshole move. The friend clipped her nail because there was a hanging one, then did more to even it out. Coworker B was really upset, even hearing it from far away and calling it disgusting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If there's no rule against it, maybe it's allowed. But some workplaces have rules about personal grooming during work hours. If there's no policy, then maybe it's up to social norms.\n\nNext, the context. Clipping nails can create noise that's annoying, especially in an open office. Coworker B was disturbed enough to confront the friend. The friend then continued clipping, possibly making the situation worse by doing more nails. The response of \"chill out\" might have been dismissive and not addressing Coworker B's discomfort.\n\nAlso, hygiene and social etiquette. Some people find nail clipping gross because of the sound or debris. Even if it's hygienic, the act in a shared workspace might be seen as inconsiderate. The friend's actions might have been inconsiderate of others' sensitivities.\n\nBut on the other hand, taking care of personal grooming is necessary. If someone has a long nail that could cause injury, clipping it might be necessary. However, doing it in a public space where it's audible could be an issue.\n\nThe key points are: company policy, noise disturbance, respect for coworkers' feelings, and the response to the complaint. If the friend had done it in a private area or during a break, it might be less of an issue. Since she did it in her cubicle and continued after being told to stop, it's more about being inconsiderate. The friend's response was dismissive, which could escalate tensions.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the friend might be at fault for not considering coworkers' reactions and continuing despite the complaint. The answer is likely A.\n"
