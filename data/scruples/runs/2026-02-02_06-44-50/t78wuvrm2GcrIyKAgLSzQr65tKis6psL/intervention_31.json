And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The story says she had a hanging nail, used clippers, and then clipped two more to even them out. Coworker B was upset, called it disgusting, and the friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Clipping nails at work isn't typically covered in dress codes, but it's about being considerate. If someone does it in a shared space, the noise and the action might bother others. The friend did it in her cubicle, which is semi-private. But Coworker B was clearly disturbed by the sound and the act itself, even from a distance.\n\nThe friend's response of \"chill out\" could come off as dismissive. Maybe she didn't realize how her actions affected others. But the initial act of clipping a hanging nail might be seen as necessary. However, clipping two more after that could be excessive, especially if it's causing a disturbance. The key points are the frequency, location, and the reaction of the coworker.\n\nOn one hand, dealing with a medical issue like a hanging nail is understandable. On the other hand, doing it multiple times in a visible/clearly audible way might not be considerate. The friend's response wasn't helpful, which could escalate the situation. So, maybe the author is at least partially at fault for not being more considerate of others' sensitivities, even if the initial act was necessary. But is that enough to say she's in the wrong? Or is the coworker overreacting? It's a bit of a grey area. However, since the friend continued after being asked to stop, and the coworker was genuinely upset, the answer might lean towards A. But I'm not 100% sure.\n"
