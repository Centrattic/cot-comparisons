And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that the friend mentioned having a hanging nail and used clippers at her cubicle. Then coworker B overheard, got upset, and told her not to do it because it's disgusting. The friend then clipped more nails and got a text from coworker B complaining about the noise. The friend replied with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether clipping nails at work is inappropriate. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the scenario.\n\nFirst, consider workplace etiquette. Some people might find nail clipping gross because of the noise or the idea of doing it in public spaces. Others might think it's fine if done in a private or personal space like a cubicle. The friend's cubicle is her own area, so she might feel it's okay. But coworker B was clearly disturbed by it, which caused a conflict.\n\nThe friend's initial remark about having a hanging nail and using clippers might have been casual, but coworker B's reaction was strong. Then the friend clipped more nails after the initial one, which could be seen as provoking or not respecting the coworker's feelings. The response \"chill out\" might have been dismissive, which could escalate the situation.\n\nWorkplace norms vary. Some offices allow it, others don't. If the company has rules against it, then the friend might be wrong. But if there's no policy, it's more about mutual respect. The key points are: did the friend consider her coworker's feelings? She clipped nails after being told it's gross, which could be seen as ignoring the other person's discomfort. Also, the noise being heard from 100 feet away might be excessive, suggesting the friend wasn't being considerate of others' senses.\n\nBut on the other hand, the friend was in her own cubicle, and clipping nails is a personal hygiene task. Maybe she didn't realize the noise level, or it was a minor action. The initial remark to a coworker was just making a comment, not doing it in front of everyone. However, after being confronted, continuing to clip more nails and then responding with \"chill out\" could be seen as dismissive.\n\nSo, it's a bit of a gray area. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the friend acted without considering the coworker's feelings, especially after being told it was a problem, then she might be at fault. If the coworker's reaction is overly sensitive, then maybe not. However, in a shared workspace, it's important to be considerate. Since the friend continued after being told to stop, and then dismissed the coworker's feelings, that's likely where the issue lies. Therefore, the friend might be in the wrong.\n"
