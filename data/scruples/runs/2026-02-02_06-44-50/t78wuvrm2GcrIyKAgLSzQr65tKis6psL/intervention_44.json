And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that she mentioned having a hanging nail and used clippers, then Coworker B got upset and told her not to do it. The friend then clipped more nails and got a text from Coworker B complaining about the noise and calling it disgusting. The friend just said \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, first, is clipping nails at work gross or not? It's a common debate. Some people find it gross because of the noise and the sight, others don't. But is it unprofessional? Maybe depending on the workplace culture. If the workplace has specific rules against eating or doing certain things, but clipping nails isn't specified, it might be a judgment call.\n\nThe friend's actions: She clipped a nail, then did two more to \"even things out.\" Then after Coworker B complained, she continued. The response of \"chill out\" could be seen as dismissive, especially if the coworker is genuinely bothered. But maybe the friend felt her right to do something personal in her cubicle.\n\nIs it the friend's fault? Well, if the coworker is being overly sensitive, maybe not. But if the friend knew or should have known that it's not acceptable in the workplace, then maybe. The friend's justification is that she was in her own cubicle, so doing it there. But the noise travels, so perhaps she should have been more considerate.\n\nWorkplace etiquette often suggests avoiding certain activities that might disturb others, even if not explicitly prohibited. So, even if it's not against the rules, causing discomfort to coworkers could be seen as inconsiderate. The friend's response to a complaint by saying \"chill out\" might escalate the issue instead of addressing it politely.\n\nBut then again, Coworker B's reaction is quite strong. Maybe they have a personal issue. However, the friend could have taken the complaint seriously and tried to find a solution, like doing it during a break or in a more private area.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: The friend might be at fault for not considering others' feelings and responding dismissively, but Coworker B's reaction might also be over the top. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Given that she continued clipping after a complaint and used a dismissive reply, it's possible she's at fault. So the answer might be A, yes.\n"
