And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about whether clipping nails at work is inappropriate. The friend did it once because of a hanging nail, then clipped two more to even them out. Coworker B was really upset about it, even hearing the clippers from 100 feet away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider office etiquette. Some people might find it gross because it involves body fluids and the sound can be distracting. But others might think it's a normal thing to do if you're in a private space like your cubicle. The friend wasn't doing it in common areas, just in her own space. However, Coworker B was clearly offended and called it disgusting. \n\nThe author's friend responded with \"chill out,\" which might come off as dismissive. Maybe she should have considered other coworkers' feelings more. Even if it's technically allowed, if it's bothering people, maybe she should avoid it. But is it really the author's fault? It's a common practice for some people, like trimming nails at work if needed. The key points are privacy, noise, and company policies. If there's no policy against it, it might not be the author's fault. However, if it's causing discomfort to others, maybe she should adjust. But since it's in her cubicle, maybe it's acceptable. Hmm, still a bit torn. I think the answer depends on company norms, but generally, if there's no rule, it's not the author's fault. So answer B.\n"
