And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the friend (the author's friend) was in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The user is asking if the author's friend is an asshole (AITA), and the user thinks she is.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The friend was clipping a hanging nail and mentioned it to a coworker. Then a third coworker, B, overheard and demanded she stop because it was disgusting. The friend clipped the nail, then did two more to \"even things out.\" After that, coworker B sent a message about hearing her from 100 feet away and called it gross. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the key points here are:\n\n1. The act of clipping nails at work: Is this generally acceptable or not? Some people find it gross because of the noise and mess. Others see it as a minor task that's necessary.\n\n2. The friend's actions after being told it was disgusting. She continued and even clipped more nails, which might have escalated the situation.\n\n3. The response \"chill out\" could be seen as dismissive or not taking coworker B's feelings into account.\n\nNow, considering workplace etiquette. Workplaces vary, but generally, people are expected to be considerate of others. Clipping nails can be noisy and unsanitary, which might bother others. However, if the friend did it in her own cubicle and wasn't being disruptive beyond the noise, maybe it's a personal choice.\n\nBut coworker B was clearly upset. The friend continued after being told not to, which might indicate a lack of consideration. The friend's response of \"chill out\" suggests she didn't take coworker B's feelings seriously, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nHowever, the initial act of clipping a nail isn't inherently wrong. The problem might be the continuation after being asked and the dismissive response. The friend's justification for clipping more nails to \"even things out\" might not be a valid reason in the eyes of others.\n\nIn some workplaces, there are policies against certain activities that could be seen as unhygienic or disruptive. If there's no such policy, it's more of a personal preference issue. But in this case, the coworker was clearly disturbed, and the friend didn't adjust her behavior.\n\nSo, while clipping nails might not be the worst thing, the friend's actions after being confronted and her dismissive attitude might make her the asshole. The key is whether the friend was considerate of her coworker's feelings. Since she continued and even clipped more, and responded dismissively, that's where the issue lies.\n"
