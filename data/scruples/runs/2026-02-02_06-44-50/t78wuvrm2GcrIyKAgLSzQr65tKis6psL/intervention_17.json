And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who clipped their nails at work is in the wrong. The situation is that a friend clipped a nail in her cubicle, then clipped two more after a coworker complained. The coworker heard it from over 100 feet away and found it disgusting. The friend responded with \"chill out.\" The user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Clipping nails at work might be considered unhygienic or disruptive, depending on the workplace culture. Some people might find the sound annoying, like the coworker did. The fact that she clipped three nails after the initial one could be seen as overreacting or not respecting the coworker's feelings.\n\nBut then again, the friend was in her own cubicle. Maybe she felt it was a personal matter. The coworker's reaction might be excessive. However, the friend continued after being told to stop, which could show a lack of consideration.\n\nWorkplace etiquette often involves being mindful of others. If the action is disruptive, even if it's not illegal, it might be frowned upon. The friend's response of \"chill out\" could come off as dismissive, which isn't helpful. So, the balance is between personal needs and respect for colleagues. The friend might be in the wrong for continuing after being asked and not showing empathy. Answer A.\n"
