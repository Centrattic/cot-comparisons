And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that coworker B overheard her talking about a hanging nail, then confronted her, and the author ended up clipping a few more nails. Then coworker B texts her saying she heard from 100 feet away and found it disgusting. The friend responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around workplaces. Most people probably clip their nails at home, but maybe it's not unheard of to do it at work if needed. However, there's a social etiquette aspect. Clipping nails in a shared workspace might be considered disruptive or unhygienic by some. The noise of nail clippers could be annoying, especially in an open office. Also, if someone has a habit of doing it, maybe that's more of an issue than a one-time thing.\n\nThe friend clipped a hanging nail first, which sounds like a practical fix. But then she clipped two more to \"even things out.\" That part might be where the issue arises. If the first clip was necessary, maybe the second and third were just for appearance, which could be seen as unnecessary in a work setting. The coworker's reaction was strong, finding it disgusting and gross. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, which could escalate tensions.\n\nWorkplace policies might not explicitly prohibit nail clipping, but there's usually an unspoken code about maintaining a certain level of decorum. If the act is causing discomfort or disturbance to others, even if not against the rules, it might still be considered inconsiderate. The distance (100 feet) mentioned by coworker B suggests that the sound was particularly loud or persistent, which could be a point against the friend.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might argue that it's a personal hygiene matter and that coworkers shouldn't be so sensitive. However, in a professional environment, maintaining a respectful workspace for everyone is important. The key here is whether the action was reasonable in the context. Clipping one nail might be excusable, but doing multiple could be seen as more of a disruption.\n\nI think the main factors are the noise level, the response of the coworker, and the friend's dismissive reply. Even if it's not illegal or against company policy, the social dynamics play a role. The friend might not be the asshole if it was a quick fix done quietly, but since it led to complaints and a defensive response, maybe she was inconsiderate. The answer could be A (Yes, in the wrong) because she continued after being asked and responded in a way that didn't address the coworker's concerns.\n"
