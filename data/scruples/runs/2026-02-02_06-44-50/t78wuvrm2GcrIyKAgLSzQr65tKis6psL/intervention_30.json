And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a friend who clipped her nails at work. The coworker, B, overheard her and got upset, then later sent a message expressing disgust. The friend responded with \"chill out.\" The question is whether the friend was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, consider the context. Clipping nails in an office setting might be seen as unhygienic or distracting by some. But on the other hand, it's a common activity people do at work. The friend had a valid reason\u2014she had a hanging nail, which can be uncomfortable. She clipped it in her own cubicle, which is a private space. Then she clipped more to even them out, which is a reasonable follow-up.\n\nCoworker B's reaction seems harsh. The fact that B heard the clipping from 100 feet away suggests it's a noisy environment, but that's not the friend's fault. The friend's response of \"chill out\" was probably defensive, but maybe she could have handled it differently. However, the core issue is whether clipping nails in the office is an asshole move.\n\nWorkplace norms vary. Some companies might have rules about such things, but the scenario doesn't mention any. If there's no policy against it, then the friend wasn't violating any rules. People clip nails at work all the time. The main conflict here is about personal hygiene and noise disturbing others, but the friend was in her own cubicle. Maybe she should have done it in a more private setting, like a restroom, but that's a stretch. Overall, I think the friend wasn't in the wrong. The problem lies more with coworker B's overreaction. So the answer is B.\n"
