And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work.\n\nFirst, the situation: She mentions having a hanging nail and uses clippers at her desk. Coworker B overhears, confronts her, and later texts her saying it's gross. The friend then clips two more nails and responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nNow, considering office etiquette. Clipping nails at work isn't uncommon, but it can be disruptive or unhygienic depending on the environment. The key points here are that Coworker B was clearly offended, even to the point of hearing the clipping from 100 feet away. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, which could escalate tensions.\n\nIn many workplaces, there are unspoken rules about what's acceptable. If the workplace culture is such that nail clipping is frowned upon, then the friend might be in the wrong. However, if there's no formal policy against it, it's more about personal preferences. The friend's action of clipping after being told to stop could be seen as disrespectful or inconsiderate, especially after being directly asked. The act of clipping three nails in one go might also be seen as excessive, leading to the coworker's continued discomfort.\n\nOn the other hand, if the friend had done this discreetly, maybe in a break room or when no one was around, it might not be an issue. But doing it in her cubicle where others can hear and feel it's public could be problematic. The \"chill out\" response might not be the best way to handle the situation diplomatically.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: the friend's actions were inconsiderate of Coworker B's feelings, especially after being explicitly told to stop. The response was dismissive, which isn't respectful. Therefore, the friend is likely in the wrong.\n"
