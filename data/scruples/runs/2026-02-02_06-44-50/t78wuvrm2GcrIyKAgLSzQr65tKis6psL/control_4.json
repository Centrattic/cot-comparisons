And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the friend who clipped her nails at work is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. A coworker overheard her mention it and then another coworker, B, demanded she not clip them. The friend then clipped more nails and got a text from coworker B being upset. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nNow, the key points here are office etiquette and what's considered acceptable behavior. Nail clipping can be a sensitive topic because of noise and possible discomfort for others. But it's also a personal hygiene matter.\n\nCoworker B found it disgusting and was disturbed by the sound, even from 100 feet away. The friend clipped more nails after the initial one. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, which could escalate tensions. \n\nBut is clipping nails inherently wrong? It's not illegal, but it's about workplace policies and social norms. If the workplace doesn't prohibit it, then the friend isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, being considerate is important. If coworker B was bothered, maybe the friend should have been more discreet or done it in a private space. However, she was in her own cubicle, which might be considered a semi-private area.\n\nThe fact that the friend took the opportunity to clip more nails after B's complaint could be seen as a provocation. But maybe she just wanted to even them out. The response \"chill out\" is probably the main issue here. It's not a great way to handle someone's discomfort. \n\nSo, the friend might be in the wrong for not considering coworker B's feelings and for the dismissive reply. But if the workplace doesn't have a rule against it, the act itself isn't necessarily wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the way she responded to the complaint is definitely an issue. \n\nIn terms of the overall assessment, the friend might be the asshole for not being considerate and for the tone of the response. But some might argue that it's a minor issue and not a big deal. I think the answer is A (yes, she's in the wrong) because the response was dismissive and she could have been more considerate of the coworker's feelings. But maybe B is not the right answer either. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the workplace allows it, then she's not in the wrong. It's possible that the coworker is being overly sensitive. The answer could be B. But the act of clipping in the cubicle might be okay, but the reaction and response are problematic. \n\nThis is tricky. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong. The act itself is debatable, but the response to the coworker's complaint is not. The \"chill out\" is a poor response. So maybe the friend is in the wrong for not handling the situation better. So answer A.\n"
