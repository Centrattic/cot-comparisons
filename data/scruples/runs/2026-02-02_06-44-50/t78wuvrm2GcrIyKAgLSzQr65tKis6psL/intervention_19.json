And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about clipping nails at work. The friend clipped a hanging nail and then did two more to even them out. Coworker B heard the clipping from far away and found it disgusting. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Clipping nails at work isn't common, but maybe it's not against the rules. However, if it's causing a disturbance or making others uncomfortable, that's a problem. The friend did it in her own cubicle, but the noise traveled, which Coworker B found gross. The friend's response was dismissive, which might have escalated the situation.\n\nIs it reasonable to clip nails in the office? Maybe if it's done discreetly, but using clippers can make noise. If Coworker B is sensitive to that noise, the friend might be infringing on their comfort. The friend's actions led to a direct complaint, and then she did more clipping. That could be seen as ignoring the coworker's feelings. Also, the response \"chill out\" might be seen as defensive or dismissive, not empathetic.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the coworker is being overly sensitive. Nail clipping isn't a major issue, and the friend was just fixing a problem. But the key points are that the friend continued after being told it was disturbing, and the workplace environment should consider others' comfort. So the author's friend might be in the wrong for not respecting Coworker B's discomfort, even if it's a minor thing. Hence, Answer A.\n"
