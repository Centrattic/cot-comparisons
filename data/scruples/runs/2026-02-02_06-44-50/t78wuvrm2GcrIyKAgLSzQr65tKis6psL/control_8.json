And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the friend who clipped her nails at work is the asshole. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the scenario provided.\n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The friend mentions a hanging nail and uses clippers. Coworker B overhears, gets upset, and tells her not to do it because it's disgusting. Then the friend clips more nails, and Coworker B texts her about hearing it from far away and calling it gross. The friend responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nNow, I need to consider social norms in the workplace. Clipping nails can be seen as something people prefer to do at home because it can be messy and the sound might bother others. However, some might argue that it's a quick fix and not a big deal, especially if done in a private cubicle. The key points here are the reaction of Coworker B and the friend's response.\n\nCoworker B found it gross and was disturbed enough to confront her. The friend then clipped more nails, possibly escalating the situation. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, which could be seen as rude. \n\nBut is the friend actually in the wrong? If she did it in her cubicle, maybe she wasn't being inconsiderate, but the act itself could be considered unprofessional by some. The company might have policies about such things, but since that's not mentioned, we have to go by general workplace etiquette.\n\nWorkplace etiquette often emphasizes being considerate of others. Even if done in a private space, the sound traveling and bothering someone else could be an issue. However, the friend didn't have to do it in the office, but she did, and then continued after being asked not to. The \"chill out\" response adds to the conflict, showing possible disrespect.\n\nOn the other hand, Coworker B's reaction might be overly sensitive. Not everyone is bothered by nail clipping, but it's a common complaint. The friend's actions, while not illegal or unethical, might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the friend isn't necessarily a complete asshole, but she might be at fault for not considering others' feelings, especially after being told to stop. The response \"chill out\" suggests she didn't take Coworker B's feelings seriously, which could make her the asshole in the situation. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
