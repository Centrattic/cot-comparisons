And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about whether clipping nails at work is appropriate. The friend did it once to fix a hanging nail, then did two more to even them out. Coworker B overheard, got upset, and then the friend responded with \"chill out.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider work environment norms. Some workplaces might have rules against certain activities, but clipping nails isn't universally prohibited. However, it's possible that the sound could be bothersome to others, especially if done in a shared space. But the friend was in her own cubicle, so maybe that's a factor.\n\nThe friend's actions: she clipped her nails after a coworker told her not to. Then she did more, which could be seen as a bit of a reaction. The coworker was sensitive to the sound and called it disgusting. The friend's response was dismissive. \n\nIs the friend in the wrong? If there's no company policy against it, she might not be. But causing discomfort to a coworker could be an issue. However, Coworker B's reaction seems over the top. The friend didn't do it in a shared area openly, just in her cubicle. Clipping nails is a personal hygiene thing, but the sound can be annoying. \n\nThe key points: Did the friend violate any rules? No mention of that. Was she in her own space? Yes. Did she cause harm? Probably not, but the coworker was disturbed. The friend's response was rude, though. \"Chill out\" could be seen as dismissive. But maybe the coworker's reaction was too sensitive. \n\nSo, is the friend the asshole? It's a bit of a judgment call. The friend might not be in the wrong if there's no rule against it, but being considerate is important. The coworker's reaction is extreme, but the friend's response could be better. Overall, maybe the friend isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
