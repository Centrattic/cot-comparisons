And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) story. The friend clipped her nails in her cubicle after a coworker told her not to. The coworker then complained again after hearing her clip more nails.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Clipping nails at work might be a personal hygiene issue. Some people might find it gross, especially if it's done in shared spaces or audible to others. But if the friend did it in her own cubicle, maybe it's acceptable. However, the coworker's reaction is also a factor. The friend clipped again after being told not to, which could be seen as defiant. The response \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, which isn't helpful. \n\nWorkplace etiquette often emphasizes respecting others' comfort. Even if it's allowed, if it's bothering others, maybe the friend should adjust. On the other hand, trimming a hanging nail is a common thing people do. It's a bit of a judgment call. The key points are whether the action is disruptive and if the coworker's reaction is over the top. The friend's actions might be considered inconsiderate if they cause discomfort, but it's not necessarily the end of the world. The answer might hinge on the specific workplace culture and policies. Since the friend continued after being asked, that could tip the scales towards her being in the wrong. So maybe answer A.\n"
