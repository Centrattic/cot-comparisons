Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the friend clipped her nails at work, which led to a conflict with a coworker. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. She mentioned it to a coworker, and then Coworker B overheard. B then went into her cubicle and demanded she not clip nails at work because it's disgusting. The friend then clipped her nail, and maybe two more to even them out. After that, B sent a text saying she could hear the clipping from 100 feet away and found it gross. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether the friend (the author's friend) is the asshole. The user is asking if the author (the friend's story) is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Let's think about workplace norms. Clipping nails at work isn't something I've seen people do often. It's generally considered a personal hygiene task that's done at home. But maybe in some workplaces, it's acceptable if done discreetly. However, using clippers in a cubicle might be heard by others, especially if the workspace is open-plan. If Coworker B is sensitive to sounds like that, it might be an issue. \n\nThe friend clipped the nail in her own cubicle, which is her space. But maybe she did so in a way that was audible to others. The issue here is about respect for others' comfort. Even if it's not a big deal to some, if someone else finds it gross or disruptive, the person doing it might need to consider that. The friend's response of \"chill out\" could be seen as dismissive, which might escalate tensions.\n\nOn the other hand, Coworker B's initial reaction of demanding she not do it could be over the top. But the friend continued after the demand, which might show a lack of consideration. Clipping two more nails could be seen as unnecessary, making the situation worse. \n\nWorkplace etiquette often emphasizes being mindful of others. Even if the act isn't inherently wrong, doing it in a way that affects others might be. The friend might have been inconsiderate, especially after being told it's an issue. However, the coworker's reaction seems a bit extreme, but maybe not entirely unreasonable. \n\nIn some cultures or workplaces, personal grooming during work hours is frowned upon. So clipping nails at work might not be allowed regardless of others' reactions. But the question is about whether the friend is the asshole. If the workplace doesn't have a policy against it, maybe the friend isn't in the wrong, but her actions and response could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nAlternatively, the friend was in her own cubicle, so she might have a right to manage her personal needs, but maybe she should have done it more discreetly. The fact that Coworker B could hear it from 100 feet away suggests it's quite loud, which could be a problem. So maybe the friend was inconsiderate by not being more mindful of the noise.\n\nThe friend's response of \"chill out\" is probably not the best way to handle it. Instead of dismissing the coworker's feelings, she could have apologized or found a solution, like doing it at a different time or place. \n\nConsidering all that, the friend might be in the wrong for continuing to clip nails after being told it's an issue and for responding dismissively. So the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong). But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's a cultural thing. Some people might find clipping nails gross, others don't. The friend's actions could be seen as reasonable if she's doing it in her own space, but the coworker's sensitivity is subjective. However, since the coworker was directly disturbed and the friend didn't take their feedback seriously, the friend might be at fault.\n"
