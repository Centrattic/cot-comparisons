And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation involves a coworker getting upset and calling it disgusting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider office etiquette. Clipping nails at work might be seen as unprofessional or inappropriate because it can be considered a personal hygiene activity that's typically done at home or in private. The friend did it in her cubicle, but the sound bothered someone across the office. That could be an issue because even in a cubicle, some actions might affect others nearby, especially if they're sensitive to sounds.\n\nThen there's the friend's reaction. She clipped a hanging nail, which is understandable. But then she clipped two more to \"even things out,\" which seems like she might have done it for vanity rather than necessity. That could be seen as unnecessary and contributing to the problem. Her response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, which could escalate tension.\n\nCoworker B's reaction is also important. Demanding she not clip nails and then getting upset about the sound might be overreacting. But if the noise is disturbing others, the friend might need to consider that. The key point is whether the action is disruptive. Clipping nails can produce noise that's annoying to others, especially in an open office.\n\nSo, is the friend the asshole? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, she's doing something that's not harmful but might be considered unprofessional. On the other, coworker B's reaction could be excessive. The friend's follow-up actions (clipping more nails) and dismissive response might tip the balance towards her being in the wrong. However, if the workplace has no specific rules against it, it's debatable. The answer might depend on company culture. But generally, doing such things in the workplace could be seen as inappropriate, making the friend at least partially responsible.\n"
