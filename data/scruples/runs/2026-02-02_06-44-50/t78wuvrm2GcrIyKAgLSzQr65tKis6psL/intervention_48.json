And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation involves a coworker getting upset and confronting her, and then the author responding with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around workplace behavior. Clipping nails isn't inherently wrong, but the context matters. The friend did it in her cubicle, which is a semi-private space. However, the sound carried across 100 feet, which is pretty far. Some people find the sound annoying, so that could be a point against her. \n\nBut on the other hand, the coworker B was the one who overheard the initial comment and then confronted the friend. The friend clipped her nails after being told, which might be a reaction to being scolded. Then, clipping two more to \"even things out\" could be seen as a bit of a retort, which might not be the best approach. \n\nThe friend's response of \"chill out\" after receiving a text from coworker B might come off as dismissive. It could escalate the situation instead of resolving it. However, the act of clipping nails itself isn't something that's necessarily against workplace rules unless specified. \n\nI should also think about workplace policies. If there's a rule against eating or doing certain things at work, maybe clipping nails isn't covered. But if it's not specified, it's more about social norms. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, some people are sensitive to the noise of nail clippers, so maybe the friend should have done it outside the office hours or in a private area. But since she was in her cubicle, it's debatable. \n\nSo, there's a balance here. The coworker B might be overly sensitive, but the friend's actions after being confronted (clipping more nails and responding dismissively) could be seen as provocative. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the author might have a point in that coworker B is being overly judgmental, but her actions in response (clipping more and the dismissive reply) could be seen as inconsiderate. It's a bit of a toss-up, but maybe the author is partially at fault for continuing the behavior and the tone of her response. However, the main issue is whether the initial act was wrong. Since it's in her cubicle and not a shared space, maybe it's not entirely her fault. But the response to the coworker's complaint definitely plays a role. \n\nHmm, the key elements are the location (cubicle, somewhat private), the sound disturbance, and the reaction after being confronted. The answer might hinge on workplace norms and how considerate each party is. The friend's \"chill out\" might be the more problematic part. If the author had just apologized and stopped, maybe it would be different. But by continuing and responding that way, she could be seen as the asshole. So, leaning towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong), but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the coworker was being unreasonable, maybe not. But since the question is about the author's actions, the fact that she continued and responded dismissively could tip it towards her being wrong.\n"
