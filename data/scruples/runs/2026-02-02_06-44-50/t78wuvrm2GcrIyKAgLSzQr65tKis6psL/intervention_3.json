And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author (the friend in the story) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work.\n\nFirst, the situation: the friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. Coworker B overheard her talking about it, then approached and told her not to clip nails at work because it's disgusting. Later, the friend clipped more nails and got a text from Coworker B complaining about the noise and calling it gross. The friend replied with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the main issue is whether clipping nails at work is inappropriate. I need to consider both perspectives. \n\nFrom Coworker B's side, they found the act of clipping nails in the workplace gross and disturbing enough to confront the friend. The noise could be a disturbance, especially if the office is quiet. People have different sensitivities to sounds like nail clippers. If the company has policies against such things, that could matter. Also, maybe there's a hygiene concern, but that's subjective.\n\nOn the friend's side, she had a practical reason (fixing a hangnail) and then did more to \"even things out.\" Her response of \"chill out\" might be seen as dismissive. Maybe she didn't consider that others might find the sound annoying. However, clipping nails is a common habit, and people might do it anywhere if no rules exist.\n\nI need to think about workplace norms. In many offices, it's not explicitly forbidden, but it's considered unprofessional or distracting. The key points are whether the action is disruptive and if there's a company policy against it. The friend didn't ask if it was okay, so maybe she assumed it was fine. But Coworker B was clearly upset, so perhaps the friend should have been more considerate. \n\nAlso, the friend continued after being told it was gross, which could be seen as not respecting the coworker's feelings. However, Coworker B's reaction might be over the top. It's a balance between personal habits and workplace etiquette. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the friend's actions were disruptive or against company policy. Since there's no mention of a policy, but the act of clipping nails can be disruptive, the friend might be in the wrong for not considering others' comfort and continuing after being asked to stop. So, Answer A.\n"
