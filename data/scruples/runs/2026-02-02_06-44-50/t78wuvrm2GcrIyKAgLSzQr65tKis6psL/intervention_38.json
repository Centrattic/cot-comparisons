And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that the friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. Coworker B overheard the comment, confronted her, and then the friend clipped more nails after being told not to. Now, coworker B is upset about the noise and finds it disgusting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Clipping nails at work isn't common, but maybe it's not strictly prohibited unless there's a policy against it. The friend did it in her cubicle, so maybe she thought it was private. But coworker B heard her from 100 feet away, which suggests the noise was disruptive. That could be an issue if the workplace values quiet environments.\n\nCoworker B's reaction seems strong. Demanding she not do it might have been over the top, but the friend then continued clipping, possibly escalating the situation by \"evening things out\" after the confrontation. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, which could add to the tension.\n\nThe key points are: Was the friend's action disruptive? If the noise was heard from far away, maybe it was. Also, the friend continued after being asked to stop, which could be seen as inconsiderate. However, coworker B's initial demand without considering if there was a policy might also be at fault.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. From a typical workplace etiquette standpoint, even if there's no rule, doing something that's loud and might be considered unsanitary (like clipping nails) in a shared space could be seen as inappropriate. The friend did it after being told not to, which is a problem. So, the answer might lean towards A (Yes). But I should also consider that coworker B's reaction was extreme. However, the question is about the author's actions. Since the friend ignored the coworker's request and continued, leading to more complaints, that's probably on her. So the answer is A.\n"
