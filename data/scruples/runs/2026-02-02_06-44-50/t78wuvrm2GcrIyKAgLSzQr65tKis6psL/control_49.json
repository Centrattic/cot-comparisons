And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong here. The situation is about clipping nails at work. So, first, I need to break down the scenario.\n\nThe friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. Coworker B overheard her, then demanded she not do it. Then the friend clipped more nails and Coworker B heard from far away, leading to a complaint about it being gross. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nNow, the main points to consider: Is clipping nails in the office considered inappropriate? It depends on workplace norms. Some people might find it gross because of the noise or possible mess, but others might see it as a normal thing to do, especially if done in a private cubicle. The friend was in her own cubicle, so maybe not in a shared space. But Coworker B was bothered by the noise over distance. \n\nThe friend clipped three nails, which might be seen as overdoing it if she just had one hanging nail. Also, the response \"chill out\" could come off as dismissive. Coworker B's reaction is about hygiene or noise, but the friend's actions after being told might be seen as ignoring the colleague's feelings. \n\nWorkplace etiquette often involves considering others' comfort. If Coworker B is clearly upset, the friend's action of continuing and even clipping more could be seen as inconsiderate. However, some might argue that it's a minor issue and not a big deal. \n\nBut the key points here are that Coworker B was disturbed by the noise from over 100 feet away, which is unusual. The friend's response was dismissive, which could escalate tension. The act of clipping in the cubicle might be acceptable, but continuing after being told not to by a colleague could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the friend might be in the wrong because she didn't take Coworker B's discomfort seriously and continued the action, possibly making a bigger deal out of it by clipping more nails. But others might say it's a small thing. However, since Coworker B was clearly bothered and the friend's actions were in response to a direct request, the friend's actions might be considered the asshole move. \n\nAnswer: A\n"
