And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author's friend (and thus the author by extension) did something wrong by clipping their nails at work. The situation involves a coworker getting upset and calling it disgusting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common workplace norms. Nail clipping can be a bit of a sensitive topic. Some people find it gross because of the noise or the idea of trimming nails in a public or shared space. But others might think it's a personal hygiene thing that's necessary and shouldn't be an issue.\n\nThe friend initially had a hanging nail and clipped it in her cubicle. Then she clipped two more to \"even things out.\" The coworker overheard, got upset, and sent a text about hearing it from 100 feet away. The friend responded with \"chill out,\" which might have come off as dismissive.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the act of clipping nails in a workplace, the reaction of the coworker, and the friend's response. \n\nIs clipping nails inherently wrong? It's subjective. Some workplaces might have rules about such things, but if there's no explicit policy, it's hard to say. The friend did it in her own cubicle, which is a personal space, so maybe it's reasonable. However, the noise travels, which is a valid concern for Coworker B. The friend's decision to clip two more nails after the initial one might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. Also, responding with \"chill out\" could be seen as not respecting the coworker's feelings, even if the friend doesn't think there's a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, it's a personal choice, and if the workplace doesn't prohibit it, the friend isn't necessarily in the wrong. The coworker's reaction is strong, but it's possible she's being overly sensitive. The friend's actions were in her own cubicle, so it's an individual choice that might not affect others beyond the noise.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong. The \"asshole\" label depends on whether the action violates social norms or workplace etiquette. Since there's no clear rule against it, it's a judgment call. However, the friend's response might have been dismissive, which could be seen as not considering the coworker's feelings. But the act itself is debatable.\n\nIn some cases, people might argue that doing such a personal activity in a shared workspace, even in your own cubicle, is inconsiderate because of the noise. Others might say it's a personal hygiene issue that's acceptable. The key factors are the context and the friend's response. The friend didn't apologize or acknowledge the concern, which might make her seem dismissive. But if the action itself is not against any rules, maybe she's not the asshole.\n\nHmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. The answer might depend on cultural or company norms. Since the question is about whether the author is wrong, and the answer is A or B, I need to decide if the action is objectively wrong or not. Since there's no rule mentioned, and the friend acted in her own space, maybe she's not wrong. However, the response could be seen as inconsiderate. But the main question is about the act of clipping nails, not the response. The response is part of the story, but the core issue is the action.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No), because clipping a nail in your own cubicle isn't inherently wrong, and there's no policy against it. The coworker's reaction is strong but subjective, and the friend's actions don't clearly violate any rules. The \"asshole\" label might not apply here since it's a matter of personal preference unless there's a specific rule against it.\n"
