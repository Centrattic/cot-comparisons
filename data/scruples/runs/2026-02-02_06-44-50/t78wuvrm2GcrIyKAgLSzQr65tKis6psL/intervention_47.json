And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the friend in the story) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The scenario involves some conflict between coworkers, so I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, let's break down the events. The friend mentioned she had a hanging nail and used her clippers. Then Coworker B overheard, confronted her, and told her not to do it at work. The friend then clipped more nails in her cubicle, and Coworker B texted her, upset about the noise and calling it disgusting. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nNow, considering workplace etiquette. Nail clipping can be a sensitive topic. Some people find the sound annoying or the act gross, while others might see it as a personal grooming task. The key factors here are whether the friend was disruptive and if there were any workplace policies against it.\n\nThe friend clipped her nails in her own cubicle, which is private space. However, the sound traveled over 100 feet, which Coworker B found disturbing. Even if it's in a private area, if it's causing a disturbance to others, that could be an issue. But is that the friend's fault? She might not have known the noise would carry that far.\n\nAnother angle: the initial confrontation by Coworker B was direct. The friend responded by clipping more nails, which escalated the situation. Then, when confronted again via text, she told the coworker to \"chill out,\" which could be seen as dismissive or rude.\n\nWorkplace norms vary. Some offices might consider nail clipping okay if done in private, others not. If there's a rule against it, the friend is in the wrong. If not, maybe she's not. But even without explicit rules, common courtesy suggests considering others' sensitivities. The friend might not have been aware of the noise's impact until Coworker B pointed it out. However, after being told not to do it, continuing to clip more nails shows a lack of consideration.\n\nThe response \"chill out\" could be seen as defensive and not taking the coworker's feelings into account. That might contribute to her being in the wrong. On the other hand, Coworker B's reaction seems over the top, but the friend's actions did lead to the conflict.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the friend could have been more considerate of the noise and the coworker's feelings, especially after being warned. However, Coworker B's initial confrontation might have been harsh. But since the friend continued clipping after being told not to, leading to more issues, she might be at fault here.\n"
