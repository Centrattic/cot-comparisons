And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The scenario involves a coworker getting upset and confronting her, then the friend clippers more nails and responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Clipping nails at work might be considered unprofessional or unsanitary by some. It can create mess, and there's a hygiene aspect. But others might see it as a quick fix for a minor issue when in a private space like a cubicle.\n\nThe friend's actions: She clipped one hanging nail initially, then clipped more to \"even things out.\" The coworker was bothered by the noise and cleanliness. The friend responded dismissively. \n\nCoworker B might have a valid concern about hygiene and workspace cleanliness. However, her reaction of demanding the friend to stop in person and then texting to complain could be seen as overreacting. \n\nThe friend's response of \"chill out\" isn't ideal. It shows a lack of consideration for others' feelings. Even if the friend feels her action is reasonable, acknowledging the coworker's sensitivity might have been better. \n\nIs clipping nails inherently wrong? It's subjective. Some workplaces might have rules against it. But if there's no policy, it's more about personal boundaries. The friend might have been in her own space, but the noise and possible mess could affect coworkers. \n\nThe key points: Coworker B's strong reaction vs. the friend's dismissive reply. The friend's decision to clip more nails after being told might have escalated things. \n\nIf the workplace doesn't prohibit it, maybe the friend isn't the asshole, but her actions post-confrontation might be questionable. However, Coworker B's reaction could also be excessive. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the friend's actions violated company policy or common courtesy. Since there's no mention of a policy, it's more about sensitivity. The friend didn't consider the coworker's feelings after being told, so maybe she's in the wrong for continuing and responding snippily. But maybe Coworker B is overreacting. \n\nHmm. The question is if the author is wrong. The friend's main fault is continuing after being asked to stop and then being dismissive. So maybe A (Yes). But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if there's no rule against it, maybe B (No). But the response to the complaint is problematic. So probably A.\n"
