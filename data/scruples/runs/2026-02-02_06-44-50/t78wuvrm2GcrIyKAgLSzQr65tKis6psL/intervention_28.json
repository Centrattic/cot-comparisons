And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that she clipped a hanging nail, then clipped two more to even them out, which annoyed a coworker. The coworker was upset and called it disgusting, and the friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider office etiquette. Clipping nails at work is a common debate. Some people might find it gross or unhygienic, while others think it's a quick fix. The key points here are the context and the response. The friend had a specific reason for clipping (a hanging nail), which might be more understandable than doing it for no reason. However, clipping two more nails after that could be seen as unnecessary, especially if it's bothering others. The coworker was clearly disturbed by the sound and the act itself, which suggests it's a sensitive issue in their workplace.\n\nThe friend's response of \"chill out\" might have come off as dismissive. Even if the coworker is overreacting, the way the friend responded could escalate the situation. It's important to consider the workplace environment. If there are no specific rules against it, maybe the friend isn't necessarily wrong, but the response could be part of the problem. However, if the coworker is particularly sensitive, the friend might need to adjust her behavior to maintain a good working relationship. \n\nAnother angle is that clipping nails in a private space (her cubicle) might be acceptable, but if the sound travels and bothers others, maybe there's a way to do it more discreetly. The friend could have done it during a break or in a restroom to avoid the noise. The fact that she did it in her cubicle might not be inherently wrong, but the impact on others is a factor. \n\nSo, balancing both perspectives: the coworker's discomfort is valid in a shared workspace, and the friend's actions, while maybe understandable, could have been handled more considerately. The \"chill out\" response might be the part where the author crosses into being inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for not considering the coworker's feelings and responding dismissively.\n"
