And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is a bit of a social dilemma.\n\nFirst, the friend had a hanging nail and used clippers to fix it. Then Coworker B overheard and told her not to do it because it's disgusting. The friend then clipped more nails and Coworker B heard her from far away, leading to more complaints. The friend just said \"chill out.\"\n\nNow, I need to decide if the friend was wrong. Let's break it down. Clipping nails can be considered gross by some people because of the sound and the debris. In an office setting, people might be sensitive about things that make noise or create mess. If the friend did it in her cubicle, maybe it's a private space, but the sound still traveled. \n\nOn the other hand, having a hanging nail might be uncomfortable, and fixing it quickly is practical. But Coworker B felt strongly enough to confront her. The friend's response was dismissive, which might have escalated things. \n\nWorkplace etiquette usually involves being considerate of others' sensitivities. Even if the action is common, if it's bothering someone else, the person doing it might need to adjust. However, Coworker B's reaction seems a bit over the top, but the friend's response wasn't helpful either. \n\nSo is the friend in the wrong? Maybe partially. She should have considered the noise and maybe done it in a bathroom or a more private area. Clipping in her cubicle and continuing after being asked might not be the best choice. But Coworker B's reaction is also extreme. The friend's actions could be seen as inconsiderate, so maybe answer A (Yes, she's in the wrong). But some might argue B (No, it's not her fault). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the friend isn't in the wrong because Coworker B is being overly sensitive. But workplace norms often require some compromise. The key is whether the action is unreasonably disturbing to others. If it's audible across the office, that's a problem. So the friend should have been more discreet. Therefore, Answer A.\n"
