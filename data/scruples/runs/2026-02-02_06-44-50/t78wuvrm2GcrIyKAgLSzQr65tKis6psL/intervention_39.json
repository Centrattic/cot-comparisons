And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the friend who clipped their nails at work is the asshole. The user thinks they are in the wrong, but wants to see what I think.\n\nFirst, the situation: the friend mentioned a hanging nail and used clippers. Coworker B overheard and told her not to do it because it's disgusting. Then the friend clipped more nails and got a text from coworker B who was bothered by the noise from 100 feet away. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, considering office etiquette, clipping nails in public might be seen as unhygienic or distracting. Coworker B's reaction is strong, but maybe they're being overly sensitive. However, the friend did it in her cubicle, which is a semi-private space. But when coworker B specifically asked her to stop, and she continued, that's where the issue arises. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, which isn't great.\n\nOn the other hand, coworker B might be overreacting. Nails are personal grooming, and doing it in a cubicle isn't necessarily a big deal. But the noise being heard from far away could be an issue if it's disturbing others. The key points are: did the friend violate office policies or norms? If there's no policy against it, maybe it's a matter of personal preference. But if coworker B is genuinely disturbed and the friend continued after being asked, that's where the fault lies.\n\nSo, the friend did clip nails after being told to stop, which shows disregard for coworker B's feelings. Even if it's a minor thing, respecting others' comfort is important. The answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because she kept doing it after being asked to stop and responded dismissively.\n"
