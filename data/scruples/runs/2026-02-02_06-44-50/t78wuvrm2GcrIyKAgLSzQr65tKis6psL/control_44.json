And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe friend mentioned having a hanging nail and clipped it. Then Coworker B overheard, got upset, told her not to clip there because it's disgusting. The friend then clipped two more nails to even them out. Coworker B later texts that she heard from 100 feet away and called it disgusting. The friend replied \"chill out.\"\n\nNow, I need to evaluate if the friend was wrong. Let's break down possible angles.\n\nHygiene vs. Discomfort: Clipping nails is a basic hygiene activity. It's something people do regularly. But doing it in the workplace might be considered unseemly because it can be seen as messy or distracting. However, it's also a personal choice. If someone has a medical need, it might be different, but not in this case.\n\nWorkplace Etiquette: Companies often have guidelines about personal grooming. If there's a policy against certain activities, then it's a violation. But the scenario doesn't mention any specific policy. The friend did it in her cubicle, which is a personal space. So maybe it's acceptable unless there's a rule against it.\n\nCoworker's Reaction: Coworker B's response is pretty strong. Demanding that she not clip and then texting later shows that B is very bothered. The friend's reply \"chill out\" seems dismissive. However, if the friend didn't realize the noise or mess was an issue, maybe she's not at fault. On the other hand, if she knew it was bothering others, even after B told her, then clipping more might be inconsiderate.\n\nNoise Factor: Clipping nails can be noisy (snip, snip). If someone is sensitive to sounds, that could be a problem. The friend did it in her cubicle, which is more private, but the sound carried to another area. Maybe it's reasonable to expect that in a shared space, even if it's your own cubicle, the noise might affect others. But again, unless there's a policy against it, it's hard to say she's wrong.\n\nCultural and Personal Differences: Perceptions of what's acceptable vary. Some people find it gross because of the sound or the mess. Others don't mind. If the workplace has a culture where this is usually avoided, then the friend might not fit in. But without explicit rules, it's subjective.\n\nResponsibility: The friend might not have known that it was a problem. Her response to B's initial complaint was to clip more, which could indicate she's not considering others' feelings. However, \"chill out\" suggests she's not malicious. She might be unaware of the impact.\n\nIn summary, the friend did something that some find unpleasant, but unless there's a policy against it, it's a matter of workplace etiquette and sensitivity. The friend's actions after B's complaint might be inconsiderate, but it's not necessarily wrong if there's no rule. Coworker B's reaction might be over the top, but the friend's lack of consideration could make her the asshole. However, without clear rules, it's hard to say she's definitively wrong. So maybe the answer is B (No), but there's a nuance where she could have been more considerate. But since the question is whether she's in the wrong, and there's no policy mentioned, the answer might lean towards B.\n"
