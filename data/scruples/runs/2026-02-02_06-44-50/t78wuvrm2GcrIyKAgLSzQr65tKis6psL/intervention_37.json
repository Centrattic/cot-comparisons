And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about whether clipping nails at work makes someone the asshole. The friend clipped a hanging nail, then clipped two more to even them out. Coworker B overheard the comment, confronted her, and later complained again via text.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Most workplaces have rules about appropriate behavior. Clipping nails can be disruptive with the sound, and might be seen as unhygienic or messy. But it's a common need. However, doing it in a cubicle might be less intrusive than in a shared space. \n\nThe friend's actions: She clipped the nail after being told not to, which could be seen as defiance. Then she clipped two more, potentially escalating the situation. Responding with \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive. \n\nCoworker B's reaction seems strong, but maybe she's overreacting. However, the friend continued the action after being asked to stop, which is a problem. If the workplace has a policy against it, the friend is in the wrong. If not, it's more about sensitivity. Since the friend ignored a direct request, it's possible she's the asshole. But sometimes coworkers have different thresholds for what's acceptable. \n\nI think the key point is that the friend didn't respect the coworker's request, which led to continued disruption. So the answer might be A (yes, she's in the wrong). But maybe there's a middle ground. However, the question is about the author's side, so the friend is the author. Since she continued after being told and responded dismissively, A seems right.\n"
