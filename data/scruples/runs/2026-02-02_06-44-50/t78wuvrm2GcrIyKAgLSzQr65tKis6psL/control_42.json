And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The scenario is about a friend clipping their nails at work, and a coworker got upset about it. The friend clipped a hanging nail first, then did two more to even them out. The coworker heard it from 100 feet away and called it disgusting. The friend said \"chill out.\" The question is whether the author (the friend) is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Some people might find clipping nails at work gross because of the sound or hygiene. Others might think it's a necessary personal grooming task. The friend was in their own cubicle, so maybe they didn't bother others directly. But the coworker was definitely disturbed by the noise.\n\nThe friend clipped a hanging nail first, which is understandable. Then doing two more to even them out might have been an overreaction if the coworker was already annoyed. The coworker's reaction seems extreme, but the friend's response was dismissive (\"chill out\"), which might come off as disrespectful.\n\nWorkplace policies could also matter. If the company has rules against certain activities, that's a factor. But the question doesn't mention any policies, so maybe it's about social norms. The key here is whether the friend overstepped by continuing after being asked to stop. Coworker B told them not to clip, so the friend should have respected that request, even if they disagreed. Continuing after a direct request could be seen as inconsiderate. The friend's actions led to further annoyance, so maybe they are at fault for not heeding the coworker's concerns.\n\nBut Coworker B's reaction might be overly sensitive. Not everyone finds nail clipping gross, and cubicles are semi-private. The friend might not have realized the sound could carry so far. However, the friend's response was dismissive, which could escalate tensions. In a workplace, it's important to consider others' feelings even if you don't agree. The friend's actions after the initial request might be the problem, not the act itself. So, maybe the friend is in the wrong for continuing and for being dismissive.\n"
