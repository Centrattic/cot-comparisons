And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author's friend (and by extension the author) is in the wrong for clipping nails at work. The situation involves Coworker B getting upset after hearing about it.\n\nFirst, the friend clipped a hanging nail to fix it, which seems reasonable. But then she clipped two more to \"even things out.\" That part might be where it goes from practical to maybe unnecessary. Clipping just the problematic nail is one thing, but doing extra ones could be seen as being inconsiderate, especially if it's noisy or done in a shared space.\n\nCoworker B was clearly disturbed by the sound and considered it disgusting. The friend responded with \"chill out,\" which is dismissive and might not help the situation. The key points here are workplace etiquette and respecting others' comfort levels. While trimming a nail in a private cubicle might not be a huge issue, doing it multiple times and causing a disturbance could be seen as inconsiderate. The friend's actions went beyond a quick fix, and her response to Coworker B was disrespectful. So, there's a case for the author being in the wrong because of the excessive clipping and the dismissive reply. But some might argue that it's a minor issue. However, since it's affecting coworkers, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
