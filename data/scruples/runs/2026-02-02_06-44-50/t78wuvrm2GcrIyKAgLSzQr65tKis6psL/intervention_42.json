And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So, the question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the friend had a hanging nail and clipped it because she had the clippers. Then coworker B overheard, got upset, and told her not to do it. The friend then clipped two more nails to \"even things out.\" After that, coworker B texted her, upset about the noise and considering it gross. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nNow, the main points to consider here. Nail clipping at work is a common debate. Some people find it gross, others don't. The key factors might be company policies, workplace norms, and whether it's causing a disturbance.\n\nThe friend was in her own cubicle, so she's in her personal space. But cubicles aren't completely soundproof, so the noise might carry. The coworker B heard it from over 100 feet away, which is a long distance. That might be unusual, but if the noise is disturbing someone, that's an issue. Also, the friend clipped three nails, not just the one that was hanging. That might be seen as unnecessary.\n\nWorkplace etiquette usually suggests that personal grooming should be done in a way that doesn't disturb others. Clipping nails in a private area might be acceptable, but if the sound is bothersome, it could be an issue. However, it's also about mutual respect. If coworker B is overly sensitive, that's their problem, but the friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive.\n\nThe friend did clip her nails in her cubicle, which is a semi-private space. But if the action is causing discomfort to others, even if unintentionally, there's a responsibility to consider others. The fact that she clipped two more after being told might be seen as defiant or not taking the coworker's feelings into account. However, the initial act was to fix a problem (hanging nail), which is practical.\n\nIn some workplaces, there are specific rules about personal grooming. If there are no such rules, it's more about common courtesy. The friend might not be in the wrong if it's a personal choice and not against company policy. However, the way she responded and the fact that she continued after being asked could tip the scales.\n\nSo, considering all that, it's a bit of a toss-up. But since the friend was in her own cubicle and the coworker was being overly critical, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the act of clipping three nails and the dismissive response might make her partially at fault.\n"
