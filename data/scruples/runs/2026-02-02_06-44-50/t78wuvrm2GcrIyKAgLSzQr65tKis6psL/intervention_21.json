And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author (the friend) is in the wrong here. So the situation is about clipping nails at work. The friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. Then coworker B overheard her comment and got upset, telling her not to do it because it's disgusting. The friend then clipped more nails and got a text from coworker B being upset again. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Is clipping nails at work generally acceptable? Some people might find it gross because of the sound or the mess, while others think it's a normal activity. It's similar to other personal grooming tasks. But maybe in a professional setting, it's better to do it before or after work to avoid disturbing others.\n\nThen there's the friend's reaction of clipping more nails after being told to stop. That could be seen as defiant or not taking the coworker's feelings into account. Even if the friend didn't think it was a big deal, escalating the situation by doing more might be the problem here. Also, responding with \"chill out\" could be dismissive of coworker B's discomfort.\n\nBut coworker B's reaction is also intense. Maybe they have a sensitivity to sounds or are overreacting. The friend's initial action was minor, but the follow-up actions (clipping more after being asked) might be the issue. The key is whether the friend respected the coworker's request and the workplace environment.\n\nWorkplace etiquette often involves being considerate of others. If someone finds an activity disturbing, the person doing it should probably avoid it in common areas. So the friend might be in the wrong for continuing after being asked and for the dismissive response. However, if coworker B is being overly sensitive, maybe the friend isn't entirely at fault. But generally, the friend's actions after the initial request are problematic. So the answer is likely A: Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
