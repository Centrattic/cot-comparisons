And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that the friend had a hanging nail and used clippers in her cubicle. A coworker walked in, told her not to do it because it's disgusting, and later complained again via text. The friend then clipped two more nails to even them out and told the coworker to \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider office etiquette. Clipping nails at work can be a sensitive topic. Some people might find it gross because they associate it with poor hygiene or something unseemly in a professional setting. Others might think it's a practical thing to do if you have a long nail or it's necessary.\n\nThe friend's actions: she clipped a hanging nail, then two more to even them out. That's understandable if she needed to. But doing it in her cubicle might be an issue if the sound is bothersome. The coworker was over 100 feet away and still heard it, which seems like it was really loud or the clippers were making a lot of noise.\n\nCoworker B's reaction seems strong. They confronted the friend in person and then sent a text. The friend's response was \"chill out,\" which might come off as dismissive. That could be seen as the friend not respecting the coworker's feelings. So maybe the friend wasn't wrong in clipping the nails, but her response was inappropriate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the friend was justified because she was doing something personal in her own space. But cubicles aren't entirely private, so maybe there's an expectation of maintaining a certain environment. If the sound is distracting or off-putting, even in a cubicle, it could be an issue.\n\nAlso, the act of clipping two more nails after being told might be seen as defying the coworker's request. So even if she needed to clip the first one, doing two more could be seen as unnecessary, especially if the coworker was upset.\n\nSo the question is whether the friend is the asshole. The options are A or B. The user is asking if the author (the friend) is in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of office norms, it's often considered unprofessional to clip nails in shared workspaces, so maybe the friend was wrong. But some might argue it's a personal thing. The key points are the reaction of the coworker and the friend's response. The friend's \"chill out\" could be seen as dismissive, which is unkind. But maybe the initial act isn't wrong if done discreetly.\n\nBut the problem here is that Coworker B was clearly upset and heard the clippers from far away. The friend's actions might have been inconsiderate because even in a cubicle, the sound can travel. So maybe the author is in the wrong. But then again, if she had a medical reason or just needed to take care of a nail issue, it's less clear.\n\nI think the consensus might be that clipping nails at work is generally frowned upon, so the author is in the wrong. Therefore, answer A.\n"
