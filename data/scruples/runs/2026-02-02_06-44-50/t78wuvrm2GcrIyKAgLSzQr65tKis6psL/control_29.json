And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the friend who clipped her nails at work is in the wrong. The story says she had a hanging nail and used clippers. Coworker B overheard her comment, got upset, and told her not to do it. Then the friend clipped more nails, and Coworker B got even more upset because she could hear it from far away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Clipping nails at work isn't unheard of, but it can be seen as unhygienic or distracting. Some people might find the sound annoying. The friend's initial action was probably fine, but when she clipped two more nails after Coworker B's complaint, that might be overstepping. She knew someone was bothered by it, yet she continued, even making a point to \"even things out.\" That shows she didn't consider the coworker's feelings after the first complaint. \n\nThe response of \"chill out\" is dismissive. That could escalate tensions because it doesn't acknowledge the other person's discomfort. The key points here are the continuation after being told not to and the dismissive reply. So, while the initial action might be debatable, the follow-up actions definitely show a lack of consideration. So the friend might be in the wrong because she acted after being asked to stop and responded in a way that didn't address the concern.\n"
