And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend in the story) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The story says that the friend had a hanging nail and used clippers to fix it. Then another coworker overheard and got upset, telling her not to do it because it's disgusting. The friend then clipped two more nails, and the coworker texted her to say it's gross and that she could hear it from far away. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace etiquette. Clipping nails is generally something people do at home, but maybe some people do it at work if needed. However, it can be considered distracting or unhygienic by some. The coworker B seems very upset, which might be a reaction to the sound or the act itself. The friend clipped more nails after the initial correction, which could be seen as ignoring the coworker's request, leading to more irritation.\n\nThen there's the response \"chill out.\" That's dismissive and might not address the coworker's concerns. The friend might not realize how disruptive it is. But also, coworkers should consider each other's sensitivities. Maybe the friend didn't do anything wrong, but maybe she should have been more considerate of others' feelings. It's a bit of a gray area.\n\nWorkplace policies might matter here too. If there's a rule against certain activities, but if not, it's more about mutual respect. The key points are whether the action is unreasonably disruptive and if the friend showed disregard after being asked. Since she continued after being told to stop, that's probably where the issue lies. So the author might be in the wrong for continuing, even if the initial act wasn't. The answer might be A.\n"
