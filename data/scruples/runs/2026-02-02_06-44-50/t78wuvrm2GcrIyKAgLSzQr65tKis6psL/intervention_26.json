And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for clipping their nails at work. The scenario involves a friend who clipped a nail when she noticed a coworker heard and disapproved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around nail clipping in the workplace. Some people might find it gross because of the sounds or the idea of cutting nails in public spaces. Others might think it's fine if done discreetly. The coworker was clearly bothered by it, even to the point of confronting her and sending a text. \n\nThe friend then clipped two more nails, possibly making it worse. The response \"chill out\" might have been dismissive. The key points are whether the action is unhygienic, disruptive, or against workplace policies. If the workplace has rules against such things, then the friend is wrong. But if there's no policy, it's more a matter of personal discomfort.\n\nHowever, even without explicit rules, common courtesy might suggest that doing something others find gross, especially when it's audible over a distance, could be considered rude. The coworker's reaction is valid if it's affecting her comfort. The friend's actions continued despite the coworker's objection, which is problematic. So maybe the friend is wrong because they didn't respect the coworker's feelings after being made aware of them.\n\nOn the other hand, clipping a single nail might be necessary for hygiene, but doing multiple in response to a complaint could be seen as defiance. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might not be appropriate if the coworker is genuinely upset. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she continued the behavior after being told it's disturbing, and the workplace is a shared space where considering others' comfort is important.\n"
