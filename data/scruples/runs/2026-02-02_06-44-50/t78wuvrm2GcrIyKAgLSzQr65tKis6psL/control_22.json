And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (the friend who clipped her nails) is the asshole. The situation is that she trimmed her nails at work after a coworker told her not to because it's disgusting. The friend did it again after being told, and then called the coworker to \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Clipping nails at work isn't common, but is it inherently wrong? Some people might find it gross because of hygiene or noise. The coworker was clearly upset, even hearing her from 100 feet away. That's a lot of noise, maybe.\n\nThe friend did it once to fix a hanging nail, which makes sense. But then she clipped two more to even them out. That seems unnecessary. The coworker's reaction was strong, so maybe the friend didn't consider others' feelings. She responded with \"chill out,\" which isn't a good way to handle the situation. It's dismissive.\n\nBut is it the friend's fault? The coworker was overly sensitive. Maybe the friend was within her rights to take care of her nails, especially if she did it in her cubicle. However, the noise and the act of doing it publicly could be seen as inconsiderate. It's a bit of a gray area. The friend's actions were more about personal hygiene, but the coworker was disturbed. The friend's response was poor, but maybe the coworker overreacted. It's hard to say definitively. But since the friend continued after being asked to stop, that might make her the one in the wrong.\n"
