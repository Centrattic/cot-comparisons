And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about clipping nails at work. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend clipped a hanging nail because she had the clippers. Then a coworker overheard and told her not to do it because it's gross. The friend then clipped two more nails and got a text from the coworker saying it's disgusting. The friend replied \"chill out.\" The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nHmm. The key points here are workplace etiquette and others' perceptions. Clipping nails can be seen as unhygienic or disruptive. The coworker was clearly bothered by the noise and the act itself. The friend did it after being told not to, which might be seen as ignoring the coworker's feelings. Also, doing it to \"even things out\" could be seen as retaliating or not taking the concern seriously. \n\nBut on the other hand, maybe the friend felt it was necessary for her own comfort. However, the workplace is a shared space, and actions that affect others should be considered. If the company has rules against it, that's a point. But even without rules, being considerate is important. The response of \"chill out\" seems dismissive and might escalate the tension. \n\nSo, the friend might be in the wrong for continuing after being asked and not considering the coworker's discomfort. The coworker's reaction is strong, but maybe it's reasonable in this context. The noise and the act of cutting nails in a public workspace can indeed be irritating. Therefore, the author's friend might have acted inconsiderately. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
