And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that she had a hanging nail and used her clippers, then clipped two more to even them out. Coworker B got upset, saying it was disgusting and heard her from 100 feet away. She responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Clipping nails at work isn't typically a huge issue, but maybe in some environments it's frowned upon. The key points here are that Coworker B overheard her talking about the nail and then came in to tell her not to do it. Then the friend clipped more nails, which Coworker B apparently heard and was upset about.\n\nThe friend might not be in the wrong because she had a reason to clip a hanging nail, which can be uncomfortable. Using clippers in a private cubicle isn't necessarily a problem. However, the act of clipping nails can be noisy and might be considered unhygienic or distracting if someone is close by. The response \"chill out\" could be seen as dismissive, which might escalate the situation.\n\nWorkplace etiquette often depends on the company's culture. If the office is quiet and people expect a low-noise environment, the sound of clippers could be an issue. But if Coworker B is being overly sensitive, then the friend isn't at fault. Also, the friend didn't do it in a common area but in her own cubicle, which is more private.\n\nThe debate here is between personal hygiene needs versus respecting others' comfort. The friend had a valid reason for clipping the nail, but maybe she should have done it at a time or place where it's less disruptive. However, Coworker B's reaction seems extreme, especially since she heard from 100 feet away. That might be an exaggeration or the coworker is being unnecessarily harsh.\n\nSo, considering all that, the friend isn't necessarily in the wrong. She addressed a personal hygiene issue in a private space and didn't cause harm. Coworker B's reaction might be the bigger issue here. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
