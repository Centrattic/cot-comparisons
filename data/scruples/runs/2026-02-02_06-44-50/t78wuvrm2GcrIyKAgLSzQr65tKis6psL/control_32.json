And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the friend (the author's friend) was in the wrong here. So, the situation is about clipping nails at work. The friend had a hanging nail and used clippers, which a coworker, Coworker B, overheard and got upset. Then the friend clipped more nails, and Coworker B was even more annoyed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If the workplace has a rule against certain personal grooming activities, that might be a factor. But the problem didn't mention any specific policy, so maybe that's not it. \n\nNext, the context. Clipping nails can be messy, maybe create noise, or be considered unhygienic by some people. The friend clipped in her cubicle, so maybe it's a private area, but Coworker B could still hear from far away. The sound of clippers might be disturbing to others, especially if it's loud or frequent. Also, the fact that the friend clipped more nails after the initial one to \"even things out\" might come off as defiant, especially after Coworker B explicitly asked her not to.\n\nSocial norms play a role. In many workplaces, clipping nails is considered unprofessional or unhygienic. Even if done in a private space, the noise can travel and annoy others. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might not be the best way to de-escalate the situation. It could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful towards Coworker B's feelings.\n\nHowever, the friend's actions were in response to a personal need. A hanging nail can be uncomfortable, and using clippers quickly might be necessary. The friend might not have realized the disturbance it was causing until Coworker B pointed it out. The key here is whether the friend was considerate of others. Since Coworker B was clearly upset, the friend might not have been mindful of the noise or others' sensitivities.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both sides might have some points. But the friend continued the action after being asked to stop, which is a problem. The initial clipping might be understandable, but doing more after a complaint shows a lack of consideration. The response \"chill out\" could be seen as the friend being dismissive, which might make her the asshole in the eyes of some.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the friend's actions after the initial clipping, and her response to the coworker's request, likely make her at fault here. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
