They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A due to their donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The situation involves the author's in-laws, who are conservatives, visiting and wanting to treat everyone to lunch at Chick-fil-A. The author explains their stance, which leads to some tension with the in-laws. The wife made jokes about the author's liberal views, and even though the author let the son eat the food, they refused themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has a moral or ethical reason for not supporting Chick-fil-A. They explained their position to the in-laws, which is good because it shows they tried to be respectful. However, the in-laws might not agree with the author's stance, which could lead to conflict. The question is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing their beliefs over family harmony in this case.\n\nOn one hand, standing by your beliefs is important, especially when they relate to important social issues. The author isn't forcing others, just themselves, which is a personal choice. On the other hand, the situation caused awkwardness during the family visit, and the author partially gave in by letting their son eat the food. The in-laws were excited about the lunch, so the refusal might have disappointed them. However, the author's wife made jokes about their views, which might indicate some level of disagreement within the family as well.\n\nThe answer likely hinges on whether the author's action was reasonable given their values and how they handled the situation. They did communicate their reasons and compromised by allowing the son to eat the food, which shows they tried to balance their principles with family dynamics. Since the author isn't imposing their views on others but is standing by their own, it's more about personal choice rather than wrongdoing. So the answer should be B, not in the wrong.\n"
