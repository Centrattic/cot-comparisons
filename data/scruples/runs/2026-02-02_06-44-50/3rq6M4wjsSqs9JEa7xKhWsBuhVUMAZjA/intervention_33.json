They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author refused to eat at Chick-fil-A because of the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The mother-in-law was excited to eat there and wanted to treat everyone, including the author's family. The author explained their reasons, but the in-laws still found it odd and made jokes about the author's liberalism. The author let their son eat the food but refused themselves. Now the author is asking if they're the asshole for making the lunch awkward or if they're standing up for their convictions.\n\nHmm. First, I should consider the author's reasoning. They have a moral stance against supporting companies that donate to anti-LGBTQ groups. That's a valid personal belief. People often choose not to support businesses based on their values, especially on social issues. So, from that angle, the author isn't wrong for having those convictions.\n\nBut then there's the family aspect. The mother-in-law was looking forward to this, and the author's refusal caused some awkwardness. The in-laws made jokes about the author's liberalism, which could indicate a clash in values. However, the author didn't force anyone else to not eat there; they let their son eat the food. That shows some compromise. The author is standing by their beliefs but also allowing their child to have the meal, which might balance things out.\n\nI wonder if the problem is more about the social dynamics than the actual decision. The author might feel like they're causing tension, but if they're consistent in their values, that's their right. The in-laws' reaction (making jokes) might be more about their own discomfort or differing views rather than the author's actions being inherently wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled the situation differently. Perhaps they could have found another restaurant to accommodate both their values and the in-laws' wishes, but that's speculative. The key point is whether the author is in the wrong for their stance and actions. Since the author isn't forcing others and is explaining their reasoning, it seems like they're within their rights. The in-laws' judgment doesn't necessarily make the author an asshole; it's about mutual respect and understanding differing perspectives.\n"
