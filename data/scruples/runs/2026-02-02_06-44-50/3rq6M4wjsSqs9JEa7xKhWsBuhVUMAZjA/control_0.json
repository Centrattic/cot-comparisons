They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for refusing to eat Chick-fil-A because of the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The in-laws wanted to treat everyone to lunch, but the author declined due to their stance. The mother-in-law was taken aback, the author explained their reasons, and even had to explain LGBTQ terms. The family then went without the author, and the author allowed their son to eat the food but not themselves.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning is based on supporting their values against anti-LGBTQ groups. That's a personal choice, and many people hold strong convictions about supporting or boycotting businesses based on their values. However, the situation involves family dynamics and the in-laws' expectations. The author might be seen as causing discomfort during a family visit by not compromising. The mother-in-law was excited about the lunch, which the author's refusal might have spoiled. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is standing by their beliefs, which is a valid right. The in-laws' jokes about the author's liberal ideologies suggest a possible clash in values, but the author's refusal isn't necessarily wrong if it's based on personal ethics. Allowing the son to eat the food while they don't might be seen as a middle ground, not entirely refusing to participate but still holding the line. \n\nThe key points are the author's right to their convictions versus the impact on family relations. There's no one-size-fits-all answer here. However, AITA often weighs intent and harm. The author intended to act according to their values, not to harm family relations, but the refusal did cause some awkwardness. Still, the author isn't in the wrong for adhering to their beliefs, especially since it's a personal choice and the in-laws were informed beforehand. The in-laws might have needed to understand or respect differing viewpoints better. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
