They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves their mother-in-law wanting to treat the family to Chick-fil-A, but the author refuses because they don't support the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The key points here are the refusal based on personal beliefs, the conversation that follows, and the eventual compromise where the son eats the food but the author doesn't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal boundaries and values. The author has a right to make their own choices based on their beliefs, especially regarding supporting companies aligned with anti-LGBTQ causes. That's a valid stance for many people. However, the context includes family dynamics and potential social awkwardness. The mother-in-law was excited and wanted to treat everyone, which the author's refusal disrupted. The author's explanation might have been a good attempt to educate, but the mother-in-law's reaction suggests a cultural or generational gap in understanding LGBTQ issues.\n\nThe author then allows their son to eat the food, which might be seen as a compromise. However, the mother-in-law and other in-laws made jokes about the author's liberal views, indicating possible tension. The author's decision to refuse is about their own values, but it affected family plans, which could be seen as causing discomfort. \n\nOn one hand, standing by one's convictions is important. On the other, respecting family wishes and maintaining harmony might be equally important. The question is whether the author was being reasonable. Since they allowed their son to eat and didn't force others to change their plans, maybe they aren't entirely at fault. But if the refusal was seen as dismissive or causing unnecessary conflict, that could be the issue. \n\nThe answer likely hinges on whether the author's actions were respectful. They explained their reasoning and compromised. However, the in-laws felt it was odd, which might indicate that the author's stance wasn't communicated in a way that minimized hurt feelings. But the author isn't obligated to conform to family's choices. So, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong for sticking to their values, even if it created some awkwardness.\n"
