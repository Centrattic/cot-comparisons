They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about refusing to eat Chick-fil-A because of their donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The in-laws, especially the mother-in-law, were excited to eat there and wanted to treat the family. The author explains their reasons, but the in-laws found it odd and made jokes. The author let their son eat the food but refused themselves.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author is the asshole. The key points are about personal convictions versus family dynamics. The author has a valid reason for not supporting Chick-fil-A based on their donations. It's a personal choice related to values and ethics. On the other hand, the in-laws were looking forward to this lunch as a family activity, and the author's refusal might have caused some awkwardness.\n\nBut the author did partially compromise by letting their son eat the food. That shows some flexibility. The mother-in-law was informed and respected the author's stance. However, the in-laws made jokes about the author's liberal ideologies, which could be a red flag. The author's actions might have been firm in their beliefs, but maybe there's a way to handle it more diplomatically without causing tension.\n\nBut is the author the asshole here? Well, the author isn't forcing others; they just refused to eat there. They explained their reasoning, which is reasonable. The in-laws' reactions might be part of their own views, but the author isn't obligated to ignore their convictions. It's their right to support or boycott businesses based on their values. The compromise with the son also shows consideration. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B, not the author.\n"
