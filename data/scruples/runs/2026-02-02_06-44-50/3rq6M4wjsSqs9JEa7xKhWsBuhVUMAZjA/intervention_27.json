They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat Chick-fil-A during their in-laws' visit. The in-laws are described as semi-religious, moderate conservatives. The mother-in-law was excited to visit the Chick-fil-A near the author's home and wanted to treat everyone to lunch. The author refused because of the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. They explained this, which led to some family tension. The wife and in-laws made jokes about the author's liberal views when they were away. The author eventually let their son eat the food but refused themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's refusal is based on personal convictions regarding supporting companies that donate to anti-LGBTQ groups. That's a valid stance for many people. However, the situation involves family gatherings, which often require some compromise. The in-laws were looking forward to this meal, and the author's refusal might have been seen as causing awkwardness. \n\nThe key points are: the author's right to their beliefs versus the impact on family relations. The author explains their reasoning, which shows they tried to be respectful. The in-laws might not share the same views, so there's a clash of values. However, the author allowed their son to eat the food, which shows some flexibility. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If we consider the context of a family meal where the in-laws were anticipating it, the author's refusal might be seen as prioritizing their personal beliefs over family harmony. But if the author's stance is about standing by their convictions, that's a moral choice. The answer might depend on cultural and personal values. In some perspectives, respecting personal beliefs is important, while others might prioritize family gatherings. \n\nThe user mentioned that the author's wife and in-laws made jokes about their liberal views, which adds a layer of tension. The author's refusal could be a way to assert their values in the face of being mocked. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for holding their beliefs. However, the situation might have been handled differently to avoid awkwardness. But the question is whether they're in the wrong, not whether they could have handled it better. Since their reasoning is based on ethical concerns and they tried to explain it respectfully, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue that in a family setting, compromise is expected. It's a bit of a gray area, but given the explanation and the allowance for the son, B seems plausible.\n"
