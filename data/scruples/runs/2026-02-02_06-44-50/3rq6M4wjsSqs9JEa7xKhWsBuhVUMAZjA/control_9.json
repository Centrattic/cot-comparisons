They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is the asshole in this situation. The scenario involves the author refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups, which causes tension with their in-laws.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid reason based on their values. Supporting or not supporting certain companies over their policies is a common personal choice. On the other hand, the in-laws were excited about the meal and the author's refusal might have made them feel awkward.\n\nThe author's mother-in-law asked questions and tried to understand, which shows she was respectful. The author explained their stance, which is important. However, when the in-laws left to get the food, there were jokes about the author's liberal views. That's a bit concerning because it's not respectful to mock someone's beliefs, even if it's in minor ways.\n\nThe author allowed their son to eat the food but refused themselves. That could be seen as a compromise, but maybe they could have handled it differently. Perhaps they could have suggested an alternative restaurant to avoid the conflict. But the author had a right to stand by their convictions. \n\nIn-laws visiting from a small town might have different perspectives, so maybe the author could have been more considerate of their feelings. However, the author's values are their own, and it's not wrong to have them. The key here is whether refusing to eat at that restaurant was unreasonable. Since the author had a clear reason and communicated it respectfully, they might not be in the wrong. \n\nThe in-laws also chose to make jokes, which contributed to the awkwardness. The author's actions were based on personal ethics, which is a defensible stance. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
