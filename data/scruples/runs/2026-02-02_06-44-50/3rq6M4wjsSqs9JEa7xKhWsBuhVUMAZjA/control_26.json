They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. Their in-laws, who are moderate conservatives from a small town, were excited to go there and wanted to treat everyone to lunch. The user explained their reasons, which led to the in-laws pressing them to ignore their convictions and eat with the family. The user let their son have the food but refused themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The user is standing by their personal values, which is their right. But they're also causing some awkwardness in the family setting. The in-laws might not understand or agree with the stance, but that doesn't necessarily make the user wrong. The key points here are personal beliefs vs. family dynamics. \n\nChick-fil-A's support of anti-LGBTQ causes is a real issue, and many people choose not to support businesses based on their values. The user is being honest about their reasons, which is respectful. The in-laws were taken aback, but the user didn't force them to stop; they just refused to participate. Allowing the son to eat the food is a compromise, so they're not entirely rigid. \n\nThe wife's reaction with minor jokes might add to the tension, but the user's actions are based on their own convictions. Letting the son eat the food could be seen as a middle ground. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong for holding their beliefs. The argument is whether personal ethics should override family preferences. Since the user is not being hostile and is making a choice based on their values, and there's no indication of malicious intent, they aren't the asshole. Answer B.\n"
