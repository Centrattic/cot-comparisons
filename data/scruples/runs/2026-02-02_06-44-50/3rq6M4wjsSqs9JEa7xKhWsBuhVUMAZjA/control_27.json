They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of their donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The mother-in-law was excited to go there and wanted to treat everyone to lunch. The author explained their stance and ended up only letting their son eat the food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author has a personal conviction against supporting a business associated with anti-LGBTQ causes. That's a valid personal choice, especially regarding supporting businesses based on their values. On the other hand, the in-laws were looking forward to this meal, and the author's refusal caused some awkwardness. The wife and in-laws made jokes about the author's liberal views, which might have added to the tension.\n\nThe key points here are personal values versus family dynamics. The author isn't forcing anyone else to not eat there; they just declined themselves. They even allowed their son to eat the food, which shows some compromise. The mother-in-law was initially taken aback but the author explained their reasons respectfully. The wife's reaction might have been a result of the situation, but it's not the author's fault that the in-laws made jokes.\n\nIs it wrong to hold personal values that affect family gatherings? It depends on the context. The author didn't prevent the family from going to the restaurant or eating there themselves. They made their choice and communicated it respectfully. The awkwardness came from the clash of values and the in-laws' expectations, not necessarily the author's refusal itself. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have handled it more diplomatically. Explaining the reasons in a more detailed or sensitive way might have helped the in-laws understand better. But the author did explain and compromise by letting the son eat the food, which shows they considered family feelings. \n\nSo, in the end, the author's actions stem from their personal beliefs and they tried to find a middle ground. Therefore, they aren't in the wrong just for holding their convictions, even if it caused some discomfort.\n"
