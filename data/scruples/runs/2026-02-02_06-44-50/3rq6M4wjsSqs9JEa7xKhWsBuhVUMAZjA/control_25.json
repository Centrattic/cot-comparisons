They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about refusing to eat Chick-fil-A because of the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The in-laws, who are religious conservatives, wanted to treat everyone to lunch, but the author refused to eat there. The mother-in-law was upset, and the wife made jokes about the author's liberalism. The author then let their son eat the food but not themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is standing by their values, which is about supporting LGBTQ rights. Chick-fil-A has been known for donating to groups that oppose LGBTQ rights, so the author's stance is based on their personal beliefs. On the other hand, the in-laws were excited for this lunch, and the author's refusal might have caused tension in the family.\n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The author is refusing to compromise on their values, but it's causing some awkwardness. The wife's reaction suggests that there's a generational or ideological gap. The author allowed their son to eat the food, which might be a middle ground, but they still refused themselves.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a personal values vs. family harmony issue. The author isn't doing anything illegal or harmful; they're just not supporting a business they disagree with. The in-laws might feel disrespected, but the author isn't forcing anyone else to not eat there. Allowing the son to eat it shows they aren't imposing their views on the kid. \n\nI think the key here is that the author is within their rights to make that choice. They didn't make a scene, explained their reasoning respectfully, and allowed their son to participate. The in-laws were the ones who wanted to treat everyone, but the author can't be forced to support something they disagree with. So the author isn't the asshole. Answer B.\n"
