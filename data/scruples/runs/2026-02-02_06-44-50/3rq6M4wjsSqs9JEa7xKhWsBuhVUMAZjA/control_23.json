They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The mother-in-law was excited to eat there and wanted to treat the family, but the author stood their ground. The wife and in-laws made jokes about the author's liberal views, and the author allowed their son to eat the food but not themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives here. The author's stance is based on personal values and ethical reasons related to supporting certain organizations. On the other hand, the in-laws see this as a family matter and a social event. The author's refusal might have caused discomfort, especially since the mother-in-law was looking forward to it. \n\nThe key points are: the author's right to hold their convictions versus the potential strain on family relationships. The author isn't forcing others to share their views but is making a personal choice. Allowing the son to eat the food shows some compromise. The in-laws' reaction could be due to not understanding the issue, and the wife's comments might be a sign of tension.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and whether the action was unkind. The author's intent was to avoid supporting groups they disagree with, not to offend. Refusing to eat doesn't harm others, but it might have made the in-laws feel disrespected. However, the author did explain their reasoning, which is a responsible step. The fact that the author allowed their son to eat shows they aren't imposing their views on the family.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. But typically, people are encouraged to stand by their values unless it's causing significant harm. The author isn't being malicious; they're making a principled choice. The in-laws' reaction is more about cultural or generational differences. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
