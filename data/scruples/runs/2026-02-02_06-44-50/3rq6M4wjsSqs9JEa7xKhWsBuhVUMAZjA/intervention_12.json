They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's in-laws are semi-religious, moderate conservatives. The mother-in-law was excited to eat at Chick-fil-A, which is nearby, and wanted to treat the family to lunch. The author refused because of the company's support for anti-LGBTQ organizations. The in-laws were surprised, and after some back and forth, the author reluctantly allowed their son to eat the food but not themselves. The wife also made jokes about the author's liberal views.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take. I need to decide if the author is the asshole here. The key points are personal beliefs vs. family harmony. The author is standing by their convictions, which is a personal choice. However, causing discomfort in the family setting might be an issue. On the other hand, the author isn't forcing others to share their views; they allowed their son to eat. The in-laws might not have considered the author's stance beforehand. \n\nIs it wrong to hold personal values that affect family interactions? Maybe not. People have different priorities. The author's refusal isn't about being rude but about their principles. The in-laws might not have been aware of the controversy, so the author's explanation was necessary. The wife's jokes suggest some tension, but the author isn't causing harm by not eating the food. \n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They're choosing to act according to their beliefs without forcing others to do the same. The real issue is the family's reaction, not the author's decision. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
