They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A due to the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The in-laws, especially the mother-in-law, were looking forward to treating everyone to lunch there. The author explains their stance, but the family still finds it odd, and the author ends up letting their son eat the food but not themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's decision is based on personal ethics regarding the company's support of certain organizations. They tried to explain their reasoning, which shows they tried to be respectful. The mother-in-law was surprised and perhaps not fully aware of the company's stance before, so the author's explanation might have been necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, the in-laws were looking forward to this lunch, and the author's refusal might have caused some awkwardness. However, the author did compromise by allowing their son to eat the food, which shows some flexibility. The question is whether the author is wrong for standing by their convictions or if they should have just gone along with the family's plans.\n\nPersonal beliefs and ethical stances are important, and people have the right to make choices based on their values. However, in a family setting, balancing personal beliefs with family harmony can be tricky. The author tried to communicate their reasons respectfully, which is a good step. The mother-in-law's reaction and the wife's jokes suggest there might be a generational or ideological gap, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether standing by one's convictions in a situation where it causes some family tension is considered being in the wrong. Since the author made an effort to explain and compromise, it's more likely that they are not in the wrong. The key factors are respect, clear communication, and the willingness to find a middle ground, which the author demonstrated.\n"
