They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole (AITA) for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of its donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The author's mother-in-law wanted to treat the family to lunch at that restaurant, and the author explained their reasons for not supporting it. The in-laws made some jokes about the author's liberal views, and the author let their son eat the food but refused themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author has a right to their convictions and to make personal choices based on their values. Supporting LGBTQ rights is important to many, and choosing not to support businesses that fund anti-LGBTQ groups is a common stance. However, the author's decision might have caused discomfort for the family, especially the mother-in-law who was excited about the outing. \n\nThe author did explain their reasoning, which shows respect for the in-laws' perspective. The in-laws also pressed for more information, which could indicate they were trying to understand. The author partially compromised by allowing the son to eat the food, which shows consideration for the child. \n\nOn the other hand, the situation might have been handled more smoothly if the author considered alternative solutions, like finding a different restaurant or discussing the issue before the lunch plans were set. But the author's main point is standing by their beliefs, which is a valid choice. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were inconsiderate. While the author's stance is understandable, causing family tension over a meal might come across as stubborn or inflexible. However, the author isn't in the wrong for having those beliefs. There's no indication of malice or disrespect. The in-laws also made jokes about the author's views, which might contribute to the tension. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't the asshole for holding their values. The situation is a clash of values, but the author's actions were respectful and they made a compromise. So the answer should be B.\n"
