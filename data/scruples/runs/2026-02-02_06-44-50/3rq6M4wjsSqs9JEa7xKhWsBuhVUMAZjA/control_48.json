They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A due to the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The in-laws were excited to get lunch there, and the author explained their stance. The mother-in-law even asked for clarification on the donations and the LGBTQ part. The author then refused to eat but allowed their son to have the food. The wife and in-laws found this odd and made jokes about the author's liberalism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has a valid reason for their stance\u2014personal ethics against supporting companies linked to discriminatory practices. Standing by one's beliefs is important, especially on issues of social justice. Allowing the child to eat the food might be seen as a compromise, which is reasonable to maintain family harmony without fully compromising personal values. \n\nThe mother-in-law and spouse's reactions\u2014being taken aback and making jokes\u2014suggest they might not fully understand or agree with the author's perspective. However, the author communicated their reasons respectfully and even made a concession by letting their son eat the food. The main conflict arises from differing values and the social awkwardness of the situation. \n\nIn such cases, it's common for people to clash when personal ethics meet family traditions. The author isn't causing harm by refusing to eat there; they're simply choosing not to support a company's practices they disagree with. The fact that they allowed their son to eat the food shows flexibility. The in-laws' discomfort stems from their own expectations versus the author's values. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong for standing by their convictions while making a compromise. The answer should be B.\n"
