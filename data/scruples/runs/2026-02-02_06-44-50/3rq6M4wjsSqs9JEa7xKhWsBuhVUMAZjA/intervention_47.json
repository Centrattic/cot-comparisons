They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The author's mother-in-law (MiL) was excited to visit and wanted to treat everyone to lunch there. The author explained their stance, but the MiL found it odd and made minor jokes about their liberal views. The author ended up letting their son eat the food but refused themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author has a right to their personal beliefs and values. Supporting or boycotting a company based on their donations is a common practice, especially for those who are conscious of where their money goes. The author isn't forcing anyone else to eat there; they just choose not to participate. That seems like a personal choice and a valid stance.\n\nOn the other hand, the MiL was looking forward to this meal as part of her visit. The author's refusal might have caused some awkwardness or hurt feelings, especially since it was her idea to go there and treat everyone. The MiL's reaction and the spouse's jokes suggest that this might have been a sensitive topic in the household, possibly leading to tension.\n\nBut is the author at fault? They communicated their reasons respectfully and allowed their son to eat the food, which shows they weren't entirely rigid. The key here is whether the author overstepped by refusing a meal that was meant to be a family bonding experience. However, personal convictions about supporting certain organizations are a significant value for many people. The author isn't being disrespectful; they're standing by their beliefs, even if it caused some discomfort. \n\nIt's important to note that the author didn't make a scene or belittle the MiL's choice. They explained their stance, which is a mature approach. The MiL's discomfort and the spouse's jokes might indicate that the issue lies more with how the family handles differing opinions rather than the author's refusal itself. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong for upholding their values. They made a thoughtful decision that respects their beliefs while still allowing their child to enjoy the meal. The tension arose from differing family dynamics and how they handle such issues, not from the author's refusal per se.\n"
