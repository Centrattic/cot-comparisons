They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The author is someone who is in a family where their in-laws are visiting from a small town. The mother-in-law was really excited to eat at Chick-fil-A, which is nearby. The author refuses to eat there because they don't support the organizations Chick-fil-A donates to, specifically anti-LGBTQ groups. They explain this to their in-laws, which leads to a discussion where the author has to explain what LGBTQ means. The in-laws then ask them to ignore their personal beliefs and eat with the family. The author ends up letting their son eat the food but refusing themselves. The wife made some jokes about the author's liberal views when the in-laws left.\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's reasoning. They have a moral stance against Chick-fil-A's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups, so refusing to eat there is based on their personal values. Is that a valid reason? Well, people can choose their beliefs and how they spend their money. The author is not forcing others to share their views, just making a personal choice.\n\nNext, the in-laws wanted to treat everyone to lunch. The author's refusal could make the lunch awkward. But the in-laws were the ones who wanted to go there, maybe without knowing the author's stance beforehand. The author did explain their reasoning when asked. The mother-in-law was taken aback but asked respectfully for more info. The author being honest is fair.\n\nThe wife's reaction might be a point. She made minor jokes about the author's liberal ideologies. That's probably a sign that the author's stance is causing some tension in the family, but the question is whether the author is the asshole. The author let their son eat the food, which is a partial compromise. They didn't make the in-laws waste their money or stop their son from having the meal. So maybe the author is standing by their beliefs but being respectful enough to not pressure the in-laws or the child.\n\nBut is it wrong to cause an awkward situation by refusing? The in-laws were excited about the meal. The author could have agreed to eat somewhere else, but they didn't have to go to Chick-fil-A. Since the author explained their reasons and the in-laws still wanted to go there, the author is just being consistent. The real issue might be the in-laws not considering the author's stance when choosing the restaurant. However, the author is the one who said no, even after the in-laws wanted to treat. So maybe the author is in the right by not compromising their values, especially if they made it clear and allowed their son to eat. The jokes from the wife could indicate others are upset, but the author isn't forcing anyone to share their views. Therefore, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
