They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is the asshole (AITA) for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's mother-in-law wanted to treat the family to lunch at Chick-fil-A, which was a big deal for her. The author refused to eat there, explaining their reasons. The in-laws found it odd, made jokes about the author's liberalism, and the author let their son eat the food but not themselves. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about personal convictions versus family expectations. The author is standing by their beliefs, which is a valid stance. The mother-in-law's reaction and the jokes from the in-laws might indicate a clash in values. The author's refusal isn't about being rude but about supporting certain values over others. Letting the son eat the food shows some compromise, but the author still held their ground. \n\nIn AITA situations, people often consider whether the person acted inconsiderately. The author explained their reasons respectfully, so that's a positive. The in-laws might not agree, but the author isn't forcing them to hold those views. The author's actions are about their own values, not imposing on others. The humor from the in-laws is probably the bigger issue here, but the question is about the author's actions. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to their beliefs and made a respectful stand. The in-laws should understand that even if they disagree. So the answer is B.\n"
