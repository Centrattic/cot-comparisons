They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of their donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The in-laws are conservatives who are disappointed because they wanted to treat everyone to lunch. The author explained their reasons and ended up letting their son eat the food but refused themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's main reason is opposing the company's support of anti-LGBTQ groups. The in-laws found this odd and made some jokes about the author's liberal views. The author let their son eat the food, so it's not a complete refusal. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often look for whether the person's actions are reasonable given their values versus respecting family dynamics. The author is standing by their convictions, which is a valid personal choice. However, the situation involves family and a social event, so causing discomfort might be a factor.\n\nBut the author did partially compromise by allowing their son to eat the food, which shows they weren't entirely rigid. The main conflict is between personal ethics and family harmony. The in-laws might not fully understand or agree, but the author isn't forcing anyone. The wife's comments and the in-laws' reactions suggest there's some tension, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong.\n\nSo, considering the author's right to their beliefs and the compromise they made, it's more about differing values rather than being in the wrong. The answer is likely B, not an asshole.\n"
