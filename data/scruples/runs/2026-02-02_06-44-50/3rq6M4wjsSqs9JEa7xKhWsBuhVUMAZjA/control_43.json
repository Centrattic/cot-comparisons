They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat Chick-fil-A due to the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's in-laws are conservative and religious. The mother-in-law was excited to get Chick-fil-A during their visit. The author explains their refusal based on the company's support of anti-LGBTQ groups, which led to a discussion and some tension. The author's wife and in-laws made jokes about the author's \"liberal ideologies,\" and the author let their son eat the food but not themselves.\n\nNow, considering the key points: the author's stance is based on personal ethics regarding supporting companies with certain political donations. The in-laws wanted to treat everyone, but the author's refusal made it awkward. The author also allowed their son to eat the food, which is a partial compromise.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, this is subjective. The author has a right to their beliefs, and it's reasonable to have ethical boundaries. The fact that they allowed their son to eat the food shows some flexibility. However, the situation is sensitive because it involves family dynamics and differing values. The author might be seen as standing up for their values, which is not inherently wrong. On the other hand, refusing the family's choice could cause tension, but the author's explanation seems respectful.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were inconsiderate. They explained their reasons and compromised by letting the son eat the food. The in-laws made jokes about the author's beliefs, which might indicate they were dismissive, but the author's stance remains about their convictions. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
