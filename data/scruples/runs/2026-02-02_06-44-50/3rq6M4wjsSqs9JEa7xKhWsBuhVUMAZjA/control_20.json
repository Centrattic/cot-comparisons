They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A due to the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The in-laws are moderate conservatives and wanted to treat the family to lunch. The author explained their stance, had to define LGBTQ, and the in-laws kept pressing. The wife made some jokes about their liberal views, and the author let their son eat the food but refused themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's decision is based on personal ethics regarding supporting certain organizations. The in-laws' reaction is about feeling awkward and the wife's jokes. The question is whether the author is the asshole for making the lunch awkward or for partially giving in by letting the son eat the food.\n\nIn terms of personal convictions, people have the right to choose where they spend their money, especially based on ethical concerns. However, the social situation might be tricky. The in-laws might not have been aware of these issues, and the author's explanation could have been a cultural divide. The wife's jokes suggest there's some tension, which might be more about the family dynamics than the author's stance itself.\n\nThe author didn't force others to not eat there. They allowed their son to have the food, showing compromise. Refusing to eat themselves is a personal choice, not imposing on others. The awkwardness comes from the family's reaction, not the author's intent. So, it's more about differing values and how they were communicated. The author isn't wrong for standing by their beliefs, especially as they didn't prevent the family from enjoying the meal. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
