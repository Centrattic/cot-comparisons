They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of its donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The in-laws were excited to eat there, and the author explained their reasons. The mother-in-law was taken aback, asked questions, and even made jokes about the author's \"liberal ideologies.\" The author let their son eat the food but refused themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the situation. The author's stance is based on opposing anti-LGBTQ groups, which is a valid personal belief. People have the right to make choices based on their values, even if it affects social interactions. However, the author had to explain LGBTQ terms, which might indicate that the in-laws aren't as informed. The author's refusal could be seen as standing up for personal ethics, but it's possible that the in-laws felt disrespected or that their choice was being judged.\n\nOn the other hand, the in-laws were visiting from a small town, and maybe they didn't expect such a stance. The mother-in-law wanted to treat everyone, so the author's refusal might have caused some awkwardness. But the author did let their son eat the food, so there's some compromise. The wife's comments suggest that the author's position was met with some resistance or teasing, which might have been uncomfortable.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't force anyone else to not eat there. They explained their reasons, which is important for mutual understanding. The key here is whether refusing to eat at a restaurant due to its donations is a legitimate reason. Many people support or oppose companies based on their values, so the author's action isn't inherently wrong. However, in a family setting, causing discomfort could be seen as a downside, but the author tried to respect their own values while allowing their son to eat. \n\nThe answer probably leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is acting on their convictions without imposing on others. The in-laws' reactions don't necessarily make the author wrong; it's about differing values and how to handle them in family dynamics. The author didn't force the in-laws to change their behavior, just their own.\n"
