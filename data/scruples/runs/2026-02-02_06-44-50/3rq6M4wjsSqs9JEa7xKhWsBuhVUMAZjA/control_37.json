They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of its donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The in-laws were visiting, and the mother-in-law was really looking forward to treating everyone to lunch there. The author explained their reasons, but the in-laws still found it odd and made jokes about the author's liberal views. The author then let their son eat the food but refused themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's decision is based on personal ethics regarding supporting companies linked to anti-LGBTQ organizations. On the other hand, the in-laws might feel that the author is overstepping by making a family meal awkward and potentially offending them. The author's compromise allows their son to eat the food but not themselves, which might mitigate some of the conflict.\n\nIs it the author's fault for standing by their beliefs? Well, people have different values, and it's their right to choose where they spend their money based on ethical considerations. However, family dynamics can be tricky. The author did explain their reasons, so it's not like they were being secretive. The in-laws' reaction seems to stem from misunderstanding or differing values, which is common in families with diverse viewpoints.\n\nThe part where the author let the son eat the food shows some flexibility, so they're not entirely rigid. The question is whether making the lunch awkward is the author's fault. It might depend on the family's sensitivity to such issues. The author's actions are about personal ethics, which are valid, but causing discomfort in family settings can be a point of contention.\n\nIn many AITA situations, the line is drawn between personal ethics and social harmony. Here, the author isn't forcing anyone else to share their views; they're just declining to participate. The in-laws' jokes suggest they might not respect the author's stance, which complicates things. But the author isn't necessarily at fault for having different beliefs. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is acting on personal ethics and made a compromise.\n"
