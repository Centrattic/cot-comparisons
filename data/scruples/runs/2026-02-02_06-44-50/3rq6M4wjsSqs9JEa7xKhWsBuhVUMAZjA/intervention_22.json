They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of their donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The in-laws are conservative and wanted to treat the family to lunch there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's stance is based on their personal values and opposition to the company's support of certain groups. They tried to explain their reasons and even let their son eat the food, which shows some compromise. On the other hand, the in-laws were excited about this visit and felt the author was making the lunch awkward. The wife also made jokes about their liberal views, which might indicate some tension.\n\nI should think about whether it's reasonable for someone to decline to support a business based on their values. Many people choose where to spend their money based on ethics or beliefs. The author did explain their reasoning, which is respectful. However, the in-laws might see it as an unnecessary conflict, especially during family time.\n\nAlso, the author let their son eat the food, so it's not a complete refusal. That shows they aren't entirely strict. The question is whether the refusal caused unnecessary awkwardness. It's a personal choice, but maybe the approach could have been more considerate to the in-laws' feelings. But since the author explained their stance and compromised, it's a balance between personal ethics and family harmony.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often weigh personal choices against social expectations. The author isn't being malicious, just standing by their beliefs. The in-laws were taken aback, but the author tried to be respectful. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because they had a valid reason and tried to handle it politely.\n"
