We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the Reddit-style story is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to be involved with a child they didn't plan for.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspects. In many places, when a man is found to be the father, he's legally responsible for child support, right? Even if he doesn't want to be involved. So the idea of a \"financial abortion\" where he wants to disown the child might not be legally possible. He can't just walk away from financial responsibilities once paternity is established.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The user is clear they never wanted kids, which is their personal choice. But once a child is born, there are ethical considerations about supporting it. Some might say it's selfish to not help, while others might argue it's their right to make that choice. However, the mother is keeping the child, so the father's responsibility is a factor here.\n\nThe user's new relationship and stable living situation might add stress, but that's their personal circumstance. The mother's friends are criticizing him, but that's part of the social conflict here. The key points are legal responsibility and moral obligation. Legally, he's probably obligated to pay child support, so wanting to avoid that could make him the asshole in terms of legal duties. Morally, it's a toss-up, but since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the legal side is a strong factor.\n\nSo the answer is probably A, he's in the wrong because legally he can't disown the child and must support it. Morally, it's debatable, but the legal aspect makes him responsible.\n"
