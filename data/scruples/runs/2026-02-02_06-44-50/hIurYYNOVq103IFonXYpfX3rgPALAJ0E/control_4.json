We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion.\" So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author dated someone and then broke up. After months of no contact, the ex reveals she's pregnant. The author is clear he never wants kids and immediately declines to get back together. He's now in a new relationship and moving into a new apartment, which is shaken by this news. He's looking to disengage financially and legally from the child, even if it's not a traditional abortion. The ex's friends are calling him selfish and hurt by his refusal. The question is whether he's in the wrong morally and legally.\n\nLegally, in most places, fathers have to support their children regardless of their agreement. So he can't just walk away from child support. Morally, it's more complex. The author didn't want the child, but by having unprotected sex, even if with precautions, he contributed to the pregnancy. But he's not taking responsibility, which some might see as selfish. On the other hand, he's honest about his inability to be a parent. However, the mother is keeping the child, so he can't force an abortion, but he's not taking on parental duties. So legally, he's probably in trouble for not providing support. Morally, some might argue he's avoiding responsibility, but others might understand his stance if the relationship was over. The ex's friends criticizing him might be valid, as his reaction could be seen as heartless. So the answer could be A (in the wrong) because of legal obligations and moral responsibility, but I need to check the specifics. The user wants a simple A or B. Considering both aspects, the answer is likely A.\n"
