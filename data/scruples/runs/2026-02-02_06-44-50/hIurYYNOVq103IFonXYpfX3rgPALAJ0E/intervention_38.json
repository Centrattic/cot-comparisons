We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The question is about whether it's morally or legally acceptable to avoid financial responsibility for a child they didn't want.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many jurisdictions, parental rights and responsibilities are automatic once paternity is established. Even if the father didn't want the child, once it's proven he's the biological parent, he's usually obligated to provide child support. So legally, he might be required to pay. But he's talking about a \"financial abortion,\" which sounds like a legal way to terminate those responsibilities. However, legally, once the child is born and paternity is confirmed, terminating those rights might be difficult. He might need to go through a legal process, and even then, courts prioritize the child's best interest, which often includes financial support from both parents.\n\nMorally, it's more subjective. The man was clear about not wanting kids, and the breakup was months prior. The woman became pregnant after minimal contact. The man is in a new relationship and feels this is the worst scenario. But the woman is determined to keep the child. Morally, some might argue that he has a responsibility to support his child, regardless of his initial desires. Others might say that since he was explicit about not wanting kids and the pregnancy occurred after a breakup, he shouldn't be forced to support the child. However, the child's well-being is a factor. If the mother can't support the child alone, the father's financial contribution might be necessary.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. The original poster is seeking validation or whether others agree. The answer options are A or B. I need to decide based on both legal and moral angles.\n\nLegally, yes, he's likely obligated to support the child. Morally, opinions vary. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A (yes) because of legal obligations and moral responsibilities towards the child. However, if the man can legally terminate paternity before the child is born, maybe it's different. But in many places, once the child is born, termination of parental rights isn't straightforward. So the author might be legally required to pay, making him in the wrong if he refuses. But if he can legally do it, maybe not. But the situation is that the pregnancy is already confirmed, and the woman is keeping the baby. So the author is in a position where he may have no legal way out, thus making him morally wrong for not supporting the child. So the answer might be A.\n"
