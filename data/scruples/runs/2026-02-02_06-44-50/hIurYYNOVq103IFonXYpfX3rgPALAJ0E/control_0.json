We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user is asking if it's okay for him to refuse any financial or parental responsibilities for a child he didn't want, even though he's the biological father. The key points here are: he was clear about not wanting kids, the relationship broke down months ago, they had a period of no contact, she got pregnant, and he's now in a new relationship with a new home. He wants to disavow all financial and parental responsibilities, which is sometimes called a \"financial abortion.\"\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspects. In most jurisdictions, fathers have legal responsibilities once paternity is established. Even if he doesn't want to be involved, he might still be required to pay child support. So from a legal standpoint, he might be in the wrong if he refuses support without a court's approval, like through a voluntary termination of parental rights, which is rare and has strict conditions. But I'm not 100% sure about the exact legal procedures here.\n\nMoral or ethical considerations are trickier. The user is adamant about not wanting kids and was clear about that. However, he was in a relationship where he engaged in sexual activity, presumably without using 100% effective contraception (since they were \"fairly strict\" but still ended up with a pregnancy). So, he might be seen as responsible for the consequences of his actions. On the other hand, he wasn't in a committed relationship at the time of the pregnancy, and the breakup was months prior. \n\nThe mother is keeping the child, so he's being asked to support a child he didn't plan for. If he refuses support, he's being selfish, but if he's forced to support a child he never wanted, that's also a burden. However, most ethical frameworks would likely hold that once a person is a parent (biologically), they have a responsibility to support the child, even if they didn't plan for it. \n\nThe ex's friends are calling him selfish, which is a moral judgment. Whether that's fair depends on the circumstances. The user's argument is that he was clear about not wanting kids, and the pregnancy happened despite precautions. But he still had a role in the situation, so he might be seen as having some responsibility.\n\nIn terms of legal options, \"financial abortion\" isn't a real term. He might be referring to terminating parental rights. But that's not something he can do unilaterally. The court would need to be convinced that termination is in the child's best interest. If the mother is keeping the child, it's unlikely the court would allow him to walk away without her consent. So legally, he's probably in the wrong for trying to avoid support without proper legal processes.\n\nSo putting it all together, the user might be in the wrong both legally and ethically. He can't unilaterally disavow responsibility, and morally, being a parent (even unintentionally) does bring certain obligations. The answer might be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
