We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who was in a relationship and is now faced with the woman saying she's pregnant with his child. He never wanted kids, they broke up months ago, and he's refusing to be involved in any way, including financial support. His new girlfriend and their new apartment are mentioned, and he's feeling overwhelmed. His ex's friends are calling him selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, a man is legally responsible for child support once paternity is established, even if he didn't want the child. So if tests confirm he's the father, he might have no legal choice but to pay. But some places might allow disclaimers of paternity if he's never acknowledged the child or been part of a relationship where he should have known he could be a father. That part is tricky and depends on local laws.\n\nThen the moral angle. The person is clearly stating he doesn't want to be a parent and wants no contact or responsibilities. But from a moral standpoint, some might argue that he's being selfish and shirking responsibility. Others might say that if the child is born and the mother is capable of raising it, he's not necessarily at fault for not wanting to be involved. However, the fact that they were using contraceptives is a point in his favor, but maybe not if one failed. Contraceptives aren't 100% effective, so that's a factor.\n\nThe ex wants to get back together, which he's rejected. She's determined to keep the baby. He's trying to avoid all responsibilities, which could be seen as morally wrong because the child isn't at fault. But he's also in a new relationship, and the sudden responsibility could severely impact his life. The emotional aspect is significant here; he's freaking out because it's unexpected and he's made his stance clear before.\n\nThe friends accusing him of being selfish\u2014maybe they feel he should take responsibility. But if the mother is the one keeping the child, she's the one responsible for raising it. Still, in many societies, the expectation is that both parents share responsibility, even if not in a relationship.\n\nSo, legally, he might be wrong because he could be obligated to pay child support. Morally, there's a debate: some might see him as being responsible for his actions, while others might empathize with his stance given his prior clarity. The key points are the legal obligations versus personal choice, and the moral responsibility to a child versus personal circumstances.\n\nI think the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because even if he didn't want kids, once paternity is confirmed, he has legal responsibilities. Morally, some would argue responsibility, but the question is about being in the wrong. Legally, he probably is, so the answer would be A.\n"
