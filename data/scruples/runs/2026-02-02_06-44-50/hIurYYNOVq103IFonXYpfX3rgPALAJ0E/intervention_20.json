We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to disclaim all financial and parental responsibilities for a child they didn't want, given the circumstances.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author dated someone for a few months, then there was a breakup with no contact for months. The ex then contacted him to say she's pregnant. The author made it clear he never wanted kids. Now he's in a new relationship, moved into a new place, and is horrified by the news. He wants to completely cut ties, no child support, no custody, etc. He's been called selfish by her friends.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down into legal and moral aspects.\n\nLegally, in most places, a biological father has obligations to a child, especially if paternity is established. Even if the father doesn't want the child, he might still be required to pay child support. Termination of parental rights is usually a complex legal process and not something he can unilaterally decide. So legally, he might not have the option to walk away without consequences. But the post is asking if he's in the wrong, not about the law. However, sometimes what's legal isn't necessarily seen as morally right.\n\nMoral considerations: The author is being called selfish for not wanting to support the child. The mother is keeping the child, so the father's refusal to support could impact the child's well-being. Even if the author didn't want the child, the child is a human being with needs. Some might argue that as a parent, regardless of wanting the child, has a duty to support. Others might argue that the father's wishes were clear and the mother's actions (carrying the child to term despite the breakup) complicate things.\n\nBut then, the author was clear about not wanting children. The mother, despite knowing that, chose to carry the pregnancy. The argument here could be about the mother's responsibility as well. However, the child's well-being is the primary concern. The father's refusal to support could leave the child without resources. So morally, some might say he's in the wrong for not providing support, even if it's not his fault.\n\nHowever, others might sympathize with the author's position. He was in a past relationship where he was clear about his stance on children, and the breakup was months prior. The surprise pregnancy could be seen as a situation where the mother didn't respect his wishes. But ultimately, the child exists now, and the father's responsibility might be seen as non-negotiable.\n\nIn terms of the author's new relationship and life changes, the stress and the impact on his current family might be a factor. But the question is about his wrongness. The author is being called selfish, but is that justified?\n\nConsidering all this, the author's position is legally problematic and morally questionable. Even if he didn't want the child, the child's needs must be met. The author is avoiding responsibility, which many would see as selfish and wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
