We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he was in a relationship, broke up, and then found out the ex is pregnant with his child. He never wanted kids and is now considering a \"financial abortion,\" meaning not paying child support and no contact. \n\nFirst, legally, in most places, you can't just walk away from a child you fathered. Even if you don't want to be involved, you're responsible for child support. The law usually requires both parents to support their child financially. So he can't just resign his rights without the mother's consent and a legal process. That might be a factor here.\n\nMorally, it's a bit more complex. He clearly didn't want kids, and this situation is a shock. But the mother is determined to keep the child. From her perspective, his refusal to support the child might be seen as selfish, especially if she's already struggling. On the other hand, he's in a new relationship and moving to a new apartment, so his life is changing. But the child is a result of their relationship, so he might feel responsible.\n\nHe mentions they used contraceptives, but they still got pregnant. That's possible, as no method is 100% effective. However, they were in a relationship, so both are responsible. The key issue is his willingness to cut off all contact and support. Legally, he's probably obligated to pay child support. Morally, it's a tough spot, but abandoning a child is generally frowned upon. His new girlfriend and new apartment might add to his stress, but he's still responsible. \n\nThe ex's friends are calling him selfish, which might be valid because he's choosing not to support a child that is his. Even if he didn't want kids, once there's a child, he has a responsibility. So, legally and morally, he's in the wrong for wanting to walk away from financial and parental responsibilities. The answer is likely A.\n"
