We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author dated a girl for a few months, which seemed like it could be long-term. Then they had a breakup and didn't talk for months. The ex contacts them again and says she's pregnant, a few months along. The author is shocked because they were clear they never wanted kids. They refused to get back together, denied paternity, and hung up. The ex is determined to keep the baby, and tests confirm the author is the father. Now, the author is considering a \"financial abortion,\" which I think means not accepting any financial responsibility for the child. They don't want contact, child support, custody, etc. Their current girlfriend and new apartment are mentioned, implying their current life is stable and they don't want disruption. The ex's friends are calling them selfish, and the author is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, legally, in many places, if you're the biological father, you can be required to pay child support even if you don't want to be involved. The author might need to go through a legal process to disclaim paternity, but if the tests have already confirmed it, that might not be possible. Legally, they might be obligated, so wanting to avoid that could be problematic.\n\nMorally, this is trickier. The author was upfront about not wanting kids, but the ex might have thought they could change their mind. The author's stance is that they don't want any part in the child's life, which could be seen as selfish, especially if the child is their biological one. However, if the author can prove they were clear about their stance and that the pregnancy was unexpected (maybe due to a contraceptive failure they weren't aware of), some might understand their position. On the other hand, others would argue that once a child is born, the father has a moral responsibility regardless of the circumstances.\n\nThe fact that they used contraceptives but the pregnancy still happened might be a point. If the ex is claiming it's the author's fault for not supporting the child, but the author was against having kids and used protection, maybe there's some shared responsibility. However, typically, once paternity is established, the legal responsibility is on the father, even if the mother also used contraceptives. So legally, the author might be on the hook.\n\nThe author's current girlfriend and new apartment suggest they might be avoiding responsibility to protect their current relationship and lifestyle. That could be seen as prioritizing their own comfort over the child's needs, which might make others view them as selfish.\n\nBut I should also consider the possibility that the ex might have withheld information or not followed up properly. The author says they were clear about not wanting kids, so maybe the ex knew that but still chose to continue the pregnancy. If the author can show they were explicit, maybe they have a case. However, the author is the one who needs to take action here, and their refusal to engage could be seen as not taking responsibility.\n\nIn many places, if a man is the biological father, he can't just opt out of responsibility without legal consequences. The ex could take them to court for child support. So the author's desire to avoid that is not legally feasible. Morally, it's a gray area. Some people might see it as the father's responsibility once the child is born, others might argue that since the author was clear, they aren't directly responsible for the pregnancy. But the child's needs come into play here, and the author's refusal to support could harm the child's well-being.\n\nThe friends are calling the author selfish, which is a moral judgment. Whether they are right depends on societal norms and personal ethics. Legally, the author is likely in the wrong because they can't just disclaim responsibility once the child is born. Morally, it's more nuanced, but wanting to avoid all responsibility might be seen as unethical, even if the author was clear about not wanting kids. The child's right to support is a factor here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is probably in the wrong both legally and morally. They need to take responsibility for their child, regardless of their personal wishes. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
