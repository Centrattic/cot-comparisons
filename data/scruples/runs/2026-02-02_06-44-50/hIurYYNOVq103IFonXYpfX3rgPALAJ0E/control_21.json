We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion.\" Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author was in a relationship that ended a few months ago. They were clear they never wanted kids. The ex girlfriend came back after no contact, saying she's pregnant with his child. He's against getting back together and wants nothing to do with the child, no support, no contact. His new relationship and new apartment are now affected, and he's feeling overwhelmed. He's considering cutting all ties and not paying child support, which he refers to as a financial abortion. The ex's friends are calling him selfish.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate if he's in the wrong. Legally, in many places, fathers are required to provide financial support regardless of their willingness. So he might not be able to legally walk away. Morally, it's more complex. He didn't want kids, and the pregnancy happened despite contraceptives. But he's the biological father, so does he have a moral responsibility? Some might argue that since he's the father, he has a duty. Others might say he shouldn't be forced to support a child he never wanted. However, abandoning the child could be seen as selfish, especially if the mother is struggling. The fact that they broke up and he was clear about not wanting kids complicates things. But the pregnancy occurred, and he is part of the equation. The mother's friends are criticizing him, but he's also in a new relationship and life situation. \n\nThere's a balance between personal responsibility and personal choice. Legally, he might be obligated, so not paying could be against the law. Morally, the question is whether he's responsible for the child's well-being. Some people might say yes, others no. Since the user is asking if he's in the wrong, the answer could be A (wrong) because he's avoiding responsibility, or B (not wrong) because he was clear about not wanting kids and it's not his fault. However, the act of not taking responsibility despite being the father might make him wrong. But the situation is tricky because he's not the one who wanted the child. I think legally he's wrong if he refuses support, but morally, it's a gray area. The question is about being in the wrong, which could be both. The answer might depend on cultural or ethical perspectives. The user is probably looking for a B, but I'm not sure. The key points are his clarity about not wanting kids, the unexpected pregnancy, and his refusal to support. In many places, child support is mandatory, so he can't just walk away. So, he's in the wrong legally, but maybe not morally. However, the question is about being in the wrong, and the options are A or B. Since the answer is a simple A or B, and considering both moral and legal aspects, maybe A is the answer because he's shirking legal and moral responsibilities. But I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, some might argue that he's not wrong because he didn't consent to the pregnancy and made his stance clear. The answer might be B. Hmm. I need to decide. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, he is if he avoids support. Morally, it's debatable. But since the user is asking if he's in the wrong, and the options are A or B, the answer is likely A. So I'll go with A.\n"
