We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about an unexpected pregnancy, and the man wants to cut all ties and avoid financial responsibility. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, fathers are legally required to provide child support once paternity is established. So if he's the biological father, he might not be able to legally disown the child. That could be a point against him.\n\nThen there's the moral side. He says he never wanted kids and was clear about that, but they had a relationship. Even if they broke up, if they were in a committed relationship, some might argue he has a responsibility. However, the breakup had been months with no contact. The woman reached out after the fact. \n\nThe\u907f\u5b55\u63aa\u65bd (contraceptives) were used, but they still got pregnant. That's unexpected. He's stressed about his new relationship and living situation. His main argument is that he doesn't want to be a father and can't handle the responsibility. \n\nThe other side is the mother and her friends calling him selfish. Morally, some might see his stance as avoiding responsibility, while others might empathize with his position, especially if he was clear about not wanting kids. \n\nLegally, he might be obligated to pay child support regardless of his feelings. So even if he wants to walk away, the law might not let him. Morally, it's more nuanced. Did he have a responsibility when they were in a relationship? If they were together and had a sexual relationship where he wasn't on birth control, some might say he's equally responsible. \n\nBut he claims he was clear about not wanting kids. However, sometimes people say that but still have to accept the consequences if it happens. So maybe he's not wrong in feeling this way, but legally he's bound. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering both legal and moral aspects, the legal standpoint suggests he's obligated, so he can't just walk away. Morally, it's a tough call. Some might say he's in the wrong for not supporting, others not. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe Reddit-style question often leans towards the person being called out, but in this case, the user is asking if the author is wrong. Since he's seeking to avoid responsibility, but the law might require it, maybe the answer is A, he is in the wrong. However, the morality is debatable. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If legally he has to pay, then in terms of the situation, he's not doing what's required by law, so he's in the wrong.\n"
