We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again and think about it step by step.\n\nThe user is in a debate about whether they are the asshole (AITA) for wanting a \"financial abortion\" after their ex-girlfriend got pregnant months after a breakup. They had a relationship that was going long-term but broke up and didn't talk for a few months. Then the ex contacts them, says she's pregnant, and wants his support. The user had clearly stated they never wanted kids. They rejected the idea of getting back together and hung up. She wants to keep the baby, and they're considering disavowing all rights and responsibilities, not paying child support, etc. Their current GF and new apartment are mentioned as part of their current life, which they don't want to disrupt.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspects. In most places, if the child is confirmed to be his, he's legally responsible for child support. So he can't just opt out of that without legal consequences. The term \"financial abortion\" isn't a legal term, but what he's describing is terminating his parental rights. That process isn't straightforward and typically requires the court's approval, which might not be granted if the mother is unfit, but in this case, the mother is determined to keep the child. Legally, he might be expected to support the child financially regardless of his willingness.\n\nNext, the moral side. The user had a relationship that ended, and while they broke up, they were still in a situation where they had unprotected sex and the ex became pregnant. The user's main argument is that they never wanted kids, but they were in a committed relationship. If they were in a committed relationship and the ex got pregnant, some might argue that he's responsible because he was a willing participant. However, they broke up before the pregnancy was discovered, so maybe that affects the perception. The fact that they used contraceptives but still had a pregnancy might also play a role in how people view the situation\u2014maybe they thought they were being careful, but it didn't work.\n\nThe ex's friends are calling him selfish, which is a moral judgment. The user is in a new relationship and moving to a new apartment, so their stance is about maintaining their current life. But the mother is keeping the child, so he can't avoid being part of the child's life entirely. Morally, some people might think that since he is the biological father, he shares responsibility for the child's well-being. Others might see his stance as reasonable if he never wanted children and the relationship had already ended.\n\nI also need to consider the context of the breakup. The user says they had been months without contact and the breakup was clear. If the ex should have known his stance on children and still engaged in a relationship, maybe there's some fault there. But if the breakup was final and they didn't have contact since, it's not entirely his responsibility. However, once a child is born, the legal and moral obligations might kick in regardless of the breakup status.\n\nThe user is definitely facing a tough situation, but the key points are the legal responsibilities and the moral implications of denying support to a child he fathered. Even if he doesn't want to be involved, child support is usually a legal requirement. So he might be in the wrong legally if he doesn't pay. Morally, it's more complicated. Some might argue that he has a duty to support a child he helped create, even if he didn't plan for it. Others might empathize with his situation, especially if the breakup was clean and he never wanted kids. However, the ex's friends are likely right in saying he's being selfish by not supporting the child.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, terminating parental rights can be done voluntarily, but it's a court process and might require the consent of the mother or the state. If he terminates his rights, he might not have to pay child support, but that would mean he's giving up any rights to the child. The user seems to want to do this, but it's not as simple as just saying \"no.\" There could be legal repercussions if he doesn't go through the proper channels and the mother or the state comes after him for support.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, he might be in the wrong if he doesn't follow procedures to terminate his rights. Morally, it's a gray area, but many might see him as responsible since he is the father. The fact that they were in a committed relationship and that he had the chance to have a child, even if he doesn't want it now, might lead people to think he's in the wrong for not supporting it financially. The ex's friends labeling him as selfish could be based on the idea that he has a responsibility to the child. Therefore, even if he's not in the right morally, legally he might have to comply with support unless he properly terminates his rights. So the answer is A, he is in the wrong.\n"
