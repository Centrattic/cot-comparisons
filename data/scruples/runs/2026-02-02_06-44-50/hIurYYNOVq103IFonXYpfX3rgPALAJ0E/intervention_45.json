We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who dated a woman, broke up, then found out she's pregnant. He never wanted kids, refused to get back together, and wants no financial responsibility towards the child. He's considering a \"financial abortion\" and is wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, legally, in most places, fathers have to pay child support even if they don't have custody. So trying to avoid that might not be possible. But the question is about morality, not just law. The guy claims he was clear about not wanting kids, and they were using contraception. However, sometimes things fail. The woman claims the child is his, and he's refusing any involvement.\n\nMorally, there's a debate. Some might say that being a parent involves responsibility, and even if he didn't want the child, he has a duty once it's born. Others might argue that if the pregnancy happened without his consent or knowledge, he shouldn't be forced to support it. But the fact that he was in a relationship and didn't take precautions (even if they used contraception) could be a point against him. Also, he's causing emotional distress to the mother, who might be dealing with this alone now. The mother's friends are upset, calling him selfish. The user thinks he's in the wrong, but the answer options are A for yes (he's in the wrong) and B for no.\n\nSo, considering the arguments: he had a relationship, was clear about not wanting kids, but the pregnancy happened. However, once the child is born, he's responsible. Even if he doesn't want the child, he can't morally avoid all responsibility. So the answer would likely be A (he's in the wrong). But need to check if there's any nuance. Maybe in some cultures or legal systems, but generally, parental responsibility is expected.\n"
