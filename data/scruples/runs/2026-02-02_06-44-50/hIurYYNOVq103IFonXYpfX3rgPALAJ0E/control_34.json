We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong regarding their decision to not have any financial or parental responsibilities for a child they didn't plan to have. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author had a relationship that ended a few months before the pregnancy was discovered. They were clear about not wanting children. The ex-partner is keeping the baby, and the author wants to avoid any responsibility, including child support. They're being called selfish by the ex's friends.\n\nLegally, in many places, fathers are required to provide financial support for their children, even if they weren't involved in the pregnancy. So the author might not have a legal option to opt out. Morally, it's more complex. The argument could be made that the author is responsible for their actions, even if the pregnancy was unexpected. On the other hand, the author was clear about their stance on children and the relationship had already ended. \n\nBut the key points here: the pregnancy resulted from a sexual relationship, and the author is now a parent. Even if they don't want the child, they might still have legal obligations. The term \"financial abortion\" isn't a legal term, so the author might not be able to legally avoid child support. Morally, some might say they have a responsibility, while others might empathize with their situation. \n\nThe author is also in a new relationship and has a new home, which adds to their stress. However, the ex's friends are criticizing them, which might be part of the emotional aspect. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, they probably aren't in the right if they can't opt out of child support. Morally, it's a gray area. The user is asking for a yes or no answer based on being in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might be seen as in the wrong because they have a legal responsibility as a parent, and morally, some might argue that they should accept that responsibility even if they didn't plan for it. However, others might understand their position. But in most societal and legal contexts, parents are expected to support their children. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
