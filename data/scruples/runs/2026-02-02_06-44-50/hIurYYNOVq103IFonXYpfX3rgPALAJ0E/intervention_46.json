We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a guy who had a short-term relationship that ended a few months ago. The ex-girlfriend got pregnant and now wants him to support the child, but he's adamant about not wanting kids and is considering a \"financial abortion,\" meaning no support, no custody, and cutting all ties. The user thinks he's in the wrong but is curious for my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many jurisdictions, fathers have legal obligations to support their children, even if they don't want to be involved. So he can't just resign his responsibilities legally. That's a key point. Legally, he's probably obligated to pay child support unless the court allows otherwise, like if paternity is disputed or if he can show some extenuating circumstances, but generally, it's hard to avoid.\n\nMoral standpoint is trickier. He never wanted kids and the pregnancy happened after the breakup. However, he did have a sexual relationship where there was a risk of pregnancy. Even if they used contraceptives, they can fail. So he might have a point about it being unexpected, but at the same time, having sex with the possibility of pregnancy is a reality. Morally, some might argue that as a biological father, he has a responsibility, even if he's not the one who wanted the relationship to continue. Others might say that since the relationship ended and he made it clear he didn't want kids, he shouldn't be forced to support a child he didn't plan for.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The ex is upset, her friends are calling him selfish. He's also in a new relationship and it's causing him a lot of stress. But the child's well-being is also a consideration. Even if he doesn't want to be involved, the child has a right to support. So from a moral perspective, some might see his stance as selfish because the child's needs are being ignored.\n\nAlso, the term \"financial abortion\" isn't a legal term. What he's asking for isn't possible in most places. So he's not just being considered morally, but he's also unaware or ignoring the legal realities. That might make him more in the wrong because he's trying to avoid responsibilities that he can't legally avoid.\n\nOn the other hand, if the pregnancy was a result of a one-off incident after the breakup, maybe the expectations of the ex are unreasonable. But the fact that they were in a relationship, even if it ended, means that paternity is a possible consequence. So he might be in the wrong because he's refusing to take responsibility for his actions, even if he's not the one who wanted the pregnancy.\n\nPutting it all together, legally he's likely in the wrong because he can't just opt out of child support. Morally, it's a gray area. Some would argue that he has a duty to support the child he helped create, others might say he's being realistic about his desires. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the user's own opinion was that he is in the wrong, and considering the legal obligations, the answer is probably A. But I need to check if there are any exceptions. For example, if the pregnancy was non-consensual, but the scenario doesn't mention that. So assuming it's consensual, he's in the wrong both legally and morally.\n"
