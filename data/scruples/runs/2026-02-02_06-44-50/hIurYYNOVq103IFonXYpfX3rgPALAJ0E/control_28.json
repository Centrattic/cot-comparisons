We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about an unexpected pregnancy after a breakup. The guy never wanted kids, they were on contraceptives, but she's pregnant. He's now with a new girlfriend and in a new apartment. He's considering cutting all ties and not paying child support, which he refers to as a \"financial abortion.\" The question is whether he's the asshole for wanting that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, I think fathers are legally obligated to pay child support, even if they don't want to be involved. So if he cuts off contact and refuses support, he might face legal consequences. That's a key point. The user is asking if it's legally okay, so that's a factor.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The woman is keeping the child, which is her right. The father is saying he doesn't want to be a parent, but he's also acknowledging the child is his. Does he have a moral obligation? Some might say yes, especially since he's responsible for the pregnancy. Others might argue that if he never wanted kids and the situation was a mistake, he shouldn't be forced into parenthood. But morally, there's often an expectation of responsibility for one's actions, even unintended ones.\n\nThe ex's friends are calling him selfish, which adds social pressure. But does that make him wrong? Maybe, maybe not. The user's situation is emotionally charged. They're stressed and scared, especially with a new relationship and new home. But that doesn't negate the other person's situation.\n\nThe author also mentions not wanting to force the mother to get rid of the baby or give it up. So he's not trying to take away her rights. He just wants to disengage himself. But legally, he can't just resign all rights. There's a process for terminating parental rights, which is usually difficult and requires the court to determine it's in the child's best interest. So from a legal standpoint, he can't just opt out.\n\nMoral responsibility is trickier. If he's the biological father, some people would argue he has a duty to support the child. Others might say that if the pregnancy was a result of a past relationship where he was clear about not wanting kids, and if they were using contraception, it's not his fault and he shouldn't be forced into parenthood. But the fact that they were using contraception isn't a legal defense against child support obligations.\n\nSo the author is likely in the wrong legally because he can't just cut ties. Morally, there's a debate. Some might see him as selfish, others as taking a realistic approach to his life choices. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer is probably A (yes) because of the legal obligations and moral expectations, even if his feelings are understandable.\n"
