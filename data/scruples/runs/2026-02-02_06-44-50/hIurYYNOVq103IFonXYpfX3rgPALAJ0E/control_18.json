We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves an unexpected pregnancy after a breakup, and the author's desire to avoid any financial or parental responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author dated a woman, they broke up, had no contact for months, and then she reveals she's pregnant. The author is clear he never wanted kids. He's in a new relationship and refuses to take on any responsibility, including child support. He's considering a \"financial abortion\" by cutting off all ties. The question is whether he's in the wrong morally and legally.\n\nLegally, in many places, fathers have financial responsibilities even if they don't want to be involved. Paternity can be established through DNA tests, and child support is typically required. So legally, he might be in trouble if he tries to avoid support. But he might be able to establish paternity voluntarily and then seek a termination of parental rights, but that's not automatic. Usually, termination requires proof of abandonment, neglect, etc., which he might have, given the lack of contact, but it's a legal process.\n\nMoral-wise, opinions vary. Some might say he's selfish for avoiding responsibility, others might empathize given the circumstances. The ex girlfriend's friends are calling him selfish, but his perspective is that he never wanted a child and is in a new relationship. The key here is whether he's morally obligated to step up despite his personal wishes.\n\nThe user is asking for an answer A or B. The options are whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The original AITA post usually ends with a judgment based on community response. In similar cases, communities often have mixed reactions. Some understand the shock and unwillingness to parent, others criticize the lack of responsibility. However, legally he's likely obligated, but the question also includes moral and legal aspects.\n\nThe answer given in the example was B (not in the wrong), but I need to verify. The user wants the answer in A or B. Considering the scenario, the author's stance is to avoid all responsibilities. Legally, he might be required to pay child support once paternity is established. Morally, some might see it as avoiding responsibility. However, if he can legally terminate parental rights, which he might be able to do since he's not involved and never wanted to be a parent, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But it's a gray area. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), as the user's answer example was B. But need to check if the reasoning aligns.\n"
