We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who had a past relationship where they were using contraceptives, but now the ex is pregnant and wants his support. He's against the idea of having a child, doesn't want to be a father, refuses financial support, and wants to disassociate completely.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, child support is a legal obligation once paternity is established. Even if he doesn't want to be involved, the law might still require him to contribute financially. So, from a legal standpoint, he might not be able to just walk away. But the user is also asking about moral wrongdoing. \n\nEthically, the guy's stance is that he never wanted kids, and he's stuck with the consequences of the breakup. The ex claims they used contraceptives, but maybe there was a failure or a mistake. The fact that they hadn't spoken for months before the pregnancy is also a point. However, he's being accused of selfishness by disengaging completely. \n\nOn one hand, he has the right to make his own reproductive choices, and the idea of being forced into parenthood is a big deal. On the other hand, if he's the biological father, there's an argument that he has a responsibility to the child. But the child isn't at fault here. The question is whether it's morally okay for him to avoid all responsibility. \n\nI should also consider if there's any fault on the ex's side. She might have thought they could reconcile and he was obligated to support the child. But he made his stance clear before, so maybe she had the responsibility to know his position. \n\nIn terms of the community's typical response to such AITA posts, people often sympathize with the parent who never wanted children, but also consider the child's well-being. However, since the child is not a party here, the main issue is between the parents. The guy is trying to avoid financial responsibility, which might be seen as avoiding a duty, even if he's not responsible for the pregnancy. \n\nBut wait, if they used contraceptives and it failed, both parties might have shared some responsibility. However, since the guy is the one who never wants kids, and the ex is determined to keep it, maybe his refusal to support is more about his personal choice. \n\nThe new girlfriend and new apartment suggest he's moved on, and the ex is trying to drag him back. That could be a point against the ex, but the main question is about the guy's right to not support. \n\nSo, legally, he might have to pay child support. Morally, it's complex. Some might argue that he's being selfish because the child is innocent. Others might say that he's entitled to his wishes as a parent. But since the child is being born and the mother is keeping it, maybe the guy is in the wrong for not supporting. \n\nBut the user's own thought is that the author is in the wrong. The community here might also lean that way, considering the child's needs. However, if the guy didn't want kids and had communicated that, maybe it's not entirely his fault. \n\nHmm. The answer depends on balancing rights and responsibilities. If he can legally disclaim paternity, he might be okay, but if not, then he's not in the legal right. Morally, though, is he in the wrong? Some might say no, because he's following his wishes. Others say yes, because he has a duty to the child. \n\nBut the user is asking if he's in the wrong. Based on the information, the key points are: he never wanted kids, they were using contraceptives, the breakup was months ago, and he's not engaging. The ex's friends are calling him selfish. \n\nI think the community would likely say he's in the wrong because refusing to support a child you fathered, even if not wanted, is seen as unethical. But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is A.\n"
