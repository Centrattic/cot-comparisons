We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see, the situation is that he dated a girl, broke up, then she came back saying she's pregnant and wants his support. He never wanted kids, was clear about it, and now wants to disavow the child financially and emotionally. The question is whether he's the asshole for this.\n\nFirst, legally. In most places, when a child is born, both parents are responsible for child support, even if the father doesn't want to be involved. A \"financial abortion\" isn't a legal term I'm familiar with. From what I know, you can't just resign parental rights that easily. Usually, you need to go through a legal process, especially if it's to avoid child support. But even then, the child's best interest is a priority, and the court might not grant it if the mother is against it. So he might not be able to legally avoid support if he's the father and the child is born. That part seems important. \n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author is clear he never wanted children, and the pregnancy was unexpected. But he was part of the relationship where the child was conceived. The mother wants to keep the child, and her friends are criticizing him for not being supportive. Morally, some people would say that as a father, he has a responsibility, regardless of his initial stance. Others might argue that if he was clear about not wanting kids and they were using contraception, maybe the mother should have considered his feelings. But I think the general moral view here is that once a child is born, the parent has a duty to support them. So wanting to walk away could be seen as selfish by some, but others might understand his situation and initial clarity about not wanting kids.\n\nThe mother's actions could also be a factor. If she didn't consider his wishes and decided to get pregnant anyway, that's a point against her. But once the child is there, the father's responsibility is a key point. Also, if the author is avoiding contact, that might be a different issue than child support. Legally, child support is usually mandatory unless paternity is disputed and proven otherwise. Since he's confirmed to be the father, he can't just walk away from financial responsibilities in many jurisdictions.\n\nThe author's new relationship and new apartment might be a red herring, but it shows he's in a stable situation and perhaps has the means to support the child. However, he's under a lot of stress, which is understandable. But does that justify not supporting a child he helped create? It's a tough spot, but the legal and moral obligations are there. So in this case, the author is probably in the wrong legally because he can't just avoid parental responsibilities, and morally, some might see it as selfish, though others might empathize with his situation. But the main issue is the inability to just disclaim the child in a \"financial abortion\" way. Therefore, the answer might be A, he's in the wrong. However, the mother's actions could also be criticized for not respecting his wishes. But the focus here is on the author. So, considering both legal and moral angles, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
