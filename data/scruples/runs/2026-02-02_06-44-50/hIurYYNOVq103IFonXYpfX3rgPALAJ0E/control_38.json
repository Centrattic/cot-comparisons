We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person had a relationship that ended, and they were clear about not wanting kids. Then after a break-up, the ex-partner reveals she's pregnant. The author is shocked and refuses to get back together or take responsibility for the child. They want to avoid any financial or parental obligations, hence the \"financial abortion\" idea. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, legally, in many places, if you're the biological father, you may be required to provide child support regardless of your consent to the pregnancy. So even if they don't want to be a parent, the law might not let them off the hook. The author mentions wanting to resign all rights and responsibilities, but that's not always possible. The mother has the right to keep the child, so he can't force her to give it up. So legally, he might be in a tough spot, but maybe he's not in the wrong legally if there's a way to terminate parental rights, which can be a long process.\n\nMorally, it's more complex. The author was clear about not wanting kids, but they were in a relationship and used contraceptives. The mother might argue that she should have known better or that he's responsible now. However, the author didn't cause the pregnancy beyond their mutual actions, and he's being honest about his inability to be a parent. But the ex's friends are calling him selfish, which adds social pressure. \n\nThe author is in a stressful situation, especially with a new relationship and apartment. He's trying to avoid being a parent because it goes against his values. However, some might say that once you create a life, you have a responsibility. Others might argue that if you're clear about not wanting kids, and the pregnancy happens despite precautions, the father should have the right to step back.\n\nSo, the answer depends on legal and moral standpoints. Legally, he might have obligations. Morally, people might have different views. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not forcing the mother to keep the baby but is trying to avoid responsibility, some might see it as selfish, while others might empathize. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) context usually looks at intent and fairness. The author is upfront about his stance, which might make others see him as doing what he believes is right, but the mother and her friends feel wronged. So, maybe it's a complicated case where the answer is not clear. But according to the options, the answer is A or B. Given the legal aspect and the fact that he's trying to avoid responsibility which is expected, maybe A (he's in the wrong) is the answer. But if the law allows him to disclaim, then maybe not. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not just legal. Since the society often expects fathers to support their children, he might be seen as the asshole. So A.\n"
