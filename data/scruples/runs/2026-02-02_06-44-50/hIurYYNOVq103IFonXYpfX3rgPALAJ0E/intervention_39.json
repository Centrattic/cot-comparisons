We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to disengage from a child they didn't plan on. The situation is that the author was in a relationship, broke up, didn't have contact for a while, and then the ex gets pregnant. The author clearly stated they don't want kids, and now are considering a \"financial abortion\" to avoid any responsibility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many jurisdictions, even if a father doesn't want the child, they are still legally responsible for child support once paternity is established. So the author might not have the legal right to disclaim responsibility. That's a key point. Legally, they might be in a tight spot, but the question is about being in the wrong morally or ethically.\n\nMoral-wise, is it selfish to avoid child support? The author argues that they don't want to be a father and can't handle the situation, especially with a new relationship and life changes. However, the child is innocent here, and the mother is carrying the child. The author's stance could be seen as abandoning a child they helped create. Even if they used protection, sometimes things fail. The mother is determined to keep the baby, so the author might feel they have no control, but they do have responsibility as a parent.\n\nThe author's new girlfriend and their stability might be a factor in their stress. But the mother's friends are calling them selfish, which makes me think there's a social expectation to take responsibility. On the other hand, the author did end the relationship and was clear about not wanting kids. The question is whether that's enough to absolve them of responsibility.\n\nAlso, the term \"financial abortion\" is a bit of a misnomer. Legally, the author can't just disclaim parental rights without the mother's consent or a court's approval, which is hard to get. So they might not have a legal out, but the moral question is still there. The author is in a tough spot, but the expectation in many societies is that fathers have a duty to their children. So even if the author is upset, they might be in the wrong for wanting to avoid that duty. The answer likely leans towards A, but I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. For example, if the author was intentionally avoiding contact and the pregnancy was unexpected. But overall, the moral responsibility of parenthood is a strong argument against the author.\n"
