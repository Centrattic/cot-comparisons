We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author dated someone, broke up, and then found out the ex is pregnant. He never wanted kids and is refusing any responsibility, including financial support. His new girlfriend and their new apartment are mentioned, so he's moving on with his life. He's considering a \"financial abortion,\" which I think means cutting off all ties and not providing support. His ex's friends are calling him selfish, but he feels it's necessary.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal aspects. In most places, if you're the biological father, you're legally responsible for child support regardless of consent or relationship status. So he can't just walk away; he might be required by law to pay. That's a key point.\n\nMorally, this is trickier. The author didn't want kids and was clear about that, but he was in a relationship where they had sex and used contraceptives, which failed. The question is whether he has a moral obligation. Some might argue that having a child is a shared responsibility, even if the pregnancy wasn't planned. Others might say since he never wanted it and was clear about his stance, he shouldn't be forced to support it. But then again, if you engage in sexual activity, you take on some responsibility for possible consequences, even with precautions.\n\nThe ex's friends are criticizing him, but that's common in such situations. The author is in a new relationship and feels this is a huge disruption. However, the mother's well-being and the child's upbringing are also factors. The mother chose to keep the baby, so she has the primary responsibility, but the father's role is complex.\n\nIn terms of being the \"asshole,\" the author's refusal to take any responsibility might be seen as selfish, especially if it affects the mother and child negatively. But if he was clear about his stance on children, some might sympathize. However, once a child is born, there are societal and legal expectations of parental responsibility, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nSo putting it all together, legally he's probably in trouble if he avoids support. Morally, it's a gray area, but the act of cutting off all responsibility could be seen as wrong, even if he didn't plan for it. The answer might lean towards A (in the wrong), but I need to make sure.\n"
