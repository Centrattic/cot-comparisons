We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated. So, the user dated someone, broke up, and now she's pregnant. He was clear he didn't want kids. Now she wants him to be involved, but he doesn't. He's considering cutting off all contact and not paying child support. The question is whether he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, legally, in most places, if he's the biological father, he's usually responsible for child support, regardless of the circumstances. There's no such thing as a \"financial abortion\" that completely absolves him of responsibility. He might be able to seek a termination of parental rights, but that's not automatic and might require the mother to agree, or a court to decide it's in the child's best interest. Also, if he's on the birth certificate or confirmed paternity through other means, he can't just walk away.\n\nMoral-wise, it's more subjective. He didn't want kids, which is his right. But the child isn't his fault. Some might argue that as a parent, you have a responsibility once the child is born, even if you didn't plan for it. Others might say he's not at fault because he made his stance clear and the pregnancy happened despite precautions.\n\nThe ex's friends are calling him selfish. That's a strong term. But he's also in a new relationship and moving into a new place, so the situation is stressful for him. The key points are: he was clear about not wanting kids, the pregnancy happened despite precautions, and he's trying to avoid responsibility now.\n\nBut legally, he's probably responsible. Morally, it's a grey area. The mother wanted to keep the child, so she has the right to do so. He can't force an abortion or adoption. So, he's not in the legal wrong, but morally, some might see him as avoiding responsibility. However, since he didn't want kids and was clear, it's a tough call. The answer might be B, but I need to check the laws about parental rights. In many jurisdictions, once a child is born, the father can't just disown them unless there's a legal process, which might not be possible here. So he's not in the wrong legally, but maybe morally? The question is if he's in the wrong, which could be both. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer might be B because he's not legally required to pay if he can terminate rights, but that's complicated. Alternatively, if he can't terminate, then he's not in the wrong because it's the law. But the question is about being the asshole, so more on the moral side. The community often views not providing child support as selfish, even if legal. So maybe A or B. Hmm. The original question is whether the author is in the wrong, so I need to decide based on the info given. The answer is B because the user is not legally in the wrong, and morally, it's a tough call but he's not necessarily in the wrong for not wanting to be a parent.\n"
