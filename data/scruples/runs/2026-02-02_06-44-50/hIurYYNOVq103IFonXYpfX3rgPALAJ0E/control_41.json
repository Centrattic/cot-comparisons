We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is about an unexpected pregnancy, and the author wants to cut all ties and not provide financial support for the child. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, once paternity is established, a man is legally obligated to pay child support, even if he doesn't want to be involved. So the author might not have the legal right to just walk away. But the post mentions \"financial abortion,\" which I think refers to legal termination of parental rights. That might be possible, but it's usually not that straightforward. The mother would have to agree, or there would need to be extreme circumstances like abuse or neglect. Since the mother wants to keep the baby, the author might not be able to terminate his rights.\n\nMoral standpoint is trickier. The author is clear he never wanted kids and wasn't in a relationship with the mother anymore. However, impregnating someone and then refusing all responsibility could be seen as selfish. The mother is going through a tough situation, and the author's refusal to help might add to her burden. On the other hand, the author feels traumatized and is in a new relationship, so his perspective is also valid.\n\nThere's also the contraceptive aspect mentioned. They were using birth control, but it failed. That's a natural risk, but does that absolve the author of responsibility? Not necessarily. If two people engage in sexual activity, even with contraception, there's an understanding that there's a risk involved. The author might feel blindsided, but he's still a parent now.\n\nThe friends calling him selfish\u2014maybe they're right. But maybe he's justified in his stress. The key points are legal obligations and moral responsibility. Legally, he might be in the wrong if he can't terminate rights. Morally, it's debatable. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer likely leans towards A (yes), because he can't just opt out of parental duties once the child is born. But I need to check if the options are A for yes, he's wrong, or B for no. The user wants a letter answer. Considering all, the answer is A.\n"
