We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author dated a girl for a few months, and they were on the verge of a long-term relationship. Then things went bad, and they had months without contact. The girl then reaches out saying she's pregnant and wants support. The author made it clear he never wanted kids, and now he's refusing to be involved, even going so far as wanting to avoid financial responsibility. He's in a new relationship and moved into a new apartment, and this news is causing him a lot of stress. He's considering a \"financial abortion,\" which I assume means not paying child support, no custody, and no contact. His ex's friends are calling him selfish.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to determine if he is.\n\nLegally, in most jurisdictions, if you're the biological father, you have legal obligations toward the child, even if you don't want to be involved. So he can't just resign his rights unless the mother agrees to terminate or adoption. But since she wants to keep the baby, he can't avoid child support. So legally, he's not allowed to walk away completely. That's a point against him.\n\nMoral-wise, this is trickier. People have different views on responsibility for children. Some would argue that if you contribute to a pregnancy, you have a responsibility to support the child, even if the circumstances are unexpected. Others might say if the mother is not holding him responsible beyond financial support and he's not wanted in the child's life, maybe he's not the only one at fault. However, the fact that he's refusing all contact and support might be seen as selfish. The ex's friends are calling him selfish, which adds to the social judgment.\n\nThe author's argument is that he was clear about not wanting kids, and the pregnancy happened despite precautions. But using that as an excuse to avoid responsibility might not hold up. The contraceptive failure is a risk, but once a child is born, the father usually has responsibilities. Also, cutting contact and support could affect the mother and child, especially if she's relying on him for resources.\n\nHe's in a new relationship and new home, which might make him feel like this is a burden. However, the child is his, so it's not just about his current situation. The fact that they had months of no contact complicates things, but legally, paternity still applies.\n\nSo, putting it together: Legally, he can't avoid child support. Morally, some would say he's responsible for the child's well-being, even if he doesn't want to be a parent. Others might sympathize with his position, but the majority might see him as avoiding responsibility. The answer would likely be A (he's in the wrong), but I need to check if there are nuances I'm missing. For example, if there's a legal way to terminate parental rights, but the mother is keeping the baby, so he can't do that. Therefore, he's not legally allowed but morally, it's a gray area. Still, in terms of societal judgment, he's likely seen as the asshole here because he's refusing all responsibility.\n"
