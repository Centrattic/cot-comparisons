We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author dated a girl for a few months, and it seemed like it could be long-term. Then they had a breakup and no contact for months. The girl then contacts him saying she's pregnant and needs support. The author is clear he never wants kids. He refused to get back together, hung up, and now she's determined to keep the baby. The author has a new girlfriend and a new apartment, and he's really stressed about this. He wants to disavow any financial responsibility, no contact, no child support, etc. Her friends are calling him selfish. The question is, is he the asshole?\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author and the ex-girlfriend were in a relationship that ended a few months before the pregnancy. They had no contact after the breakup. The author explicitly stated he doesn't want kids, which is a significant point. Now the ex is pregnant, and he's not willing to take any responsibility financially or otherwise. The girl is keeping the baby, and the author is looking to legally disassociate himself from the child.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many jurisdictions, fathers do have legal obligations once paternity is established. Even if the father doesn't want the child, he might still be required to pay child support. However, the author is asking if he can legally resign all rights and responsibilities. I think in some places, a father can voluntarily relinquish his rights, but that's usually a legal process and might require the mother's consent. If the mother is determined to keep the child, the author might not be able to just walk away. So legally, he might be required to contribute financially unless he can legally terminate his parental rights through a court, which isn't usually straightforward if the mother opposes it.\n\nMorally, this is more complex. The author never wanted children, which is a personal choice. However, since the child is his, does he have a moral responsibility to support it? Some might argue that yes, because the child is innocent and needs care. Others might say that the mother is the one who chose to keep the child, so she should bear the responsibility. But the author's position is that he had no intention of having a child, and the pregnancy happened despite contraceptive use. But if they were using contraception and it failed, that's a risk both parties take. However, the author might feel that since the relationship was over and the mother didn't take precautions, she's responsible. But that's a common debate.\n\nThe author's ex-girlfriend's friends are calling him selfish, which is a common reaction. But is he in the wrong? If he's not willing to support a child he didn't want, which could be seen as abandoning the child. On the other hand, if the relationship was over and the mother made the choice to keep the child, maybe he should have the right to disassociate. But in many places, the law says he can't just walk away. Morally, some people might see him as avoiding responsibility, while others might understand his stance regarding his personal life choices.\n\nI should also consider if the author had used protection and it failed. Both parties are responsible for contraception. The author might have felt he was clear about not wanting kids, so the mother should have been more careful. But the mother is now facing the consequences, and the author is facing the paternity. The author's new relationship and stable living situation are being threatened by this, which is a valid concern for him.\n\nIn terms of societal views, there's often a push for fathers to take responsibility, even if they didn't plan for a child. So the author is likely in a tough spot. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. If from a legal perspective, he can't just avoid responsibility, but if he can legally disassociate, then maybe not. But in most cases, he can't. Morally, it's a gray area. If he's not willing to support the child, some would say he's being selfish, while others might empathize with his position.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is probably in the wrong because he can't legally disavow all responsibility, and morally, there's an expectation that he would support his child, even if he didn't plan for it. However, the situation is complex because the relationship was over, and the mother is keeping the child. But the author's refusal to pay child support or have any contact is likely seen as irresponsible. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
