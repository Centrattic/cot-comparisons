We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves an unexpected pregnancy after a breakup, with the author wanting to disengage financially and emotionally.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most jurisdictions, biological fathers are legally required to provide financial support for their children, even if they don't want to. So the author's desire to avoid child support might not be legally feasible. That's a key point because the question mentions whether it's \"morally and legally okay.\" Legally, they might be obligated, which could mean they're in the wrong if they try to avoid it.\n\nNext, the moral side. The author claims they never wanted kids and are now in a new relationship. But a child's right to support and a parent's responsibility is a moral argument for the author to be involved. On the other hand, the author might feel they were clear about not wanting children, and the pregnancy was a result of circumstances they didn't anticipate. But the fact that they were using contraceptives doesn't necessarily absolve them of responsibility if there was a failure in the method.\n\nThe mother wants to keep the child, and the author is considering disengagement. The mother's friends are criticizing him as selfish. Societal views often hold that parents have a duty to support their child, so the author's stance might be seen as morally wrong. However, some people might argue that if the father was clear about not wanting children, he shouldn't be forced into parenthood. But this is a nuanced area. \n\nAlso, the author's reaction of being \"floored\" and the lack of contact after the breakup might indicate they didn't plan for this scenario. The suddenness of the situation could be a factor, but that doesn't necessarily justify avoiding responsibility. The mother's emotional well-being and the child's needs are important considerations here. \n\nIn many places, paternity can be denied through legal means like DNA testing, but if it's confirmed, the father is usually held responsible. The author mentions the tests showed the kid is theirs, so legally they can't just walk away. Morally, it's about taking responsibility for one's actions, even if unexpected. \n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, the author is likely in the wrong because they can't avoid child support once paternity is established. Morally, it's a bit trickier, but many would argue that they have a responsibility to support the child financially, even if they don't want to be involved otherwise. The author's decision to cut off contact and avoid support might be seen as selfish, given that the pregnancy could have been a result of contraceptive failure, which is not entirely the mother's fault. The mother's friends' criticism adds a social perspective where the community might expect the father to step up. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because the legal obligations are clear, and morally, there's an expectation of responsibility for one's child, even if the father doesn't want to be a parent.\n"
