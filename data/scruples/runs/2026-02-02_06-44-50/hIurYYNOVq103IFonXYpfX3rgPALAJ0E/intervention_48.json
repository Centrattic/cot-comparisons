We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he dated a girl for a few months, they broke up and had no contact for a while. Then she comes back saying she's pregnant, and he's not ready for kids. He's clear he never wanted kids, and he turned her down when she suggested getting back together. Now he wants to cut off all financial and parental responsibilities, hence the \"financial abortion.\" His girlfriend and new apartment life are mentioned as part of his current stability, which this situation is disrupting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, once a man is determined to be the father, especially if it's confirmed through DNA testing, he has legal obligations. That includes child support. So even if he doesn't want to be involved, the law might not let him off the hook. He might not have legal rights to disclaim the child, especially if he's been acknowledged as the father or if the child is born and he's listed on the birth certificate. So from a legal standpoint, he might not have a choice in financial support.\n\nMoral standpoint is trickier. He was in a relationship, and even if they broke up, if they had a sexual relationship, he might be seen as having a responsibility. The fact that they used contraceptives but still had a pregnancy could be a point\u2014maybe they failed, but both parties are responsible. However, since he's the father, some people might argue he has a moral duty to support the child even if he's not involved in parenting. Others might say that if he never wanted kids and the relationship ended, it's not fair to force him to support a child he didn't plan for. \n\nThe author's actions\u2014refusing contact, child support, and custody\u2014could be seen as selfish by some. The mother's friends are calling him out, which adds to the social pressure. But he's in a new relationship and situation, which complicates things. However, the fact that he refused to get back together and made his stance clear might mitigate some blame. \n\nBut then, once the child is born, he might have no legal way out of financial support. So even if he wants to disclaim the child, the law might tie him down. So he's in a tough spot. But is he morally in the wrong? If he's the father, some would say yes, because the child is a result of their actions. However, if he was clear about not wanting kids and the mother went against that, maybe she's also at fault. But the mother is choosing to keep the child, so he's stuck with the responsibility.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, he's likely obligated. Morally, it's controversial. Some would say he's in the wrong because he's responsible for the child's existence. Others might sympathize due to his stance on not wanting kids. But the key point here is that he's not taking responsibility for the child, which could be seen as selfish. The fact that he's trying to avoid all contact and financial support without considering the child's needs might make him the asshole. So maybe the answer is A, yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
