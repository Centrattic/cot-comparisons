We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to avoid financial responsibility for a child he didn't want. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author dated someone for a few months, then they had a breakup with months of no contact. The ex then contacts him saying she's pregnant. The author clearly stated he never wanted kids. They were using contraceptives, but it didn't work. Now the author wants to disavow any parental rights and responsibilities, which he's calling a \"financial abortion.\" The ex and her friends are upset, calling him selfish. The question is whether he's in the wrong morally and legally.\n\nLegally, I know that in many places, fathers are required to provide child support regardless of their willingness. Even if you don't want custody or contact, you might still be legally obligated to support the child financially. So from a legal standpoint, the author might not have a choice in that. But the question is about being in the wrong morally and socially.\n\nMorally, this is trickier. The author is being honest about his lack of desire for children and is upfront about it. However, by engaging in a sexual relationship, there's an implicit responsibility, even if they used contraceptives. The fact that the contraceptives failed isn't his fault, but he still is a parent. The ex is keeping the child, and the author is refusing to take any responsibility. Some might argue that he's being selfish by walking away, especially when the mother is going to raise the child alone. Others might say he's being honest about his limits and not pretending to be someone he's not. But there's also the aspect of the mother's well-being and the child's future. The author's refusal to support could burden the mother with all the financial and emotional responsibility. \n\nHowever, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides. The author isn't trying to force an abortion or adoption; he's just not wanting to be involved. Some people might see that as responsible if he's upfront, while others might see it as cruel. The mother's friends are upset, so there's social pressure here. But the author's stance is clear from the start. \n\nIn terms of morality, it's a gray area. Legally, he might be obligated. So the answer depends on how one views the moral responsibilities of parenthood. If you believe that once a child is born, the parent has a duty to support it regardless of circumstances, then the author is in the wrong. If you believe that if the father never wanted a child and is honest about it, then he's not in the wrong, but that's a more contentious view.\n\nSo the user is leaning towards the author being in the wrong, but I need to check if that's accurate. The answer is probably A (in the wrong) because of the legal obligations and the moral duty to support a child, even if unintended. But I should make sure I'm not missing any nuances. The author is upfront, but responsibility might still be there regardless.\n"
