We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who had a brief relationship, broke up, and then found out the woman he was with is pregnant. He never wanted kids, they hadn't been in contact for months, and now he's refusing to be involved financially or emotionally.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most jurisdictions, once paternity is established, the father is legally obligated to pay child support. He can't just \"resign\" his rights that easily; there are legal procedures to terminate parental rights, which are usually strict and require showing neglect or other severe issues, not just not wanting the child. So legally, he might be in trouble if he doesn't comply.\n\nMoral standpoint is trickier. The man claims he was clear about not wanting kids. However, if they were in a relationship that led to a pregnancy, there's an argument that he should be responsible. The woman decided to keep the child, so she's the parent, but the biological father might still face societal judgment for not supporting the child. But others might argue that he was honest about his stance and shouldn't be forced into parenthood against his will.\n\nThe woman's friends are calling him selfish. That's a common reaction when someone refuses to pay child support. But the author is also stressed about his new relationship and living situation. He might be overwhelmed, which is understandable, but doesn't excuse legal obligations.\n\nThe key points are: clear communication of not wanting kids, breakup with no contact, paternity confirmed, and refusal to support. Legally, he's probably in the wrong. Morally, it's a gray area. The community might be split, but since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer likely hinges on legal responsibility and societal expectations. The term \"financial abortion\" isn't a standard legal term, so that's probably a red flag. The answer is likely A, he's in the wrong.\n"
