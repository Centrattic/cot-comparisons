We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who had a brief relationship, broke up, then found out he's a father. He doesn't want any part in the child's life and wants to avoid financial responsibility. His new girlfriend and their new apartment are mentioned, and he's considering a \"financial abortion\" by cutting all ties.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, fathers have legal responsibilities once paternity is established, even if they didn't want the child. So legally, he might have to pay child support. But the question is more about whether he's morally wrong.\n\nMorally, this is tricky. The author didn't plan for the child, but he's the biological father. Some might argue that he has a responsibility to support a child he helped create. Others might say that since he was explicit about not wanting kids, and the pregnancy happened despite precautions, he shouldn't be forced to have a role he didn't consent to.\n\nThe mother is keeping the child, and the author is refusing to be involved. The mother's friends are calling him selfish. From a parental responsibility standpoint, some people might see him as avoiding duty. But if he never wanted children, is it fair to force him to support them? There's also the aspect of the child's well-being\u2014having a father figure could be important.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author had no intention of being a parent and the relationship ended, maybe he's not the one to blame. But biologically, he contributed, so there's a sense of shared responsibility.\n\nI think the debate is between personal choice vs. responsibility. The author is in a tough spot, but avoiding all responsibility might be seen as selfish. So maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong), but I'm not 100% sure. The legal side is clear he's responsible, but morally, it's a grey area. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not just legal. The community might lean towards him being in the wrong because of the responsibility angle.\n"
