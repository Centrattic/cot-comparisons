We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for wanting a \"financial abortion,\" which I think means not taking any financial responsibility for the child. \n\nThe author dated a girl for a few months, but they broke up and had no contact for a while. Then she contacted him saying she's pregnant and wants his support. He didn't want kids and had made that clear. He rejected her suggestion to get back together, and now he's really stressed out because he's with a new girlfriend and moved into a new apartment. He's looking for a way to avoid any responsibility, like not paying child support or having contact. His ex's friends are calling him selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, paternity is determined through DNA testing, and once that's established, the father is legally obligated to pay child support regardless of his willingness. So the author can't just say \"no\" and walk away legally. That might be a problem. But the author is asking if it's morally and legally okay. Legally, probably not. Morally, it's trickier. \n\nMorally, even if he didn't want kids, he is the biological father. Whether or not they had good contraceptive methods, the result is a child. The author might feel it's unfair to be responsible, but others might argue that as a parent, you have a duty. Plus, the mother is set on keeping the child, so even if he doesn't want to be involved, the child deserves support. The author is in a new relationship, which might not be relevant, but it's part of his stress.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. The key points are: did they use contraception properly? The author says they were \"fairly strict,\" but maybe that's not enough. If they used them correctly, the pregnancy might be an accident. But the author is now faced with responsibility. Legally, he can't opt out, so he's wrong in thinking he can. Morally, if you create a child, you have a responsibility, even if unintended. So maybe the author is in the wrong because he's trying to avoid responsibility. His ex's friends are criticizing him, which might be right. So answer A: Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
