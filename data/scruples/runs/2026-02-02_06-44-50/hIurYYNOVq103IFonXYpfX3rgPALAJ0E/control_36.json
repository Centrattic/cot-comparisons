We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on their situation. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author dated a girl for a few months, and then they broke up, going months without contact. The ex then contacts him saying she's pregnant. He's clear he doesn't want kids, and he's shocked. He rejected the idea of getting back together and tried to end the conversation. The child is his, and he's considering a \"financial abortion\" to avoid responsibility. His new girlfriend and their new apartment add to his stress. The ex's friends are criticizing him as selfish.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, fathers have financial responsibilities for their children, even if they're not involved. So if he wants to avoid child support, he might need to go through the legal system to terminate parental rights. But that's not easy and might require proof of abandonment or other factors. So legally, he might not be able to just opt out.\n\nEthically, this is trickier. The author made it clear he didn't want kids, but the situation happened. Some might argue that once a child is born, the father has a responsibility, even if he didn't plan for it. Others might say that if the pregnancy was a result of the ex's actions and he's not willing to take responsibility, he's being selfish. However, the author is also in a new relationship and possibly unprepared for parenthood, which complicates things.\n\nThe ex's friends labeling him as selfish is a point to consider. But whether he's actually in the wrong might depend on societal views on parental responsibility. Also, the fact that they had a breakup and no contact before the pregnancy could affect perceptions. If they were in a relationship, even a short one, some might expect more responsibility.\n\nHowever, the author is not asking to take the child from the mother, just to not be involved financially. The term \"financial abortion\" might be a stretch, but the concept is about cutting ties. Legally, he can't just opt out of child support unless he has no legal parent rights. The mother could legally pursue child support, so he might have to face that.\n\nIn some places, you can't disclaim paternity unless the mother agrees or under specific circumstances. So if the mother is determined to keep the child, the father might have no choice but to be involved. The author's stance might be legally difficult to enforce but ethically, it's a gray area. It's possible he's in the wrong from a responsibility standpoint, but others might empathize with his situation.\n\nSo, considering both angles, the author might be in the wrong because he has a legal responsibility he's trying to avoid, and ethically, some would argue that once a child is born, the father has obligations. However, there's also the aspect of his prior stance on not wanting kids. But I think the consensus is that he's in the wrong here, so the answer would be A.\n"
