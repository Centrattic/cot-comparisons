We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who had a breakup with a girl, then she contacts him saying she's pregnant and wants support. He was clear he never wanted kids and refuses to be involved now. He's considering a \"financial abortion\" by cutting off all contact and not paying child support, but his ex's friends are calling him selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. Legally, in most places, a father does have responsibilities once paternity is established. Even if he doesn't want custody, he might still be obligated to pay child support. So the author might not have a legal option to completely disengage. But the post mentions the kid is his, so maybe he's considering relinquishing parental rights. However, that's usually a legal process and not something he can just do unilaterally. \n\nMorally, this is tricky. The guy was clear about not wanting kids, but the pregnancy happened. He's not trying to force an abortion, which is important, but he's not willing to take any responsibility. Some might see it as selfish because the child is a result of their relationship, and he's not stepping up. Others might understand his position if he's never wanted children and the situation was unexpected. \n\nThe ex's friends are upset, but maybe the mother is the one facing the real challenges. The guy's new relationship and apartment might be a factor in his refusal to get involved. But does that make him the asshole? It depends on societal views on parental responsibility. \n\nAlso, the fact that they were using contraceptives but it still happened. Maybe there's a shared responsibility there, but the mother is keeping the child. The guy's stance is to not be involved, which could be seen as avoiding responsibility. \n\nSo, the legal aspect suggests he can't just opt out without formal steps, but the moral question is more complex. The community might split on this. However, in most cases, child support is expected, and refusing it could be seen as morally wrong, even if the relationship is over. Therefore, the answer is likely A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he's avoiding his parental responsibilities, even though he had no intention of having kids.\n"
