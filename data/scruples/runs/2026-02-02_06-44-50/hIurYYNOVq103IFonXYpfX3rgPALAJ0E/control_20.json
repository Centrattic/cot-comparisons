We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author dated a girl for a few months, things were looking long-term, but then they broke up and had no contact for months. The girl then comes back saying she's pregnant, and he's the father. The author is clear he never wanted kids, so he's against getting back together and refuses to take any responsibility. He's now with a new girlfriend and is stressed because of this situation. He wants to disavow any financial or parental responsibilities, hence the \"financial abortion\" idea. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, legally, in most places, a biological father does have financial responsibilities for a child, even if he wasn't involved after the breakup. So wanting to cut off financial support might not be legally possible. He might need to go through a formal process, like terminating parental rights, which is complicated and not easily done. So legally, he might be wrong if he can't just decide to stop support.\n\nMorally, it's more subjective. The author is being honest about his feelings and his inability to take on parental responsibilities. However, the mother is choosing to keep the child, and the father's refusal to support could be seen as abandoning the child. On the other hand, the pregnancy happened after their breakup, so some might argue he's not responsible since the relationship ended. But pregnancy can occur after a breakup, especially if there was a period where they were not using protection. The author's use of contraceptives is mentioned, but he's unsure how it happened. That might be a point about shared responsibility, but if the pregnancy was unintentional, the father still has obligations.\n\nThe mother's friends are calling him selfish. That's a common reaction, but does that mean he's in the wrong? It depends on societal views. Some might say that once a child is born, the father has a moral responsibility regardless of the circumstances. Others might argue that if the relationship ended and they were clear about not wanting kids, the mother should have been more careful.\n\nAlso, the author's new relationship and their new apartment are part of his stress. He's trying to protect his current life and mental health. It's understandable that an unexpected child would cause panic, but the decision to avoid responsibility could be seen as not taking responsibility for his actions, even if the relationship was over.\n\nIn terms of legal and moral obligations, the key points are: the father's right to disclaim paternity, the legal requirement for child support, and the ethical implications of walking away from a child's life. Legally, he might be required to pay unless he can terminate his rights, which is difficult. Morally, the question is whether he's responsible for supporting a child he didn't plan for, especially if the pregnancy occurred after the breakup. However, the fact that he was a parent figure before the breakup might complicate that.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, he's likely in the wrong if he tries to avoid financial support without going through proper legal channels. Morally, it's a gray area, but society often places the responsibility on the father, even in cases where the relationship ended. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but there are nuances. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, and given that he's refusing responsibility and trying to avoid it, the answer is likely A.\n"
