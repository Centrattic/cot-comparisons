We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion,\" which means not paying child support and having no contact or custody. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many jurisdictions, once paternity is established, the father is legally obligated to pay child support. The author might not be able to completely opt out of that. So, legally, they might be wrong.\n\nMorally, it's a tricky situation. The author was in a relationship, and even if they broke up, they were involved when the pregnancy happened. Not wanting children was clear, but they might still have a moral responsibility. On the other hand, the author was clear about their stance on kids, and the mother kept the baby despite the breakup. \n\nThe mother's friends are calling the author selfish, but the author is stressed about their new relationship and life changes. The author didn't want children, so their refusal to be involved could be seen as sticking to their values. However, some might argue that being a parent is a responsibility regardless of initial desires. \n\nThere's also the question of consent and how the pregnancy occurred. The author mentions they were careful with contraceptives, but that's not always foolproof. The mother might have known about the author's stance but chose to keep the baby anyway, which complicates things.\n\nLegally, the author might not have the option to completely disengage. Morally, it's debatable. Some might say the author is being selfish, others that they're being honest about their limits. But legally, they could be in trouble if they don't pay support. So, the answer might hinge on whether the question is about legal wrongness or moral wrongness. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, which is likely both. But the options are A for yes (in the wrong) and B for no. \n\nConsidering legal obligations, the author is in the wrong if they refuse support. Morally, it's a gray area but there's a strong argument that they are responsible. So the answer would be A.\n"
