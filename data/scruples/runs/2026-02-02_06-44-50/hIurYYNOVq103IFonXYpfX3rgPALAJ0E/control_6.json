We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong regarding a situation involving an unexpected pregnancy and wanting a financial abortion. First, I need to understand the scenario clearly. The author was in a relationship that ended a few months ago with no contact. The ex then contacts him saying she's pregnant, and he never wanted children. He turns down getting back together, refuses to be involved, and wants to avoid child support. His new girlfriend and their new apartment are part of the context. The ex's friends are upset, calling him selfish.\n\nSo, the main points are: the pregnancy was unexpected, the couple had broken up and hadn't been in touch, the author is clear about not wanting kids, and he's considering disavowing all responsibilities. The user wants to know if he's in the wrong morally and legally.\n\nStarting with the legal aspect. In many jurisdictions, when a man is found to be the biological father, he has legal obligations. Even if the relationship is over, paternity can be established, and child support is typically mandatory. There might be ways to challenge paternity if there's doubt, but the author says tests have confirmed it. So legally, he might not be able to avoid child support. The concept of a \"financial abortion\" isn't a real legal term, but there could be legal processes to terminate parental rights. However, those are usually difficult and require showing that it's in the best interest of the child, or that the parent has abandoned the child. Since the author is proactively trying to avoid responsibility, the legal system might not agree with his stance unless he can meet specific criteria for terminating parental rights.\n\nMoral aspect is trickier. People have different views on responsibility. Some might argue that even if he didn't want children, once a child is born, the father has a moral duty to support them. Others might say that if the pregnancy was a result of a failed contraception and he was clear about not wanting kids, he shouldn't be obligated. The fact that they were using contraception but the ex is keeping the baby complicates things. The author's refusal to be involved could be seen as selfish, especially if the child is his. On the other hand, he might genuinely feel unprepared and overwhelmed, especially with his new relationship and living situation.\n\nThe ex's friends are upset, which suggests social pressure. The author's response is firm, but the question is whether that's fair. If he's being a father, he has responsibilities. But if he's not willing to take them on, is that a moral failing? It depends on the perspective. Some would say yes, once a child is born, parental responsibility kicks in. Others might consider the circumstances, like the breakup and his stance on children. However, the moral obligation is often seen as existing regardless of intent, especially from the child's standpoint.\n\nPutting it all together: Legally, he might have limited options to avoid support once paternity is established. Morally, many would argue he has a responsibility to his child, even if it's not wanted. So the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to check if there's any nuance. The post says he \"never wanted kids\" and the pregnancy was a shock. However, the moral stance usually includes taking responsibility for the consequences of one's actions, even if they were unintended. So, he's probably in the wrong because he's trying to disavow the child, which is a common ethical viewpoint. Legally, it's complicated, but the question is about whether he's in the wrong, which is a moral/ethical judgment. The answer would be A.\n"
