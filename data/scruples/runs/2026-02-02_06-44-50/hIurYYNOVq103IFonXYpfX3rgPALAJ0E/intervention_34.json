We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who had a past relationship, they broke up, and now the ex claims she's pregnant with his child. He's against kids, doesn't want to be a father, and refuses any financial or parental responsibilities. He's considering a \"financial abortion,\" which I think means avoiding child support and all responsibilities, even if it means not acknowledging the child.\n\nFirst, I need to break this down. Legally, in most places, a father can't just walk away from a child. There are laws about paternity and child support. So even if he doesn't want the child, he might still be obligated to provide financial support. But the user is also asking about morality. Is he selfish for not wanting to take on that responsibility?\n\nThe guy says he was clear about not wanting kids. But if they had sex and got her pregnant, even with contraceptives, maybe there's a point where both parties have some responsibility. The mother is keeping the child, so the father's options are limited. He can't force her to abort or give it up for adoption. So he's left with the responsibility of financial support.\n\nBut he's in a new relationship, moving into a new apartment, and this is causing him stress. His ex's friends are calling him selfish. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nLegally, he might have no choice but to pay child support once paternity is established. So wanting to avoid that could be against the law. Morally, it's tricky. He doesn't want the child, but he's a father now. Some might say he's responsible for the child's well-being, even if it's not his plan. Others might argue that if both didn't plan for a child, maybe the mother should consider adoption to find a more willing parent.\n\nBut the key points here are the legal obligations and the ethical responsibility. If he's legally required to support the child, then his desire to avoid it could be seen as wrong, both morally and legally. The fact that he was clear about not wanting kids doesn't absolve him of responsibility once a child is conceived. So in that case, the author is in the wrong. He can't just disown the child financially. The answer is probably A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But maybe there are nuances. Like if he can legally terminate parental rights, which is possible in some cases, but usually requires the mother's consent or court approval, which she might not give. So he might not have legal recourse to avoid support. Therefore, his desire to avoid it is both legally problematic and ethically questionable. Hence, A.\n"
