We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the given scenario. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author dated someone, they broke up, had no contact for months. The ex then reveals she's pregnant and wants support. The author is clear he doesn't want kids and refuses to get back together or take responsibility. He's in a new relationship and is scared about financial obligations. He wants to disown the child legally and avoid child support.\n\nNow, I need to consider both legal and moral aspects. Legally, in many places, fathers have financial obligations once paternity is established. Even if he doesn't want custody or contact, he might still be required to pay child support. So legally, he might be in a tough spot if he tries to avoid it. But the question is about being in the wrong morally or ethically.\n\nMoral aspect: The author is being asked if he's selfish for not wanting to take responsibility. But he was clear about not wanting kids during the relationship. However, using contraception doesn't eliminate the possibility of pregnancy entirely, so maybe some might argue that he's still responsible. On the other hand, if he was honest about his stance on children, maybe he's not at fault here. The ex's friends are calling him selfish, but it's a complex situation. \n\nThe author is also in a new relationship and moving to a new apartment, which adds stress. He's not trying to harm the mother but doesn't want to be a father. He's not opposing adoption or the mother keeping the baby, just not taking financial responsibility. \n\nSome might argue that as a parent, he has a duty, regardless of his personal desires. Others might say that if he was upfront about not wanting children, it's the mother's choice to proceed with the pregnancy. \n\nI should also consider if the author is morally obligated. If he's not the one who changed his stance, and the mother chose to continue the pregnancy despite his wishes, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's avoiding responsibility that comes with being a parent, maybe he is. \n\nThe key points are: clear communication about not wanting kids, unexpected pregnancy after a breakup, refusal to take responsibility, and the mother's determination to keep the child. \n\nI think the answer might be that he's not in the wrong (B), because he communicated his stance, and the mother made her choice. But it's a gray area. Legally, he might be required to pay, but morally, depending on societal views, he could be seen as selfish. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Given that he was clear and the pregnancy resulted despite precautions, he might not be at fault. So answer B.\n"
