We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user dated someone for a few months, things looked like they might be long-term, but they broke up and had no contact for a few months. Then the ex contacts him saying she's pregnant and needs his support. The user had clearly stated he never wanted kids. He's shocked, doesn't want to get back together, and shuts down any possibility of being a parent. The ex is determined to keep the baby, and tests confirm the user is the father. He's now in a new relationship and a new apartment, and he's freaking out. He wants a \"financial abortion\"\u2014no contact, no child support, no custody. His ex's friends are calling him selfish, and he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, legally, what are the implications? In most places, once paternity is established, the father is legally obligated to provide child support. There's no such thing as a \"financial abortion\" in most jurisdictions. Even if the father doesn't want custody or contact, he's still responsible for financial support. So legally, he's in a spot where he might be forced to pay regardless of his feelings.\n\nMorally, it's more complex. The user didn't want children and was clear about that, but the fact that they had a relationship where conception could happen despite precautions (they used contraceptives) complicates things. The ex is choosing to keep the baby, so the user is now part of the child's life legally, even if he doesn't want it. The idea of cutting off all support might be seen as selfish because the child is now a human being that needs care. However, the user's argument is that he never wanted the child and is struggling with the new life circumstances. He's also in a new relationship and a new place, which might be a lot to handle.\n\nSome might argue that the user is responsible for the consequences of his actions, even if he didn't intend to have a child. Others might say that since the mother is keeping the baby and the father is not wanted by the mother, the father has a right to distance himself. But morally, most people might expect him to at least contribute financially, as it's not just a financial issue but a human one. The mother and child can't be left without support, and the father's responsibility is a part of that.\n\nThe user's refusal to pay could be seen as abandoning a responsibility, hence the friends calling him selfish. But the user also feels like he was blindsided and that the mother should have considered his stance on kids before getting pregnant. However, that's a bit of a double standard. The mother has her own rights to make decisions about her body and the future of the child, including not getting an abortion. The user's right to not be a parent is complicated by the fact that a child is involved, and society generally holds that parents have responsibilities to their children.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Legally, he can't just walk away from financial support. Morally, it's a tough spot. He made his stance clear, but once a child is born, the father's responsibilities are more absolute. Even if he doesn't want to be involved, he's still part of the child's life in terms of financial support. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because, regardless of his feelings, he has a legal and moral obligation to support the child. His desire to completely disengage is both legally and morally problematic.\n"
