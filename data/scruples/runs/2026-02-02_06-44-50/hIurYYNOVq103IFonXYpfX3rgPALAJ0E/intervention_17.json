We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a man who had a brief relationship, broke up, and then found out he's a father. He's clear he doesn't want kids and wants to cut all ties, including financial support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. From what I know, in many places, fathers have legal obligations for child support once paternity is established. Even if they don't want to be involved, they can't just opt out of financial responsibility. So legally, he might not have a choice here. The term \"financial abortion\" isn't a real legal term, so maybe he's misunderstanding the options.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The woman is keeping the baby, and he's refusing to support it. Some might say that since it's his child, he has a moral duty to help, regardless of his initial intentions. Others might argue that he didn't consent to being a parent and shouldn't be forced. But the problem is, once the child is born, the parent's rights aren't that simple. He can't unilaterally decide not to be a father if the mother wants to keep the child.\n\nAlso, the way he handled it\u2014shutting her down immediately and not engaging\u2014could be seen as selfish. The mother is carrying the child, dealing with the pregnancy, and he's not offering any support. His new girlfriend and new life might make him feel like this is a burden, but the child is already here or about to be, so his new life doesn't matter in that context.\n\nThe friends calling him selfish might be right. The mother has a right to support her child, and he's the biological father. Even if they don't want to be involved, the legal system usually requires some level of financial support. So morally, some might say he's in the wrong for not wanting to take responsibility. But others might empathize with his situation since he was clear about not wanting kids. However, the fact remains that he's a parent now, and that comes with responsibilities regardless of initial intentions.\n\nSo putting it all together, legally and morally, he's probably in the wrong. He can't opt out of child support, and morally, being a parent usually involves some level of responsibility. The answer would be A.\n"
