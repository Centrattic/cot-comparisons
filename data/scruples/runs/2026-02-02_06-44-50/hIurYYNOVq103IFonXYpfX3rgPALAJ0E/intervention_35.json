We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who had a brief relationship, broke up, and then found out the ex was pregnant. He never wanted kids and doesn't want to be involved, so he's considering cutting all ties and not paying child support. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, legally, most places require biological fathers to provide financial support for their children, even if they don't want to be involved. So from a legal standpoint, he might not be able to just walk away. But the user is asking about being in the wrong morally, not just legally.\n\nMorally, it's a bit more complex. People have different views. Some might say that even if you don't want the child, you have a responsibility because you are the biological parent. Others might argue that if the pregnancy was a result of a brief relationship and the man clearly didn't want kids, he shouldn't be forced into parenthood against his will. \n\nThe ex's friends are calling him selfish, which is a common reaction, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's wrong. It depends on one's values. In many cultures, there's an expectation that fathers support their children financially, regardless of the circumstances. However, there's also the argument that people should have the right to refuse parenthood if they didn't consent to it.\n\nThe man is also in a new relationship and a new apartment, which might add to his stress. The situation is undoubtedly challenging. The key points are consent to parenthood, responsibility, and societal expectations. \n\nBut considering that the child is his, even if the pregnancy was unexpected, many would argue that he has a moral obligation to support the child financially. Even if he doesn't want to be a father, the child exists and has a right to support. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong morally, even if legally he's bound by law. But I should check if there are legal precedents where fathers can disavow responsibility, but generally, I don't think so. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
