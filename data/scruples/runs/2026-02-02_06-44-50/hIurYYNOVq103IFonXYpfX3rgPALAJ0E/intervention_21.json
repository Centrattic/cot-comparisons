We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is: he had a girlfriend, they broke up after a few months, stopped talking for some time. She comes back saying she's pregnant and wants his support. He made it clear he doesn't want kids, so he's refusing to have any involvement. He's got a new relationship now and a new apartment, and he's really stressed. He's talking about a \"financial abortion,\" which I think means he doesn't want to pay child support or have any legal responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, once a man is determined to be the biological father, he's legally obligated to pay child support unless he can prove that the child isn't his or that there were extenuating circumstances. But since the tests confirm he's the father, legally he might have no choice. Also, he can't force the mother to get an abortion or give up the baby for adoption. The mother has the right to make those decisions.\n\nMoral issues are trickier. Some people might say that by having a child, the mother is in the wrong because it was a risky choice. But others argue that the mother is also in a vulnerable situation, especially if she's carrying the child to term. The author never wanted kids, but they were using contraceptives. Maybe they were not 100% effective, and that's just a risk. But does that absolve him of responsibility?\n\nHe's being called selfish for not supporting the child financially. If he is the biological father, some might say he has a responsibility to help, regardless of the breakup or his desire. On the other hand, if the father hasn't been involved in the relationship and the pregnancy was unexpected, maybe he's not in the wrong.\n\nBut here's the thing: even if he didn't want the child, once the paternity is confirmed, he might have to take responsibility. The idea of a \"financial abortion\" is about avoiding that, which could be seen as morally wrong because the child is already a human being with rights. Legally, he can't disown the child; he can only relinquish parental rights if he's actively involved in the child's life and then it's a complex process. If the mother wants to keep the child, he can't just walk away from financial responsibilities.\n\nSo the author is probably in the wrong both legally and morally. He can't avoid child support once he's the legal father, and morally, some would argue he should support the child even if he's not part of the parent's life. His reaction of wanting to cut ties completely might come off as dismissive and harmful to the mother and child. Plus, he's already been labeled as selfish, which makes people think he's in the wrong.\n"
