We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again carefully.\n\nThe author was in a relationship that ended a few months before the pregnancy was discovered. They were clear about not wanting kids. The ex contacted him after the breakup and told him about the pregnancy. The author immediately shut down the idea of getting back together and refused any responsibility. The ex is keeping the baby, and the author wants to disengage completely, including not paying child support. His current girlfriend and new apartment life are being affected, and he's considering a \"financial abortion\" to avoid any legal or financial obligations. His ex's friends are calling him selfish and hurting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and moral aspects. Legally, in many places, fathers have obligations even if they don't want to be involved. The father can't just disclaim responsibility once the child is born. Child support is typically mandatory unless there are specific legal steps taken, like a voluntary termination of parental rights, which is a complex and serious process. So legally, he might be in trouble if he tries to avoid support without going through proper channels.\n\nMoral aspect is trickier. The author was in a relationship, had a child, and then walked away. Even if he was clear about not wanting kids, once the child is born, not providing support could be seen as selfish. On the other hand, if the pregnancy was a result of a one-time lapse in contraception, maybe he feels it's unfair. But he was aware of the risks of not using contraception properly. The ex is carrying the child to term, so she's making a choice. The author is choosing not to be involved, which some might see as abandoning responsibility.\n\nThe author's new partner and moving into a new apartment might be a factor in his stress, but that doesn't absolve him of responsibility. The ex's friends are upset, which adds to the social judgment.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, he can't just avoid responsibilities without proper legal action, which he hasn't mentioned taking. Morally, by not providing support for a child he helped create, even if unwanted, could be seen as wrong. The fact that he was upfront about not wanting kids doesn't necessarily mitigate responsibility once the child is born. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong.\n"
