We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe user is a guy who dated a girl for a few months, and it seemed like it could be long-term, but things went bad. They stopped talking for a few months, then she contacted him saying she's pregnant and he's the father. He was clear he never wanted kids and shut down the idea of getting back together. Now, he's with a new girlfriend and has a new apartment. He's considering a \"financial abortion,\" which I think means not paying child support and cutting all ties. His ex's friends are calling him selfish, and he's asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, legally, what are his obligations? In most places, fathers are legally responsible for child support once paternity is established. Even if he doesn't want to be involved, he can't just walk away. There are laws about that. So from a legal standpoint, he would be wrong if he tries to avoid child support.\n\nMorally, this is trickier. He was clear about not wanting kids, but they had sex and used contraception. However, no method is 100% effective. The question is whether he's morally responsible. Some might say that having sex without wanting children but not being 100% certain about contraception makes him partially responsible. Others might argue that if the mother also contributed to the situation, she's responsible too. But the baby is his, so he's the father. Morally, some people might say he should take responsibility because he's the father, regardless of his initial stance.\n\nHe's also causing emotional distress by not being involved. The mother is going through a big life change, and he's completely cutting her off. That could be seen as selfish because it's not just about him; the child's life is also affected. If the child is his, even if he doesn't want to be a father, denying support could have long-term consequences for the child's well-being.\n\nBut he's under a lot of stress, and his current relationship and new life are important to him. He might feel that taking on the responsibility would disrupt his happiness. However, responsibility is part of being a parent, even if it's not wanted.\n\nSo putting it all together: Legally, he's obligated to pay child support. Morally, there's a case to be made that he should take responsibility for his child, but others might argue that since he was clear about not wanting kids and the situation was unexpected, he's not entirely in the wrong. However, given that he's the father and there's a child involved, society generally expects some level of responsibility. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (he is in the wrong) because he's trying to avoid a responsibility that is legally and morally expected, even if the circumstances are unfortunate.\n"
