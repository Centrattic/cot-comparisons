We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting a financial abortion. So, first, I need to understand the situation. The author had a relationship, broke up, then the ex got pregnant. He never wanted kids, they weren't in contact anymore. Now he wants to disassociate completely from the child, no support, no contact. His ex and friends are saying he's selfish.\n\nI need to consider both legal and moral aspects. Legally, in most places, a biological father can't just disclaim responsibility. Even if you don't want to be involved, child support is usually required. So he can't just walk away legally. Morally, people might have different views. Some would say he's being selfish because it's his child and he has a responsibility. Others might say if he never wanted kids and it's a surprise, maybe he's not at fault. But since it's his child, denying responsibility could be seen as wrong.\n\nThe author is stressed, has a new partner and life, but that doesn't necessarily absolve him. The key points are: he was clear about not wanting kids, but they were using contraception. Maybe the break up was final, but conception happened. Legally, he can't opt out. Morally, depending on the perspective. Some might argue he's being responsible by not getting involved, but others would say he's avoiding responsibility. The ex's friends calling him selfish might be a sign that society expects him to take some responsibility. So the answer might be A, he's in the wrong, but I need to check if there's a legal angle. Since the question asks if he's in the wrong, considering both moral and legal aspects, the answer is likely A.\n"
