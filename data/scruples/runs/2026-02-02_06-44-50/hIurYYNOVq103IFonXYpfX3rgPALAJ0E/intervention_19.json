We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The situation involves an unexpected pregnancy after a breakup, and the author wants to cut off all financial and parental responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, fathers are legally obligated to provide child support even if they don't want to be involved. So the author can't just walk away from financial responsibilities. That's a legal point against them.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The author had a relationship and used contraception, but there was a failure. Even if they didn't want kids, they are a parent regardless of their wishes. The mother wants to keep the child, and the father is refusing any support. Morally, some might argue that children shouldn't be punished for their parents' choices. But others might say the father has a right to refuse if he didn't consent to the pregnancy.\n\nThe author's current partner might also be affected if he's suddenly burdened with child support. But the mother is the one carrying the child, so she might have more immediate responsibilities. The friends calling the author selfish could be a point about empathy, but the father's own stress and not wanting kids is a counterpoint.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they have a legal responsibility and morally, as a parent, you have to support your child. Even if it's unexpected, the child's well-being is important. The answer is A.\n"
