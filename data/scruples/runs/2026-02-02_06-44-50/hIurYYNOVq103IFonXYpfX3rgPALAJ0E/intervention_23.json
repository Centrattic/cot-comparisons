We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who had a breakup, then found out his ex is pregnant with his child. He never wanted kids and is now considering a \"financial abortion,\" meaning he doesn't want any legal responsibility or contact with the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if someone is the biological father, even if they don't want to be involved, they might still be legally required to pay child support. So the author might be in trouble if he tries to avoid that. But I should check if there's a way to legally absolve himself. Maybe if he can prove he was not part of the pregnancy decision, but I'm not sure.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The author is rejecting a child he helped create. Some might see it as selfish, especially if the mother is going through this alone. But others might argue that he was clear about not wanting kids, and it's not his responsibility if the pregnancy happened despite precautions. However, the mother might have assumed there was a future together, so maybe she thought he'd be involved.\n\nThe author is in a new relationship and has moved to a new apartment, so this is a huge disruption. He's also being criticized by the mother's friends for being selfish. The question is whether his stance is morally acceptable. If he's not providing support, but the mother is the one carrying the child, maybe it's her choice to have the child. But he's still a parent, and some might say he has a duty.\n\nI think the answer hinges on the author's responsibility. Legally, he might have to pay child support, so trying to avoid that could be wrong. Morally, it's a gray area. He was clear about not wanting kids, but the pregnancy happened. However, rejecting the child entirely might be seen as neglectful. So, maybe he's in the wrong both legally and morally. The answer would be A.\n"
