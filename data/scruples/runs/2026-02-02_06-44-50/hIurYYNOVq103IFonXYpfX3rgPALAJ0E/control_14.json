We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for wanting a financial abortion, meaning not accepting any responsibility for the child. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, paternity comes with legal obligations, including child support. Even if someone doesn't want the child, they might still be required by law to provide financial support. So the idea of a \"financial abortion\" might not be legally possible. If the author is trying to avoid this responsibility, that could be against the law.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The mother is carrying the child and will have to deal with the pregnancy and childbirth. The father's responsibility is a big part of the equation. The author claims he never wanted kids and was clear about it, but if he's the biological father, some might argue he still has a responsibility. Others might say if the mother was also using contraception, it's a shared accident. But the author's refusal to be involved could be seen as selfish, especially if the mother is determined to keep the child. \n\nThe author's current situation with a new girlfriend and new apartment might add to his stress, but that's his personal life. His decision to cut off contact and not pay child support could affect the child's well-being. Morally, some might say that being a parent is a responsibility even if it wasn't planned. But others might empathize with his stance if he was clear about not wanting kids and the pregnancy was a mistake. \n\nThe mother's friends are calling him selfish, which suggests societal judgment. But legally, he might face consequences for not supporting the child. So the answer hinges on whether avoiding responsibility is morally acceptable and legally permissible. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, I need to weigh these factors. If the law requires support, then he's in the wrong legally. Morally, it's more subjective, but the father's responsibility is a common ethical stance. \n\nSo the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong) because he's likely breaching legal obligations and not taking responsibility, even if he didn't want the child.\n"
