We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding wanting a financial abortion. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author dated a girl for a few months, then they broke up and had no contact for months. The girl then came back saying she's pregnant. The author never wanted kids and made that clear. They had a breakup already, so the author is refusing to get back together. The baby is confirmed to be his. He's got a new girlfriend and a new apartment, and he's stressed. He wants to disavow any parental rights and responsibilities, not pay child support, etc. The girl's friends are calling him selfish. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the legal and moral angles. Legally, paternity is usually established if the father is named on the birth certificate or if there's a court order. Once paternity is established, the father is typically required to pay child support unless he can legally relinquish his rights. But in most jurisdictions, you can't just walk away from parental responsibilities without a legal process. However, the author might be in the early stages, so there's a possibility of doing a voluntary relinquishment, but that's usually time-sensitive. If the mother wants to keep the child, the father might not be able to avoid support unless he can prove he's not the biological father (which he can't here) or there's some other legal avenue.\n\nMoral-wise, it's more subjective. The author is clear he doesn't want children, and the pregnancy happened after a breakup. But he's responsible for the child's existence. Arguably, he's being realistic about his inability to care for a child. However, some might say that he's shirking responsibility. The mother is keeping the child, so the author's financial support is a part of being a parent. But since he's not involved in the child's life, the question is about morality versus legality.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. The user's reasoning might be that the author is avoiding responsibility. But others might argue that the author made his intentions clear, and the mother didn't respect that, so he's not at fault. Also, the author's actions post-breakup were to end the relationship, and the pregnancy occurred after that. However, the author might still have legal obligations regardless of the relationship status.\n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the author can legally terminate his parental rights and whether he's morally responsible. If legally he can't, then he might be in the wrong if he refuses to support. If he can, then maybe not. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The user's own thought is that the author is in the wrong. I need to consider if that's the case.\n"
