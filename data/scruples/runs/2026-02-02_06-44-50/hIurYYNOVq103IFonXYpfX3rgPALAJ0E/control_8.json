We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an unexpected pregnancy from a past relationship, and the author wants to avoid any financial or parental responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, fathers do have legal obligations to support their children financially, even if they don't want to be involved. So, the idea of a \"financial abortion\" might not be legally feasible. The author might not be able to legally escape child support duties. But laws vary by jurisdiction, so that's a key point.\n\nMorally, this is more subjective. The author is clear that they never wanted children and are in a new relationship. However, they might be seen as abandoning a child they helped create. Even if the pregnancy resulted from a past relationship, some might argue that they have a moral duty to support the child. Others might empathize with the author's stance, especially if they were clear about not wanting kids and the circumstances of the pregnancy were accidental despite precautions.\n\nThe mother's perspective is also important. She wants to keep the child, and the author's refusal could leave her in a difficult situation. The mother's friends are criticizing the author, which adds social pressure. But the author is also stressed about their current life and new relationship.\n\nI should also consider consent and responsibility. Even with contraceptives, accidents can happen. The author isn't at fault for the pregnancy itself, but once the child is born, they do have legal and moral responsibilities. The term \"financial abortion\" isn't recognized legally, so the author can't just opt out. They might have to provide support unless they can legally terminate parental rights, which usually requires the child to be placed for adoption, and that's not something the father can force.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a mix of legal and moral views. Legally, they might be obligated to pay child support. Morally, it's debatable. Some might see the author as selfish for not supporting a child they helped create, while others might understand their personal boundaries. However, the mother's decision to keep the child means the author can't avoid responsibility entirely. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong morally, but legally they have no choice. The question is whether they're in the wrong, so combining both aspects, the answer might be A (Yes) because they can't legally opt out and morally there's an argument for responsibility, even if the situation is difficult.\n"
