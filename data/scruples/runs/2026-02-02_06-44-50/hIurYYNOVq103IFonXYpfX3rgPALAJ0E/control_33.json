We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario carefully. The person had a relationship that ended months ago, and now the ex is pregnant. He never wanted kids, they broke up, and he's now in a new relationship. He's refusing to take any responsibility for the child, wanting to cut all ties and not pay child support. His ex and her friends are calling him selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, once paternity is established, a father is legally obligated to provide child support, regardless of his willingness. So if he's the biological father, he can't just walk away legally. He might have to go through a legal process to terminate parental rights, which is difficult and not automatically granted. Legally, he's probably not in the right because he's refusing to fulfill his obligations.\n\nMorally, it's a bit more complex. He never wanted kids, the relationship had ended, and he's in a new relationship. However, the child is his, and the mother is carrying the child to term. While he has the right to not want to be a father, he does have a responsibility once paternity is confirmed. Refusing all contact and support might be seen as selfish from a moral standpoint, especially if the child needs financial support. But some might argue that he shouldn't be forced to support a child resulting from a past relationship, especially if the breakup was amicable and they hadn't communicated for months.\n\nAlso, the fact that they used contraception and he's confused about how it happened might add context. But that doesn't absolve him of responsibility if the paternity tests confirm it. The key points are legal obligations and moral responsibility. Since the mother is keeping the child, he's the legal father and thus has responsibilities. So legally, he's in the wrong, and morally, it's questionable. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
