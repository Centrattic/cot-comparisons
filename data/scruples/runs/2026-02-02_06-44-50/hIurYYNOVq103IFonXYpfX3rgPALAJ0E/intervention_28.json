We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who had a brief relationship, broke up, and then the ex finds out she's pregnant. He's clear he doesn't want kids and refuses to take any responsibility, which has upset her and her friends. The guy wants to cut all ties and not pay child support, calling it a \"financial abortion.\" The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want to know the answer here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both the legal and moral aspects. Legally, in most places, fathers have some responsibilities towards their children, even if they don't want to be involved. So, can a man legally disown his child? From what I remember, in many jurisdictions, you can't just legally disown a child. There are laws that require child support, regardless of the parent's willingness. So the author might not have a legal option to avoid responsibility here. That's a point against him, because he might be trying to do something that's not legally viable.\n\nMoral aspect is trickier. The author is upfront that he doesn't want kids and the pregnancy was an accident despite using contraception. He's in a new relationship and feels this is a shock. On the other hand, the mother is determined to keep the child. Morally, is it right to not support your child? Some people might argue that it's selfish to not take responsibility, especially if the child is yours. Others might say that if both parties were using contraception and it was a mistake, he shouldn't be forced to support a child he didn't want. But generally, society tends to expect some level of responsibility, even if the father didn't plan for it.\n\nThe mother's friends are calling him selfish. That's a social judgment, but does that mean he's in the wrong? Maybe. If he's going against societal norms and legal expectations, even if he has good reasons, he might be seen as in the wrong. Also, the fact that the couple had a breakup and were out of contact complicates things. But the child is his, so responsibility might still fall on him.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, he can't disown the child. Morally, society often expects child support and some involvement. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for trying to avoid these responsibilities. But there's also the argument about unintended consequences and personal choice. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because of the legal obligations and moral expectations.\n"
