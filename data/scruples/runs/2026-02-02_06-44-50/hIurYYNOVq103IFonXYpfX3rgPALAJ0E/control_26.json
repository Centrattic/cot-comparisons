We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation carefully. The person dated a girl for a few months, and it looked like it could be long-term. Then they broke up and had no contact for months. Suddenly, she calls and says she's pregnant, a few months along, and the child is his. He was clear about not wanting kids, and he refuses to get back together. He's now with a new girlfriend and a new apartment, and he's panicking. He's considering a \"financial abortion,\" which means not paying child support, no custody, no contact. His ex's friends are calling him selfish and an asshole for not acknowledging the kid.\n\nFirst, let me consider the legal aspect. In most jurisdictions, if you are the biological father of a child, you are legally obligated to provide financial support, even if you don't want to be involved. So trying to disavow all financial responsibilities might not be legally possible. He might have to go through a legal process to establish paternity and then contest child support, but that's tricky. Legally, he's probably responsible.\n\nMoral considerations are more complex. He was clear about not wanting kids, but maybe he didn't make that as clear as he thought? If he was explicit, then morally, is he wrong to not want to be a parent? People have different views on this. Some might say he has a responsibility to the child regardless of his initial stance. Others might argue that if he was upfront about his stance, he's not at fault. But the fact that they had a breakup and months of no contact complicates things. Also, the mother decided to keep the child, which is her right, but he's not willing to be part of the child's life or support it financially.\n\nThe use of \"financial abortion\" is a term I'm not familiar with, but I think it refers to cutting off financial ties to the child, essentially avoiding child support. However, as I mentioned, that's likely not legal. So maybe he's in the wrong legally, but not necessarily morally? Or is he morally wrong for not supporting a child he helped create?\n\nAlso, the mother is taking it seriously, and her friends are upset. The author is avoiding contact and not wanting to be a parent. If the child is his, he might have legal obligations beyond his initial wishes. Morally, some might say that he's being selfish by not taking responsibility, while others might empathize with his stance on not wanting children.\n\nI should also consider if there's a possibility of DNA testing. The author says they had tests confirming the child is his. So legally, he's the father. Even if he doesn't want to be involved, he might still have to pay child support unless he can legally terminate his parental rights, which is a difficult process and usually requires cooperation from the mother, especially if she's keeping the child.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, if he was honest about his stance on children and the mother chose to go ahead with the pregnancy despite the breakup, is he still responsible? Or does his prior statement absolve him? It's hard to say, but many would argue that once a child is born, the parent has a responsibility regardless of initial intentions.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong both legally and morally because he can't just disavow responsibility for a child he fathered. The term \"financial abortion\" might be a misnomer, but legally, he can't opt out of child support unless he can terminate rights, which is complicated. Morally, not supporting a child you are the father of could be seen as selfish, even if you were against having kids beforehand.\n"
