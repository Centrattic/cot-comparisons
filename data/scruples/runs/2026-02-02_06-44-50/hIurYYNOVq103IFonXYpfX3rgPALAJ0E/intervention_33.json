We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The main issue here is about financial responsibility for a child after a breakup. \n\nSo, the author dated someone for a few months, and the relationship ended. They had a period of no contact, and then the ex-girlfriend called saying she's pregnant. The author made it clear they never wanted kids, and after the call, he refuses any involvement, including financial support. The ex is keeping the baby, and the author is looking for a way out of paying child support.\n\nFirst, I need to think about legal aspects. In most places, if you're the biological father, you're legally responsible for child support, right? Even if you didn't want the child or the pregnancy, once paternity is established, you have to support the child. So, if the author wants to disclaim responsibility, he might need to legally terminate his parental rights. But can he do that if he's not the custodial parent? I think it's complicated. Usually, you can't just walk away from child support if the child is yours. The law typically requires both parents to support their children financially.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The author is saying he doesn't want to pay for a kid he didn't plan. But some might argue that once a child is born, the parent has a duty to support them, regardless of initial intentions. Others might say that if the ex didn't inform him earlier or if they were using contraception properly, maybe the author isn't at fault. However, the fact that they were using contraception doesn't absolve him of legal responsibility, and morally, some people might still think he's obligated to contribute.\n\nThe ex's friends are calling him selfish, which is a moral judgment. Legally, he could be wrong if he tries to avoid child support. Morally, it's a bit more subjective. But in most societies, child support is considered a responsibility to ensure the child's well-being, even if the parent isn't involved otherwise.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong legally because he can't just refuse child support without legal steps. Morally, it's a gray area, but many would argue that a parent has a duty to their child. Therefore, the answer is probably A.\n"
