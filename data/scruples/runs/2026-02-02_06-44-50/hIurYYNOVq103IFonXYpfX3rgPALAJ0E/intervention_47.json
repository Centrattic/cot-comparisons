We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. So, the guy dated a girl for a few months, things ended, they didn't talk for a while. Then she comes back saying she's pregnant and he's the father. He never wanted kids, shut down the idea of getting back together, and now wants to avoid any financial responsibility.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal aspect. In most places, fathers are legally obligated to provide child support, even if they don't want the child. So, can he just walk away? Probably not legally. The concept of a \"financial abortion\" might not exist in the law. He might have to pay. So legally, he's in a tough spot because he might be forced to support the child financially.\n\nMoral-wise, it's more subjective. He didn't want kids, which is his personal choice. But he is a father now. Some people might argue that he has a responsibility to support a child he helped create, regardless of the circumstances. Others might say he was clear about not wanting kids, so the mother should have been responsible. However, the mother did choose to keep the child, so maybe she's accepting the responsibility, but he's refusing. That could be seen as selfish.\n\nAlso, there's the fact that they were using contraceptives. If that's the case, maybe there was a failure, but it's still a situation they both contributed to. The author is stressed because he has a new relationship and a new apartment, and this is causing him a lot of anxiety. His new girlfriend might be affected if he has to pay child support.\n\nHe's being called selfish by the other woman's friends. There's also the emotional impact on the mother and the potential child. Even if he doesn't want to be involved, the child might need support, and he's the biological father. So morally, some would say he's responsible. Legally, he probably is too.\n\nBut maybe the mother didn't communicate the pregnancy earlier, which is tricky. The breakup was months ago, and she waited to tell him. So maybe she didn't make an effort to reach out sooner. However, once she did, he has obligations. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is likely in the wrong both legally and morally. He can't just disown the child entirely, and he's being selfish by denying responsibility. So the answer should be A.\n"
