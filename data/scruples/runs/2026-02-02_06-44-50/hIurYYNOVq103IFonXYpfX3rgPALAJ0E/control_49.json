We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about an unexpected pregnancy and the author wanting to disengage financially and legally.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The author dated a girl, they broke up after months of no contact, and then she gets pregnant. The author was clear he didn't want kids. Now, he's in a new relationship, and he's refusing to have any responsibility for the child. He's considering a \"financial abortion,\" which I think means not providing child support or any involvement. The mother is keeping the baby, tests confirm paternity. The author's ex's friends are calling him selfish.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, in most places, fathers do have responsibilities, even if they're not married or involved. Child support is usually enforceable by law. So, if he tries to walk away, he might be legally liable for support. So from a legal standpoint, he might not be able to just cut off all responsibilities. That's a point against him.\n\nMoral standpoint is trickier. The author claims he never wanted kids and was clear about it. But if he participated in an intimate relationship with a woman, even if they broke up, he could be seen as having a responsibility. The fact that they used contraceptives but failed doesn't absolve responsibility. So morally, some might argue he's being selfish by not taking responsibility. However, others might say if he was clear about not wanting kids and they were using contraception, maybe the mother also shares some responsibility.\n\nThe mother is choosing to keep the baby, so she's making her own choice here. The author doesn't want to be a parent, but he still might be a legal parent. So he can't just disown the child legally. So he's in a tough spot. But wanting to avoid all financial and parental responsibilities could be seen as morally wrong, especially since the child is already on the way.\n\nThe author's new relationship and new apartment might make him feel the situation is unfair, but that doesn't necessarily justify avoiding responsibility. Also, the mother's friends are upset, which adds social pressure. But the main issue is his stance on child support and contact.\n\nSo putting it all together: Legally, he might be required to pay child support, so he's not allowed to just walk away. Morally, some would say he's responsible for the child's well-being, even if he didn't plan for it. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's trying to avoid legal and moral responsibilities despite being the father.\n"
