We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion,\" which means not taking any responsibility for the child financially or otherwise.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, once paternity is established, a father has legal obligations, including child support. So if the man is confirmed to be the father, he might not have a legal option to completely disavow responsibility. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong morally, not just legally.\n\nMoral perspective: The situation is complicated. The man was clear he didn't want kids, and they were using contraception. But they had sex without using it properly, leading to pregnancy. He's now in a new relationship and the pregnancy is causing him significant stress. He's not wanting to pay child support, which is a big responsibility. But the mother is keeping the baby. \n\nSome might argue that since you can't control every aspect of sex, even with precautions, he has a responsibility. Others might say he's being realistic about his life choices and that it's unfair to force him to support a child he never wanted. However, withholding support could impact the child's well-being. But the mother is already committed to keeping the child, so maybe he can't unilaterally decide that. \n\nAlso, the mother's friends are calling him selfish, which adds social pressure. But is it right to judge him? If he's not the one who wanted the pregnancy, but they had consensual sex, where is the line? \n\nI think the key points are: legal obligations likely require him to pay child support once paternity is confirmed. Morally, it's a gray area. He's being honest about his desires, but the reality is that he's a parent now. However, if he didn't want children, maybe he should have been more cautious. But life happens. \n\nSo the answer might depend on whether he's legally required to pay, but in terms of being the \"asshole,\" it's subjective. The author might be in the wrong if he's avoiding responsibility, but others might see his stance as valid. However, given the way the question is framed (AITA), the community might lean towards him being in the wrong for not wanting to take responsibility. But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is A (yes, in the wrong) because of the legal and moral obligations, but I need to check.\n"
