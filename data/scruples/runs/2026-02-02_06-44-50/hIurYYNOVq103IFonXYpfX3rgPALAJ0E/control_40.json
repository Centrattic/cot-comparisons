We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author dated a girl for a few months, and it looked like it could be long-term, but they broke up and had no contact for months. Then she contacted him saying she's pregnant. He was clear he doesn't want kids. He rejected the idea of getting back together, said they were through, and hung up. The mother is keeping the baby, DNA tests confirm he's the father. Now he wants to avoid any financial or legal responsibility, which he calls a \"financial abortion.\" His new girlfriend and new apartment are mentioned, and he's really stressed out. The mother's friends are calling him selfish.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. So, first, let's consider the legal aspect. In many places, fathers are legally required to provide financial support for their children, regardless of their willingness. So trying to avoid child support might not be legal. But the author is asking if it's morally and legally okay. So legally, probably not. Morally, it's more complicated.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some people might argue that a child has a right to financial support from both parents. Even if the author didn't want the child, once it's born, he's a parent and has responsibilities. On the other hand, the pregnancy happened after a breakup, and the author was clear about not wanting kids. The mother also chose to keep the baby, so she's making that decision. But the author is still biologically related, so maybe he's still responsible.\n\nBut then, the situation is a bit tricky. The breakup had been for months, and they hadn't spoken. The mother kept the pregnancy a secret until later. The author didn't know about it and was blindsided. He's in a new relationship and new life, which complicates things. However, the mother's friends are criticizing him for being selfish. That's a common reaction when someone doesn't take on parental responsibility.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? If he's legally required to pay child support, then trying to avoid that would be wrong. Morally, some might say that as a parent, you have a duty, even if you didn't plan for it. Others might argue that the mother should have considered the consequences before getting pregnant, especially since they were already separated. However, the mother is choosing to keep the child, so she's taking on the responsibility of raising it, but the father is being asked to contribute financially.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, fathers can disclaim paternity if certain conditions are met, like if they were not involved in the pregnancy or knew about it. But if the DNA test proves paternity, it's hard to disclaim. So legally, he might be stuck with financial responsibilities. Morally, it's a gray area. He didn't want the child, but he is the biological father. Depending on cultural values, some might see his stance as selfish, others might see it as realistic, given his clear prior stance on not wanting kids.\n\nSo putting it all together, legally he's probably not in the right. Morally, it's a tough call, but many might side with the idea that he's at least partially responsible, even if he didn't want the child. The answer might be A (he's in the wrong), but I'm not entirely sure. Some might argue B (not in the wrong) based on his prior statements and the circumstances. But given the legal obligations and moral expectations, I think the answer is A.\n"
