We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to disengage from a child they didn't plan on and refuse financial support. The situation is that the author dated someone, they broke up, then the ex got pregnant. The author made it clear they don't want kids, and now wants to cut all ties.\n\nFirst, legally, in most places, fathers do have responsibilities once paternity is established. You can't just walk away from child support. So even if the author doesn't want the child, they might still be legally obligated to pay. That's a key point.\n\nMorally, it's a bit more complex. The author is in a new relationship and has a new life, so maybe they feel overwhelmed. But the child isn't at fault here. The author's responsibility as a parent, even if they don't want to be involved, could be seen as a moral duty. However, the mother is keeping the child, so the author isn't forcing her to get an abortion or give up the child. \n\nBut the author is refusing any contact or support, which some might see as selfish. On the other hand, the author was clear about not wanting kids, and the pregnancy was unexpected. The question is whether the author is at fault for not wanting to be a parent now.\n\nAlso, the ex's friends are calling the author selfish, which adds social pressure. But maybe they are in a tough spot. Legally, they might be wrong, but morally, it's a tough call. The answer probably depends on the laws in their jurisdiction, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not about the legal specifics.\n\nSo considering both legal and moral aspects, the author might be in the wrong because they can't just abandon their parental responsibilities. Even if they don't want to be a parent, they have a duty once paternity is confirmed. So I think the answer is A.\n"
