We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an unexpected pregnancy, the man not wanting any responsibility, and considering a \"financial abortion\" by cutting off all ties and not paying child support. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, fathers are legally obligated to provide child support once paternity is established. Even if the man doesn't want contact, he can't just walk away from financial responsibilities. So legally, he might be wrong. \n\nMorally, it's more complex. The man was clear about not wanting kids, but the situation is now unavoidable. The woman is keeping the baby, and the child is his. Arguably, he has a moral responsibility to support his child, even if he's not ready for it. On the other hand, he's in a new relationship and might feel overwhelmed. But children have a right to support from both parents, so morally, he might be in the wrong.\n\nHowever, the woman's actions also matter. She waited months to contact him, then expected him to re-enter her life. That could be seen as manipulative or unfair. But the core issue is the man's refusal to take any responsibility. \n\nThe friends calling him selfish might have a point. Denying support to a child you fathered, even if you don't want it, could be seen as selfish. But the woman's approach might also be questionable. \n\nSo, putting it all together, legally he's likely wrong because he can't avoid child support. Morally, many might argue he's wrong for not wanting to support his child. But there's nuance in the woman's actions too. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Based on societal and legal norms, the answer is probably A (he's in the wrong).\n"
