We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about a situation where someone doesn't want to be a parent and is considering a \"financial abortion\" by cutting off contact and not providing support. \n\nFirst, the author had a relationship where they were clear about not wanting kids. The breakup was months ago, and then the ex contacts them with a pregnancy. The author is against getting back together and wants to cut all ties. They're considering not paying child support or having any involvement. The ex is keeping the baby, and the author is looking for a way to legally resign rights.\n\nLegally, in many places, if you're the biological father, you can't just walk away from child support. Even if you don't want custody, you're still responsible financially. There might be a way to terminate parental rights, but that's not straightforward and often requires the child to be in foster care or adoption through the system. The author might not be able to just opt out by saying they don't want to be involved.\n\nMorally, it's a tricky area. The author did have a relationship, used contraception (though maybe it failed), and was clear about not wanting kids. But once a child is born, there's an argument that they have some responsibility, even if they don't want to be a parent. On the other hand, forcing someone to be a parent against their will can be seen as unfair, especially if they were clear about their stance.\n\nThe ex's friends are calling the author selfish, which is a moral judgment. But the author is in a new relationship and life situation, and the unexpected responsibility is causing significant stress. The author's new partner is part of their current stability, and the situation is a major disruption.\n\nSo, legally, the author might be in trouble if they don't pay support. Morally, it's debatable. Some might say they have responsibility, others might agree that it's not fair to have a baby they didn't plan for. The key points are the legal obligations versus personal choice and the ethical implications of not providing for a child they helped create, despite not wanting to be a parent.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong morally because they were clear about their intentions, but legally, they might have obligations. The answer depends on whether the question is about moral wrong or legal wrong. Since the user asked if the author is in the wrong, maybe leaning towards moral. But the story mentions wanting to resign rights and responsibilities, which legally is possible but not easy. So the author is not in the wrong per se, but they might face legal consequences if they don't comply with support. But the initial question is if they are in the wrong, which is a moral judgment. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because of their initial clarity about not wanting kids and the situation being a surprise.\n"
