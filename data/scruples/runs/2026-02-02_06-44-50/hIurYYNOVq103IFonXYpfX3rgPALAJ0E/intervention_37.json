We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who had a relationship, broke up, then found out the ex is pregnant. He never wanted kids, they hadn't been in contact for months, and now he's considering a \"financial abortion\"\u2014meaning not taking any responsibility for the child, no support, no contact. His ex and her friends are calling him selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In most places, if you're the biological father, you're legally responsible for child support, even if you don't want to be involved. So he can't just walk away. Legally, he might be wrong if he tries to avoid his obligations. But the question is more about moral wrongness, not just legal.\n\nMoral-wise, is he in the wrong? Well, he didn't want kids, which is his choice, but now that there's a child, does he have a responsibility? Even if he didn't want the child, once it's born, the child has a right to support from both parents. So from a moral standpoint, not providing support could be seen as wrong. However, the ex is keeping the child, so he's being asked to take responsibility for a child he never wanted. That's a tough spot.\n\nBut he's also not in the position to force the mother to get an abortion or give up the child. So he's stuck. The ex's friends are judging him for not wanting to be a father. The man is trying to protect his current relationship and new life. \n\nIs it his fault the child exists? They were using contraceptives, but that can fail. So maybe neither is entirely at fault. But since he's the father, he has responsibilities. The key point here is whether it's moral to avoid those responsibilities just because he didn't want to be a father.\n\nIn many cultures, parental responsibility is considered a duty. Even if the pregnancy was unexpected, the child is now a part of his life, and denying support might be morally wrong. However, some might argue that he's not in the wrong because he didn't consent to the pregnancy. But once the child is born, the legal and moral obligations kick in regardless of consent.\n\nSo, putting it all together, legally he's likely in the wrong if he avoids responsibility, and morally, many would say yes, he is in the wrong because he has a duty to support the child. So the answer would be A.\n"
