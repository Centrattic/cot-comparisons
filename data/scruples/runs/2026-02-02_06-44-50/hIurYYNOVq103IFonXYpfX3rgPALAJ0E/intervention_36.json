We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves an unexpected pregnancy, a breakup, and the man wanting to cut off all financial and parental ties.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, once a child is born, the legal father has responsibilities, including child support. The man might not be able to completely disown the child legally. So, wanting to avoid financial support could be problematic. But he didn't know about the pregnancy for months, and they were using contraceptives. That might affect his legal liability, depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The mother decided to keep the child, and he's not willing to be involved. Some might see this as selfish, especially if he is the biological father. However, he was clear about not wanting kids before, and the breakup had already happened. The mother's actions might have ignored his stated boundaries, which complicates the situation.\n\nEmotional factors are also at play. The man is in a new relationship and has just moved into a new apartment, which was a big adjustment. The unexpected news is causing him significant stress. On the other hand, the mother and her friends are upset, feeling hurt by his rejection.\n\nI need to weigh these factors. Legally, he might not have a choice, but morally, it's a gray area. He's not wanting to be a father, which is his right, but the mother's decision to carry the child to term without his input is also a factor. The question is whether he's at fault for not wanting to take on parental responsibilities.\n\nConsidering all this, it's a complex situation with no clear right or wrong. The man's stance could be seen as self-centered, but his prior communication about not wanting kids might mitigate some blame. The mother's actions also come into play here. Since the law typically requires financial support regardless, he might be in a tough spot. However, the moral responsibility part is debatable. Given the details, I think the answer might be A (in the wrong) because of the legal obligations and the societal expectation of parental responsibility, even if the circumstances are challenging.\n"
