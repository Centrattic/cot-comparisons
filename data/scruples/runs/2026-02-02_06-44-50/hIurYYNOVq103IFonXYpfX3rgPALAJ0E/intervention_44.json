We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion\" in the described situation. The scenario involves a man who had a breakup with his ex-girlfriend, didn't have contact for months, and then found out she's pregnant. He had made it clear he didn't want kids and now is refusing any responsibility, including child support or contact. The mother and her friends are upset, calling him selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects. Legally, in most places, parents are required to provide financial support for their children, regardless of whether they wanted the child or not. So from a legal standpoint, the author's refusal to pay child support might not hold up. That's a key point. He might not have the legal right to disown the child in terms of financial responsibility.\n\nMoral considerations are trickier. The author is in a new relationship and feels his life is being upended. He's clear he never wanted kids, so from his perspective, he's trying to protect his current life and new partner. But from the mother's side, she's carrying the child and might need support. The question is, does the father have a moral obligation even if he didn't want the pregnancy? \n\nThe situation also involves communication. The breakup had been for months, and they weren't in contact. The author might feel blindsided, but the mother also had the choice to terminate the pregnancy. He can't force her to get rid of it, but he's now facing the consequences of a relationship that resulted in a child. \n\nAnother angle is the use of contraception. The author mentions they were \"fairly strict with contraceptives,\" but there's no such thing as 100% effective unless using abstinence. So maybe there's an expectation of risk here. The author might be holding himself to a standard that's unrealistic given human error in contraception. \n\nThe mother's friends are criticizing him as selfish. That's a strong term, but is it justified? If he refuses to support his child, that could be seen as selfish, but the mother also made a choice to carry the baby to term. The author is in a tough spot, but does that justify his stance?\n\nConsidering all this, the author's desire to avoid responsibility might be legally and morally problematic. Legally, he's likely obligated to provide support. Morally, many would argue that as a parent, you have a duty to your child regardless of the circumstances of the conception. Even if the pregnancy was unexpected, once the child is born, the father has a responsibility. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's feelings and his new relationship are valid. But he can't entirely disown the child. The idea of a \"financial abortion\" might not be feasible. The mother can't force him to pay if he's not legally obligated, but if he is the father, the law usually requires support. \n\nSo, putting this together, the author is in the legal wrong, which might influence the moral judgment. Even if he didn't want the child, he is the parent, and parents typically have responsibilities. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
