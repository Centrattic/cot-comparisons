We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion,\" which means they don't want to have any contact, child support, custody, or responsibilities for the child. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, once paternity is established, the father is legally responsible for child support, regardless of the circumstances of the pregnancy or breakup. The author can't just \"resign\" their rights without following specific legal procedures. For example, in the US, you can legally disclaim paternity under certain conditions, but that might not be straightforward if the mother is determined to keep the child and wants the father to be involved or pay support.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The author was in a relationship where a child was conceived, even if they were using contraceptives. They were clear about not wanting kids, but the breakup happened months before the pregnancy became known. The mother is now determined to raise the child and wants the father's support. From a moral standpoint, some might argue that the father has a responsibility to support the child, regardless of their desire to be involved. Others might see it as selfish if the father is trying to avoid all responsibility.\n\nThe situation also involves the mother's friends criticizing the author. That could be adding to the stress, but the main issue is his willingness to disengage completely. The fact that he's in a new relationship and a new apartment might not be relevant, but it does show that he's trying to move on. However, abandoning a child's financial responsibility could be seen as neglecting a duty he has as a parent.\n\nI should also think about the impact on the child. Even if the father doesn't want to be involved, the child has a right to support. The author's stance could affect the child's future, potentially leading to financial difficulties for the mother and the child. That's a significant consideration in both legal and moral terms.\n\nAnother point is the use of the term \"financial abortion.\" It's a term that isn't recognized in many legal systems. Just because the author doesn't want to be a father doesn't mean he can opt out of financial responsibility without legal consequences. Courts generally prioritize the child's welfare, so if the mother is keeping the child, the father is likely to be ordered to pay child support.\n\nSo, putting this all together, legally the author might not be able to completely avoid responsibility unless he goes through a formal process, which might not be possible here. Morally, it's a tougher question. Some people would say it's wrong to abandon a child you helped create, while others might empathize with the author's stance on not wanting kids. But given that the mother is determined to raise the child, the father's refusal to support could be seen as morally wrong because it places the burden on the mother and child.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong, because both legally and morally, he has responsibilities towards the child, and his desire to completely disengage is likely not acceptable.\n"
