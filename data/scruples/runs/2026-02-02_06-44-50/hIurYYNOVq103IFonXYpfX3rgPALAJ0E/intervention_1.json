We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong regarding a \"financial abortion.\" The author was in a relationship, didn't want kids, and the couple broke up. They didn't use contraceptives properly, leading to a pregnancy. Now, the author is trying to avoid financial responsibility and contact, which the mother and her friends are upset about.\n\nFirst, legally, in most places, a man can't just walk away from child support once the child is born. Even if he doesn't want custody or contact, he's still the legal father and would be required to provide support. So maybe the author is being unrealistic about the legal aspect. \n\nMoral arguments are trickier. The author doesn't want the child, and the breakup was months prior. But he was aware of his stance on kids before the relationship ended. Did he make that clear to his ex from the start? If he did, then maybe she knew the risks. However, pregnancy can happen even with contraceptives, so that's a factor. \n\nThe key points are: The author is trying to avoid responsibility after the fact, which might be seen as selfish. The mother wants to keep the child, and the author's refusal to support could impact both her and the child. Even if the author is stressed about his new relationship and apartment, the child's well-being is a consideration. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because he's prioritizing his own desires over the child's needs. Legally, he can't just resign responsibility, and morally, it's about the child's welfare. So the answer is A.\n"
