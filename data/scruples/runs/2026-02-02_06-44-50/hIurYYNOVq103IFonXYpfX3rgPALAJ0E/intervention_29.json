We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who dated a girl for a few months, then they broke up and had no contact for several months. Now she's pregnant and wants his support, but he never wanted kids and is refusing any responsibility. He's considering a \"financial abortion,\" which I think means not paying child support and cutting off all contact. He's been told he's selfish, and he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspects. In most places, if a man is found to be the biological father of a child, he is legally responsible for child support, even if he didn't want the child or the pregnancy. So if there's confirmation that he's the father through tests, he can't just walk away. Legally, he's probably obligated to pay child support. If he refuses, there could be legal consequences like being taken to court or losing certain rights. But maybe there's a legal way to do a financial abortion, like voluntarily giving up rights? I'm not sure. Adoption might be an option, but the mother is dead set on keeping the baby, so that's not happening. So he can't just legally resign all responsibilities. The legal answer here might be that he's not allowed to do that, so if he tries to avoid support, he might be in the wrong.\n\nThen there's the moral side. People might argue that once you're a parent, you have responsibilities, regardless of your initial intentions. Others might say that he was clear about not wanting kids, and she might have known that. But even if he was clear, if a baby is born, the father is still responsible. So morally, refusing to support a child you fathered could be seen as selfish. On the other hand, if he was honest from the start and they broke up, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. But since the pregnancy happened after the breakup, the mother's responsibility is there, but he's still the biological father. So maybe the moral question is whether he should be held responsible even if he didn't want the child. Some might say yes, others might empathize with his position, but the general consensus might be that he is in the wrong because he's avoiding his paternal duties.\n\nAlso, the fact that they were using contraceptives but still got pregnant. Maybe there was a failure or a mistake, but that doesn't absolve him of responsibility. The mother has the right to make decisions about the pregnancy, and he can't force her to get an abortion. But he's still responsible for the child if it's his. So if he's trying to avoid that, he's in the wrong. The friends calling him selfish might be right, but I can also see the stress he's under. However, societal expectations often place responsibility on the father, even if the father didn't want the child.\n\nI think the answer is that he's in the wrong because he's the father and thus has legal and moral responsibilities. Even if he doesn't want the child, he can't just walk away and refuse support. The \"financial abortion\" isn't a real legal option, and he's likely obligated to contribute. So refusing to do so would make him the asshole. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
