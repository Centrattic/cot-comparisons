We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who had a past relationship, broke up, and now the ex is pregnant. He never wanted kids, they haven't talked in months, and he's against getting back together. He's considering disavowing the child financially and wants to know if that's morally and legally okay.\n\nFirst, I need to check the legal aspects. In most places, when a man is the biological father, he can be held legally responsible for child support. Even if he doesn't want to be involved, he might still have to pay. There's a process for legal disestablishment of paternity, but that's not always straightforward. If the mother is determined to keep the child and he's the biological father, legally he might not have a way out of financial responsibility. So from a legal standpoint, he might be in trouble for trying to avoid it.\n\nMoral standpoint is trickier. The guy didn't want kids, but they were in a relationship where pregnancy could happen. He used contraceptives, but they failed. The question is whether he's morally responsible. Some might say that having a sexual relationship comes with the responsibility, even if you don't want kids. Others might argue that since they broke up and he was clear about not wanting children, it's unfair to hold him accountable. However, the fact that they were in a relationship and he was the father complicates things. Morally, some would say he's responsible because he contributed to the pregnancy, even if it was unintended.\n\nAlso, he's causing emotional distress to the mother. The mother's friends are calling him selfish, which might indicate societal judgment. His refusal to acknowledge the child could be seen as abandoning the mother and the child, which is often viewed negatively. \n\nBut there's also the argument that he has a new life with his current partner and a new apartment, and this could disrupt that. However, that's more about his personal situation rather than the rights of the child or the mother. \n\nIn summary, legally he's probably required to provide support, and morally, many would argue that being a parent is a responsibility once you're a parent, regardless of wanting it. So the answer is likely A, he is in the wrong because he's avoiding legal and moral responsibilities.\n"
