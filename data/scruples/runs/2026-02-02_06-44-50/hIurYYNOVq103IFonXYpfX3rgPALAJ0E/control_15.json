We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves an unexpected pregnancy after a breakup, and the author wants to avoid any financial or parental responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, when a man is determined to be the legal father, he's obligated to provide child support. So if he wants to avoid that, he might need to legally disown the child, which isn't straightforward. But does that make him in the wrong? Legally, maybe he's obligated regardless of his feelings.\n\nMorally, it's more complex. The woman is keeping the baby, and the author never wanted children. He's in a new relationship and doesn't want to be a father. But the child is his, so is it ethical to cut all ties? Some might argue that he has a responsibility, even if he didn't plan for it. Others might say that he should have been more careful with contraception, so he's partly at fault.\n\nThe mother's friends are calling him selfish. That's a common moral judgment. But if he was honest about not wanting kids, maybe he's not entirely wrong. However, the fact that they were using contraception and still ended up pregnant might play a role in how people view responsibility.\n\nAlso, the emotional impact on the mother is a factor. She's dealing with an unexpected pregnancy after a breakup, and he's rejecting any involvement. That could be seen as heartless. But the author is also stressed and in a new relationship, which he might see as a valid reason to refuse.\n\nI should also think about societal views. Some cultures emphasize parental responsibility regardless of circumstances, while others might be more lenient. The term \"financial abortion\" is a way to distance himself from the responsibility without the child being terminated, which is a gray area.\n\nIn the end, it's a mix of legal obligations and moral judgments. Legally, he might be required to pay child support unless he can legally disclaim paternity, which is possible in some jurisdictions only under certain conditions. Morally, opinions could be split between those who think he's selfish and those who believe he's being honest about his desires.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? The question is asking for a yes or no based on the analysis. Considering that he's being legally obligated to support the child, and morally, some might see him as avoiding responsibility, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong). However, others might argue that he was upfront about not wanting kids. But given the situation, the majority might side with the mother having the right to the child and the father having responsibilities, so the author is in the wrong.\n"
