We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author dated a girl for a few months, then they broke up and had no contact for months. Then she comes back saying she's pregnant, and the kid is his. The author made it clear he never wanted kids, so he's not interested in getting back together or being involved. He's now in a new relationship and is panicking, wanting to avoid any financial responsibility for the child. The question is whether he's in the wrong by wanting a \"financial abortion\"\u2014meaning he doesn't want to pay child support, have contact, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, once a man is legally recognized as the father (which they've confirmed through tests), he is legally obligated to pay child support regardless of his wishes. So he can't just resign his rights if the mother doesn't agree to a termination or adoption. Legally, he might have no choice but to be involved financially. But maybe he can voluntarily give up rights, but that usually requires the mother's consent and court approval. If the mother wants to keep the child, he might not be able to avoid it.\n\nMoral aspects are trickier. The author is being accused of selfishness. But he argues he never wanted kids and was clear about that. However, the break-up happened months before the pregnancy, so maybe he's still responsible for the consequences of his actions during a relationship. Contraceptives failed, which is a risk in relationships. The mother is choosing to keep the child, so he's expected to help financially. But he's not in a position to do so, given his new relationship and moving into a new apartment. \n\nOn the other hand, if he was clear about not wanting children, maybe he should have been more cautious in the relationship. But the mother also might have considered that before getting pregnant. However, once pregnant, she has the right to carry the child to term. So he's stuck with financial responsibility. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot, but legally and morally, he's probably not allowed to avoid support. The mother's friends are calling him selfish, which might be justified if he's trying to avoid responsibility. But he's also dealing with a situation he didn't expect. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Legally, he might not have a choice. Morally, if he's responsible for the child's existence, then he has some obligation. But the initial breakup and the lack of contact might affect that. However, once the child is born, the father's rights and responsibilities kick in. So, the author is likely in the wrong if he's trying to avoid support when it's legally required. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
