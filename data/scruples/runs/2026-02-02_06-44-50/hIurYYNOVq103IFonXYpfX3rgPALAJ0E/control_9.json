We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. The user is asking for an A or B answer, where A means the author is in the wrong and B means they're not. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author dated a girl for a few months, and it seemed like it could be long-term. Then they had months of no contact. The girl then contacts him saying she's pregnant. The author was clear he never wanted kids. He shut down the idea of getting back together, and now wants to avoid any financial or parental responsibilities, even referring to it as a \"financial abortion.\" The mother's friends are calling him selfish. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspects. In many places, fathers do have legal responsibilities regarding child support once paternity is established. The author mentions that tests have confirmed he's the father. So legally, he might be required to provide support, which he doesn't want to do. So from a legal standpoint, he might be in the wrong if he refuses to pay child support without a court order to terminate his parental rights.\n\nMorally, it's more complex. The author states he never wanted kids and that the pregnancy was unexpected. He has a new girlfriend and a new apartment, which suggests his life has moved on. The mother was in contact after a breakup, and he rejected the idea of reconciling. Morally, some might argue that he has a responsibility to the child, regardless of his personal desires. Others might say that since he didn't want the relationship to continue and the child was not planned, he shouldn't be forced to support it.\n\nHowever, the term \"financial abortion\" is controversial. It implies ending the financial responsibility, but not the pregnancy itself. Legally, a father can't just walk away from a child. He might need to go through a legal process to terminate parental rights, which is not always possible and usually requires showing that it's in the child's best interest. If he doesn't pursue that legally and just refuses to pay, he could be in violation of the law.\n\nThe mother's friends are calling him selfish, which is a moral judgment. Whether he's selfish or in the wrong legally depends on the laws in his jurisdiction. If he's not taking the legal steps to relinquish his rights properly, he might be in the wrong. But if he's trying to navigate it legally, maybe there's a different take.\n\nSo, considering both legal and moral aspects, the author might be in the wrong because he's avoiding responsibilities that come with being a parent once paternity is established. Legally, he can't unilaterally decide not to support the child. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
