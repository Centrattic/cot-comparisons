We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe person dated a girl for a few months, but they broke up and hadn't talked for months. Then the girl comes back saying she's pregnant and wants support. The person had made it clear they never wanted kids. They didn't want to get back together, and now they're considering not taking any financial responsibility for the child, hence the \"financial abortion.\" The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to avoid child support and all responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, fathers have legal responsibilities towards their children, even if they weren't involved initially. Denying paternity might be possible if there's doubt, but the user mentioned DNA tests have confirmed it's their child. If that's the case, legally, they might be obligated to pay child support regardless of their feelings. So legally, they might not have a choice, but the user is asking about being in the wrong, which is more of a moral question.\n\nMoral-wise, this is tricky. The person is in a tough spot because they didn't want children, and the pregnancy happened after a breakup. They might feel like they were set up for something they never wanted. However, the mother had the choice to terminate the pregnancy or consider adoption. She decided to keep the baby. The father, once the parent is established, has responsibilities. Denying support could be seen as selfish, especially if the child is theirs. On the other hand, the father had made his stance clear. But once the child is born, the responsibilities are more fixed in many societies.\n\nThe user's new girlfriend and new life might be a factor in their distress. But the key point is that the child exists, and the father's options are limited. The mother's friends are calling him selfish, which is a moral judgment. The question is whether the user is in the wrong. \n\nI think from a moral standpoint, once the father's paternity is confirmed, he has a responsibility to support the child. Refusing child support could be seen as morally wrong, even if he didn't want the child. The mother could have chosen otherwise, but the father is still a parent and thus has obligations. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
