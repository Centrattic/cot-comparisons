We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation involving an unexpected pregnancy. The author is considering a \"financial abortion,\" which I think refers to cutting all ties and refusing to pay child support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, when a man is determined to be the father, especially if acknowledged or proven through testing, he's legally obligated to provide child support. So the author can't just refuse that. Legally, he's probably on shaky ground.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The mother is keeping the child, and the father's responsibilities don't end just because he didn't want the child. Even if the pregnancy was unexpected, the child is now going to need support. The author's new relationship and new apartment might make him feel like he's starting over, but the child's needs are a separate issue. \n\nThe mother's friends are calling him selfish, which might be valid. Denying the child financial support could affect the child's well-being, even if the author doesn't want to be involved. There's also the aspect of the child having the right to know their parent and to have resources. \n\nThe author mentions they were using contraceptives, but no method is 100% effective. Both parties might share responsibility for the pregnancy. However, once the child is born, the father's responsibilities are a given in most societies. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's avoiding legal and moral obligations towards the child. Even if the situation is difficult for him, the child's needs and rights should be considered. The answer should be A.\n"
