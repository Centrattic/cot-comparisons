We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me start by understanding the details.\n\nThe author had a relationship with a girl for a few months, and it was looking like a long-term thing. But things went bad, and they had no contact for a while. Then she contacted him, saying she's pregnant and wants his support. The author didn't want kids and was clear about that. He refused to get back together, made it clear he doesn't want to be a father, and hung up. The mother is keeping the baby, and the child is his. He's now in a new relationship, moving into a new apartment, and this news has really thrown him off. He's considering a \"financial abortion,\" meaning not paying child support, not having contact, no custody rights. His reasoning is that he never wanted kids, he can't handle it, and he doesn't want to be forced into fatherhood. Her friends are calling him selfish and an asshole, and he's asking if he's the asshole for wanting this.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspects. In most places, if you're the biological father, you are legally responsible for child support, even if you don't want to be involved. So just walking away and refusing to pay could lead to legal consequences. But maybe he can legally terminate his parental rights? That's more complicated. Usually, you can't just unilaterally give up rights; there's a legal process involving the court, and it's not always allowed. Also, the mother would have to agree, and the child's best interest is considered. So legally, he might not be able to do that, and if he refuses to pay, he could be sued. So maybe the legal part isn't on his side.\n\nThen the moral side. He was in a relationship where they were using contraception but it failed. He was clear about not wanting kids, so maybe she should have taken that into account. However, once a child is conceived, the father does have responsibilities, even if he didn't want it. The idea of a \"financial abortion\" is controversial. Some might say it's selfish because the child has a right to support from both parents. Others might argue that if the father is not involved in the pregnancy and made his stance clear, he shouldn't be forced to support the child. But morally, there's a debate. The mother's friends are upset because they see his refusal as abandoning the child, which could be seen as morally wrong. \n\nAlso, the fact that they used contraception but it failed. Maybe they both took some risk, but if he was up front about not wanting kids, maybe she should have been more cautious. However, even with precautions, there's a chance of failure, and it's not entirely his fault. But once the child exists, the responsibilities are there. \n\nThe author's current situation is moving into a new apartment with his new girlfriend, which might imply he's financially stable. If he refuses support, it could impact the mother's ability to raise the child. But he's also under stress and not prepared for fatherhood. \n\nSo legally, he's probably in the wrong because he can't just walk away from child support. Morally, it's a gray area. Some might see his stance as selfish, others might understand his position given his prior statements. But since he can't unilaterally terminate rights, and he's refusing to support the child without legal justification, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong). However, if the mother had known his stance and still continued the pregnancy, maybe she's responsible? But that's not a common legal standpoint. Usually, paternity is established regardless of prior intentions. \n\nI think the key points are: he was clear about not wanting kids, but he is now the father. Legally, he has responsibilities. Morally, it's debatable, but some people might argue that once a child exists, the father has a duty. So the answer is likely A, but I need to be careful. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The community in the AITA subreddit would probably say he is, because he's trying to avoid responsibility for a child. But I should check if any exceptions apply. For example, if he was unclear about his intentions or if there's a legal way out. However, the story says he was \"clear as day\" about not wanting kids. Maybe she didn't take that seriously, but if the law says he's responsible, then he's in the wrong to want to avoid that. So the answer is A.\n"
