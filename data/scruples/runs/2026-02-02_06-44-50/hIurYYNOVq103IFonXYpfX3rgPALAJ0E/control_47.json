We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation involves an unexpected pregnancy, the author's stance on not wanting children, and their desire to avoid financial responsibility, hence the \"financial abortion.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, when a child is born, both parents have legal responsibilities, including child support. Even if the father wants no part in the child's life, the law might still require him to contribute financially. So the author's desire to cut off all ties and avoid support could be legally problematic. They might not have the right to disclaim paternity if it's legally established.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The author is clear they never wanted children and are in a new relationship. However, the mother is determined to keep the child. The author's refusal to be involved could be seen as selfish because the child, once born, is a human being with needs. Morally, some might argue that every child deserves support from both parents, regardless of the parents' relationship. Others might empathize with the father's position if he's adamant about not wanting children, but that doesn't necessarily absolve him of responsibility.\n\nEmotionally, the author is clearly stressed and in shock. The mother's friends are criticizing him, calling him selfish. This adds to the tension. But the key issue is responsibility. Even if the conception was accidental, once the child is born, the father can't just walk away legally or morally in most societies. There's a societal expectation that both parents contribute to a child's well-being.\n\nThe author mentions they were using contraceptives, but accidents happen. However, that doesn't negate the responsibility once the child is born. The concept of a \"financial abortion\" isn't recognized legally in many places; once paternity is confirmed, child support is typically mandatory. The author can't unilaterally decide to opt out without legal consequences.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in a tough spot, but legally and morally, they are likely in the wrong for wanting to disavow all responsibility. They can't ignore their legal obligations, and morally, the child deserves support. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
