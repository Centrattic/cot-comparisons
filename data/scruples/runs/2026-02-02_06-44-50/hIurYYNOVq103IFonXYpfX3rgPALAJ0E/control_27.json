We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who had a relationship, they broke up, and now the ex is pregnant. He doesn't want kids and is considering a \"financial abortion,\" meaning no child support, no contact, no custody.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, fathers are legally obligated to provide child support once paternity is established. Even if the father doesn't want to be involved, the law often requires financial responsibility. So, legally, he might be required to pay child support regardless of his feelings. That's a key point.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The mother wants to keep the baby, and he's refusing any responsibility. Some might argue that as the father, even if the relationship is over, he has a moral obligation to support a child he helped create. Others might say that if he never wanted kids and was clear about that, he shouldn't be forced to support a child against his will. But morality can be subjective here.\n\nThe user's actions: He shut down the idea of getting back together, which the ex might see as abandonment. His friends are calling him selfish. On the other hand, he's prioritizing his new relationship and current life, which he has a right to, but it's causing conflict.\n\nI should also consider the context. They were in a relationship but had been broken up for months. The use of contraceptives but still a pregnancy. Maybe they had a lapse in birth control, but he might feel it's her responsibility. However, in some cases, both parties are responsible for contraception.\n\nLegally, he can't just disown the child. He might have to go through a formal process to terminate parental rights, which is difficult and not typically granted unless there's abuse or neglect. So, his desire to have a \"financial abortion\" might not be legally feasible. That's a point against him, as he might be in the wrong legally.\n\nMoral judgment is tricky. If he's being legally responsible but is avoiding emotional and financial support, that could be seen as selfish. However, if he's being forced to support a child he never wanted, that's a different perspective. But in most societies, parental responsibility is expected once paternity is confirmed, whether the parents are together or not.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, he's probably in the wrong because he can't unilaterally decide not to provide child support. Morally, some might see him as selfish, others might empathize with his stance. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, so the answer likely is A (yes), because he's avoiding legal and moral responsibilities.\n"
