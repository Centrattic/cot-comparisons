We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a guy who had a relationship that ended, then found out the ex is pregnant. He never wanted kids, they broke up, and now he's considering not paying child support and cutting contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, once a man is determined to be the father, he's legally responsible for child support. Even if the parents aren't together, the father usually has obligations. So if he wants to cut ties, legally it might not work. He can't just resign rights unless there's a specific legal process, which varies by jurisdiction. So legally, he might be in trouble if he ignores the responsibility.\n\nMorally, it's tricky. On one hand, he didn't want children and they broke up. On the other, the child is his, and denying support could affect the child's well-being. The mother might be struggling, and the father's refusal could put pressure on her. However, the father also has his own life and decisions made during the relationship, like using contraceptives. But the fact remains that the child exists now, and he's the biological father.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I should check if the author's actions are justified. He's not forcing the mother to keep the baby, but he's unwilling to help. The mother's friends are calling him selfish, which could be right because children have rights to support from both parents. The author might be acting out of fear or not wanting to commit, but that doesn't absolve him legally or morally.\n\nAlso, the author is in a new relationship, which might add to his stress, but it's not a valid reason to abandon responsibility. The situation is complex, but the key points are legal obligations and the child's welfare. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong, because he's avoiding legal and moral responsibilities.\n"
