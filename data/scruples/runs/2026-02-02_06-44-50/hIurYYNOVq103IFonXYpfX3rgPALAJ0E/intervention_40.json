We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to avoid financial responsibility for a child they didn't want. The situation involves a past relationship where the couple broke up, had no contact, and then the ex became pregnant. The author is now in a new relationship and is financially stable, but they don't want any kids. They want to disavow all responsibility, including child support, and are being criticized for being selfish.\n\nFirst, legally, in most places, fathers have financial responsibilities once paternity is established. The author can't just resign those rights without legal consequences. Legally, they might be wrong because the law typically requires support regardless of desire for the child. So the author might be wrong in thinking they can avoid that.\n\nMoral-wise, it's more complex. The author didn't want kids, but they are the biological father. Some people might argue that once you create a life, you have a responsibility, even if unintended. Others might say the author had no intention of parenthood and the mother should have been more cautious with birth control. However, the fact that they used contraceptives doesn't negate the outcome if they failed. The mother also has responsibilities, but the father is still legally bound in most cases.\n\nThe author's refusal to engage could be seen as selfish, but they're also dealing with emotional trauma and a new relationship. However, the mother's friends are criticizing them, which adds to the conflict. The key points are legal obligations, moral responsibility, and the impact on the mother and potential child.\n\nLegally, the author is likely in the wrong for wanting to avoid child support. Morally, it's a gray area. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because legally they can't disavow responsibility, and morally, some would argue they have a duty to support their child, even if unintended.\n"
