We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the author dated a girl, and they broke up after a few months. They didn't speak for a while, then the ex reaches out saying she's pregnant. The author was clear they never wanted kids. Now, she wants to keep the baby, and the author is considering a \"financial abortion,\" meaning cutting off all responsibility and contact, not paying child support, etc. His new partner and new apartment are mentioned, showing his current life is stable and he's trying to move on.\n\nThe key points here are legal and moral responsibilities. Legally, in many places, fathers are obligated to provide child support regardless of their willingness. So the author can't just opt out of that legally. Morally, it's more nuanced. The author didn't want children, and the pregnancy happened despite contraception. But he's the biological father, which does come with certain responsibilities in most societies.\n\nThe ex's friends are calling him selfish, which adds social pressure. But is he in the wrong? From a legal standpoint, he's definitely obligated. Morally, some might say that having a child brings responsibilities, even if the father didn't plan for it. On the other hand, he's not the one who decided to keep the child; that was the mother's choice. However, being a biological parent often entails some level of responsibility.\n\nThe author is in a tough spot, but wanting to avoid all responsibility might not be acceptable. Even if he didn't want the child, the child is a human being with needs. So while his feelings are valid, cutting off completely might be seen as morally wrong. Legally, he can't do it. So the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's avoiding responsibilities that come with parenthood, even if he didn't plan for it.\n"
