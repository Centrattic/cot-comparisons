We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a financial abortion. First, I need to understand the situation clearly. The author had a relationship that ended months ago, and then the ex-partner revealed she's pregnant. The author never wanted kids and is now refusing any responsibility, including child support. He's in a new relationship and feels this is causing him a lot of stress. His ex and her friends are calling him selfish.\n\nSo, the key points here are: legal responsibility, moral responsibility, and the ethical implications. Legally, in many places, fathers do have to provide financial support for their children, regardless of wanting the child or not. So the author might not have a legal option to disown the child. But he's asking if it's morally right. Morally, some might argue that a person has a responsibility to support their child, even if they didn't plan for it. Others might say that the author is being realistic about his own life and not wanting to be a parent. \n\nHowever, the author is considering cutting off all contact and not providing support, which could be seen as abandoning the child. Even if he doesn't want a relationship, child support is often a legal requirement. So, the author might be in the wrong legally, but the question is about morality. The user might be looking for a judgment on whether his stance is morally acceptable.\n\nThe ex is pushing for him to get back together, which he refused. But the author's main issue is financial responsibility. The problem is that he might not have the right to disavow responsibility entirely. Even if he doesn't want to be a father, the law usually doesn't allow that. So, morally, some might say he's being selfish by not supporting the child, while others might empathize with his situation. However, the fact that they were using contraception and are unsure how the pregnancy happened might affect perceptions. But regardless, once the child is born, parental responsibilities often kick in.\n\nSo, the answer would depend on societal norms and personal ethics. But in most cases, people expect that a biological father has some responsibility. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong morally for refusing all responsibility. Legally, he might not have that option, but morally, the answer leans towards A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
