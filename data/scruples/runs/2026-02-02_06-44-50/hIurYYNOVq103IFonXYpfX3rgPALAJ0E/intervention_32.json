We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a man who had a brief relationship, broke up, and then found out his ex is pregnant. He doesn't want kids, refuses to be involved, and wants to avoid financial responsibility. The community is divided, but the user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, fathers are legally responsible for child support once paternity is established, even if they don't want to be involved. So legally, the author might not have a choice. But the user is asking about moral responsibility here, not just legal. \n\nMorally, the argument is about responsibility. The author was part of creating life, even if it was unintentional. The ex is keeping the baby, and the father argues he never consented to parenthood. However, some might say that by engaging in a sexual relationship where pregnancy was a possibility, he shares responsibility. The author claims they were using contraception, but no method is 100% effective. \n\nThe author's new partner and new life might make him feel overwhelmed, but that doesn't negate the responsibility. The ex's friends are calling him selfish, which suggests others see his stance as morally wrong. However, there's also the argument that the author has the right to refuse, but the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not just whether it's possible.\n\nI think the key points are the legal obligation versus personal choice. Legally, he might have to pay, but morally, the community might see him as avoiding responsibility. The user thinks he's wrong, and I can see that perspective. Even if he didn't plan for kids, he's part of the parent, so cutting off all responsibility could be seen as selfish. But then again, if the pregnancy happened despite precautions, maybe he's not entirely at fault. \n\nBut in terms of ethical responsibility, once a child is born, the father has a duty towards it, regardless of whether he wanted it. So the author wanting to disengage completely might be morally in the wrong. The answer would likely be A, he is in the wrong. But I need to make sure I'm not conflating legal and moral. The user is asking about being in the wrong, which is more about morality. So even if the law forces him to pay, morally, people might think he should accept some responsibility. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
