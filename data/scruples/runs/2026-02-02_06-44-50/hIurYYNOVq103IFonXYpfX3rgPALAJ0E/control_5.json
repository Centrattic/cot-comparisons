We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a man who's being asked to take financial responsibility for a child he didn't plan for, after a breakup. He doesn't want kids, they were using contraceptives, and now he wants to avoid any responsibility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, fathers have legal obligations to support their children, even if they don't want to be involved. So legally, he might be required to pay child support. But he's asking if it's morally and legally okay to avoid that. Legally, probably not. So he might be in the wrong if he tries to avoid responsibilities.\n\nMoral standpoint is trickier. Some might say that once a child is born, the father has a responsibility regardless of circumstances. Others might argue that the mother should have been more cautious with birth control, but that's a sensitive area. The fact that they were using contraceptives but it failed complicates things. However, the mother did decide to keep the child, so she's committed to raising it. The man's refusal to support could be seen as selfish, especially if the mother is now relying on him.\n\nHe's also causing emotional distress to the mother and her friends are criticizing him. That's another point against him. He's being called selfish, which might indicate that society views his stance as morally wrong.\n\nBut he's also in a new relationship and his life was upended. His perspective is that he never wanted kids and the situation is beyond his control. However, the fact remains that he's the biological father. So even if he doesn't want to be involved, the legal and moral expectations usually place some responsibility on him.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
