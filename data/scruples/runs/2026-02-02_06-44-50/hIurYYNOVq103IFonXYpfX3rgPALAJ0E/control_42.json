We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong regarding their stance on financial responsibility for a child they don't want. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, when a man is the legal father of a child, he's obligated to provide financial support regardless of his desire to be involved. The key here is that the pregnancy was confirmed, and he's the biological father. Legally, he might not have a choice in the matter. So wanting to cut off all ties might not hold up in court. That could be a factor in whether he's in the wrong, especially if he's refusing child support.\n\nNext, the moral angle. The author is clear that they never wanted kids, and the relationship was already over before the pregnancy. Morally, some might argue that the child isn't their fault and they have a responsibility to support the child's life. Others might see it as selfish to walk away, but if they don't want to be a parent, maybe they feel the mother should take sole responsibility. However, in most societies, there's an expectation that biological fathers share in the financial burden, even if they don't want to be involved otherwise.\n\nThe situation also mentions that the mother's friends are calling him selfish. That's a social judgment, but the user is asking about being in the wrong. The mother might have the right to press for legal action if he doesn't comply with child support. The author's refusal to pay could lead to legal consequences, which would imply he's in the wrong legally, but the question is about whether he's the asshole morally and legally. \n\nContraceptives were used, but they failed. The author might feel this wasn't their intention, but that doesn't negate the financial responsibility. The fact that the pregnancy occurred despite precautions might make the situation more complicated, but legally, the responsibility is still on the father. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's unwilling to take on the legal and moral responsibilities of fatherhood, even if he doesn't want to be part of the child's life. The legal obligation for child support is a key point here, but the moral aspect is also significant. However, the user is asking for a choice between A and B. Legal and moral responsibilities often intersect, so even if the mother's friends are being harsh, the author's refusal to pay is not legally permissible. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
