We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion,\" meaning not being involved in the child's life, not paying child support, etc. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, once paternity is established, a man is legally obligated to pay child support. The father can't just walk away from that responsibility, even if he didn't want the child. So legally, he might be in for some trouble if he refuses.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The mother is keeping the child, and he's the biological father. Even if the relationship ended and he's in a new relationship, he's part of the child's genetic makeup. Some people might argue that he has a responsibility to the child, regardless of his personal desires. On the flip side, others might say that if he made it clear he didn't want kids, and the mother proceeded without his consent, maybe he's not entirely at fault. However, consent to parenthood isn't just about wanting a child; once a child is born, the legal and moral obligations often kick in.\n\nThe user's original stance is that the author is in the wrong. They mention that the author is selfish and hurting the mother by refusing to acknowledge the child. But the author is also in a tough spot, having moved on with his life. It's a complex situation with emotional and legal layers.\n\nI should also think about the mother's actions. She reconnected after months of no contact and then became pregnant. Even if they were using contraceptives, there's a chance of failure. However, the author had made his stance on not wanting kids clear. The mother might have known that, which complicates things. But that doesn't necessarily absolve the father of responsibility once a child is involved.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, some might say that life is a chance, and the father should take responsibility for his actions. Others might argue that the mother should have considered the father's wishes more carefully. But the key point is that once the child is born, the father can't just opt out of being a parent. So morally, wanting to cut ties and not pay support might be seen as inconsiderate or selfish, even if he didn't want the child.\n\nPutting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong both morally and legally. He can't avoid the responsibilities of parenthood once paternity is established. So the answer is A.\n"
