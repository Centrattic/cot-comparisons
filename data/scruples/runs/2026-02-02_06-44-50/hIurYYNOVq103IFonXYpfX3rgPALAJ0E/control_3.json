We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a financial abortion. First, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author had a relationship that ended months ago. Then the ex girlfriend contacts him, saying she's pregnant and wants support. The author clearly didn't want kids and ended the relationship. Now, he's in a new relationship and wants to cut all ties, including financial responsibility for the child. The ex and her friends are upset, calling him selfish. The question is: is he the asshole?\n\nLegally, in most jurisdictions, a father does have financial responsibilities towards a child, even if he doesn't want to be involved. Denying paternity could lead to legal challenges, especially if tests confirm he's the father. So legally, he might not be able to just opt out. But the question is about morality, not just law.\n\nMorally, it's tricky. On one hand, the author didn't want kids and the relationship ended. On the other, if he's the father, many would argue he has a responsibility to the child. But the user's perspective is about his personal well-being. He's in a new relationship, moving into a new apartment, and this is causing him trauma.\n\nThe ex's friends are criticizing him as selfish. Is that fair? The author isn't refusing to let the mother keep the baby; he's just not wanting any part in it. But the child is a human being, so his stance might be seen as neglecting responsibility. However, if the mother can support the child herself, maybe his refusal isn't the worst thing. But if she can't, the child might suffer.\n\nAlso, the author's assertion that they were \"fairly strict with contraceptives\"\u2014maybe they failed, but that doesn't absolve responsibility. The key points are consent and responsibility. The author didn't want the child, but once a child exists, there are responsibilities. However, in some places, if a man doesn't acknowledge paternity, he might not be legally obligated unless proven otherwise. But if it's proven, he can be made to pay child support.\n\nSo, morally, is he in the wrong? Some people might say yes because he's shirking responsibility. Others might say he's being honest about his inability to handle fatherhood. But the argument against him is that the child is being born and needs support. The mother might need help, but he's refusing any help. That's where the conflict arises.\n\nThe AITA (Am I the Asshole) format usually leans towards communal standards. The community might side with the mother, especially if the author is cutting off all support when the child is his. But if the mother can handle it, maybe not. The author's refusal to pay could be seen as selfish, even if he doesn't want to be a parent. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because of the child's needs, but B (not in the wrong) because of personal choice. The user is conflicted but the community might lean towards A."
