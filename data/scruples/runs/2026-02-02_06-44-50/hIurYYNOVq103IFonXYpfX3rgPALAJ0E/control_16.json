We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person in the story is the asshole for wanting to avoid financial responsibility for a child they didn't want. The situation is they had a breakup months ago, then the ex contacts them saying she's pregnant. The author made it clear they never wanted kids, they had been using contraceptives, but now they want to disavow any responsibility, including child support and contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both legal and moral aspects. Legally, in most places, if paternity is confirmed, the father is responsible for child support. Even if they don't want custody, they can't just walk away from the financial responsibilities. So the author would likely be required by law to pay child support, which would mean their plan isn't legally okay.\n\nMorally, this is trickier. The author claims they never wanted kids and had a clear breakup, but they had a sexual relationship where a child was conceived. Some argue that once a child is born, the father has a responsibility regardless of the circumstances. Others might say that if the father was clear about not wanting children, the mother should have taken full responsibility. But the mother also claims she wants to keep the baby, so maybe she wanted the child regardless. The author's refusal might be seen as selfish because the child isn't at fault, but this can be a point of contention depending on societal views.\n\nThe author's new relationship and moving into a new apartment might add to the stress, but that doesn't necessarily absolve them of responsibility. The ex's friends are calling them selfish, which is a common reaction, but the author's stance is about not wanting to be a parent. The key issue is whether the author is morally and legally justified in avoiding financial support.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because legally they can't avoid support, and morally, the child's well-being is often considered a responsibility even if the parent isn't involved. However, some might argue the mother should take full responsibility if the father was clear. But in most jurisdictions, both parents are responsible unless a legal termination of parental rights is done, which is rare and requires specific circumstances. Therefore, the author's desire to avoid all responsibility is likely wrong.\n"
