We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who had a past relationship, broke up, and then found out the ex is pregnant. He never wanted kids, they haven't been in contact for months, and now she wants him to be involved. He wants to completely disengage, no financial support, no contact, etc. The question is whether he's in the wrong, with options A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider both moral and legal aspects. Legally, in many places, fathers have financial responsibilities even if they don't want to be involved. So if he's a biological father, he might legally have to pay child support. But the user is also asking about moral aspects. \n\nMorally, this is more complex. The guy didn't want kids, they broke up, and now the ex is pregnant. He's not trying to force an abortion or adoption, just stepping away. But some might argue that he's responsible for the child's well-being, even if he's not ready to be a parent. Others might say that if he made it clear he didn't want kids, and they were using contraception, then it's not entirely his fault. However, since he is the father, some might think he has a duty regardless of his initial intentions.\n\nAlso, the ex and her friends are calling him selfish. There's a conflict between his personal desires and the child's needs. The new relationship and moving into a new apartment might make him feel overwhelmed, but that doesn't necessarily excuse his stance. \n\nI should check if there's a legal option for disavowing paternity. If he can legally disclaim, maybe that's an option. But if he can't, then refusing to pay could be illegal. Legally, he might be in a tight spot. Morally, it's about taking responsibility versus personal choice. \n\nIn many places, you can't just opt out of child support if you're a biological parent. So legally, he might not have a choice. Morally, it's tricky. Some people would say he's in the wrong for not supporting the child, others would say he's being honest about his inability to be a parent. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides. The answer might depend on the legal framework and personal ethics. Since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer would be A or B. Considering that he's not forcing anyone to make decisions but is refusing to take on responsibility, some might say he's in the wrong. Others might be more understanding of his stance given the circumstances. So it's a close call, but I think the answer is A (yes, in the wrong) because of the responsibility a parent has, even if they don't want to be involved.\n"
