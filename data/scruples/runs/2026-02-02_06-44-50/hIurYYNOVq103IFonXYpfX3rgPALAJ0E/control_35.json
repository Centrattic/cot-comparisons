We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who dated a girl, they broke up, and now she's pregnant. He didn't want kids, and he doesn't want to be involved financially or otherwise. He's considering a \"financial abortion,\" which I think refers to legally waiving his parental rights to avoid child support.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the legal aspects. I remember that in many jurisdictions, you can't just walk away from a child you fathered. Even if you don't want to be involved, you might still be legally responsible for child support. There might be ways to terminate parental rights, but that's not automatic. It usually requires the mother's consent or some compelling circumstances, like abuse or abandonment. The mother in this case is dead set on keeping the baby, so she probably wouldn't agree. Legally, he might be stuck with some responsibilities.\n\nThen, the moral aspect. The guy claims he never wanted kids, which is his right, but he's also responsible for the child's existence. Arguably, he has a duty to support the child even if he's not part of the child's life. On the other hand, he's in a new relationship and just moved, so this is a huge disruption. The mother's friends are calling him selfish, which might be valid if he's unwilling to take any responsibility. But is it his responsibility? If they were using contraceptives properly, maybe there's an argument that it was an accident beyond his control. However, that doesn't absolve him of financial responsibility.\n\nI should check if there's such a thing as a \"financial abortion.\" It might be a term for voluntarily terminating parental rights, but I think in practice, that's hard without the mother's consent. Also, even if he waives rights, child support might still be mandated by law unless he can prove the child isn't his. But the tests show it is his, so he can't avoid that.\n\nThe user is asking if he's the asshole. From a moral standpoint, some people might see him as selfish for not helping. But others might empathize with his stance on not wanting kids. Legally, he's likely not in the clear if he tries to avoid support. So, is he in the wrong? It's a bit complex. The answer probably depends on the legal system, but morally, he might be seen as not taking responsibility, which could make him the asshole. However, the situation is not black and white. The mother is keeping the child, and he's not refusing care, just financial support. But the child is his, so he might have some obligations. I think the answer is A (he is in the wrong) because he's avoiding responsibility after creating a situation he might have contributed to, even if they broke up. The term \"financial abortion\" is legally tricky, and he's likely required to support the child.\n"
