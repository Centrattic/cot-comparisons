We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who had a brief relationship, they broke up, and now the ex is pregnant. He never wanted kids, they were using contraceptives, and he's refusing any responsibility, wanting a \"financial abortion.\" His new girlfriend and their new apartment are mentioned, and he's been criticized by the ex's friends for being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many jurisdictions, fathers do have legal obligations regarding child support, regardless of their willingness. Even if he wants to disown the child, the law might not allow that. So legally, he might be wrong. But the question is about being in the wrong morally and socially.\n\nMoral perspective: The man is responsible for the child's existence. Even if the pregnancy was unexpected, he's part of the equation. Refusing all responsibility could be seen as selfish, especially since the child is a person with needs. The mother is carrying the child, but the father's role in creating the situation is undeniable. On the other hand, he had clearly stated he didn't want kids, and they were using birth control. If the pregnancy was due to a failure in contraception, maybe he's not entirely at fault, but he still has to face the consequences.\n\nSocial context: The ex's friends are calling him selfish. Society often holds that fathers should support their children, even if the relationship is over. However, there's also a debate about the rights of the father to disengage, especially if the relationship was already dissolved. The fact that they had months of no contact complicates things. Did she try to reconnect and get support before the pregnancy was known? If she reached out after the breakup, maybe she had some responsibility in maintaining communication.\n\nEmotional impact: The man is clearly stressed, which is understandable. But the mother is also dealing with a pregnancy and the emotional fallout of the breakup. His refusal might make it harder for her, especially if she's planning to keep the child.\n\nLegally, he can't just disown the child. Child support laws are there to ensure the child's well-being. So regardless of his feelings, he might be legally obligated. That would mean he's in the wrong from a legal standpoint, but the question is about moral wrongness. \n\nIs it morally okay? It's complicated. If the father refuses support, the child's needs might not be met. However, if the mother can support the child on her own, maybe. But society generally expects both parents to contribute. The man's stance could be seen as avoiding responsibility. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of consent and the circumstances. He didn't want kids, they were using birth control. If the pregnancy was an accident, is he still obligated? Some might argue that the responsibility of contraception is shared, and if it failed, both are accountable. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong). Even though the situation is challenging, refusing all responsibility morally is problematic. The father has a duty to the child he helped create, even if it's not desired. Legally, he can't disown the child, so his plan to avoid responsibility is not feasible and morally questionable.\n"
