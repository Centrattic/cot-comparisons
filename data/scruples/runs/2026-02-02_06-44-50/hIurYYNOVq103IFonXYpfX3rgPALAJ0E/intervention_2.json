We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion,\" which essentially means not taking any responsibility for the child. \n\nFirst, the author is a man who had a breakup with a former partner. They were using contraception but she got pregnant. He clearly stated he doesn't want kids, and now he's being asked to take responsibility. He's in a new relationship and is freaked out. He wants to disavow all rights and responsibilities, like child support and custody.\n\nLegally, I think in many places, biological fathers do have some responsibilities, even if they weren't present or wanted the child. So walking away completely might not be possible. But the user is asking if it's morally and legally okay. Legally, probably not, because paternity can be established, and the court might require child support regardless of his wishes.\n\nMorally, it's tricky. He doesn't want the child, but the child is innocent. The mother is keeping the baby, so the father's responsibility is to support it. The author is being accused of being selfish, which might be true if he's prioritizing his own comfort over the child's well-being. However, he's also stressed about his new life and the unexpected situation. But even so, the child's needs are a factor.\n\nThe ex's friends think he's selfish, but maybe they don't consider his stance. However, he did state he didn't want kids, so maybe he should have been more careful. But the fact that they used contraception suggests they were trying to prevent pregnancy. Still, the result is a child, and the author is now a parent legally and morally. So wanting to cut ties is wrong because it's abandoning a child, which is morally indefensible. Legally, he might have to pay child support unless he can relinquish parental rights, but that's usually difficult, especially if the mother wants to keep the child. \n\nSo, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because he's refusing to take responsibility for a child he fathered, which has both legal and moral implications.\n"
