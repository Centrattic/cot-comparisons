We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to avoid financial responsibility for a child they didn't want. The situation involves a past relationship where they were clear about not wanting kids, then the ex becomes pregnant, and now he's considering a \"financial abortion\" by cutting all ties and refusing support.\n\nFirst, legally, in most places, if you're the biological father, you have legal obligations for child support, regardless of wanting the child or not. The author might not be able to legally avoid that. So there's that angle.\n\nMorally, it's a bit more complex. The author was clear about not wanting kids, but the ex claims they didn't get rid of the baby because of his stance. The author is now in a new relationship and the situation is causing him stress. But the child isn't at fault here. The mother is determined to keep the child, so the father's refusal to support could be seen as selfish, especially if the mother is struggling. However, the author's initial clarity about not wanting kids is a point. But once a child is born, there's a responsibility beyond just personal desires.\n\nAlso, the author's new girlfriend might be affected by this situation, which adds another layer. The friends of the ex are calling him selfish, which could indicate social judgment. But whether that makes him an asshole morally depends on the context. If he had no role in the pregnancy (like if they used contraceptives and it failed), but still, being a parent is a responsibility once the child is born.\n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot, but legally and morally, there's an argument that he's in the wrong because he can't unilaterally decide to absolve himself of responsibility. The answer might be A, but I need to consider if the author's stance is entirely wrong. Maybe there's nuance, like if the mother is capable of raising the child without his help, but the question is about being in the wrong. The author's refusal to support could be seen as not fulfilling a duty, hence in the wrong.\n"
