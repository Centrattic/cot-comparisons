We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The author was in a relationship that seemed like it could be long-term, but they broke up and had no contact for several months. Then the ex-partner calls to say she's pregnant, and he's the father. He was very clear he never wanted kids, so this is a big problem for him. He's with a new girlfriend, moved into a new apartment, and this call has really upset him. He's considering a \"financial abortion,\" meaning he doesn't want any legal rights or responsibilities, no child support, no custody, and no contact. His ex's friends are calling him selfish, but he's struggling to handle the situation.\n\nFirst, I should look at the legal aspects. In most places, if you're the biological father, you can't just walk away from child support. Even if you don't want custody or contact, the law usually requires you to contribute financially. There might be ways to legally disclaim paternity, but only if there's evidence that you didn't know about the pregnancy or if certain conditions are met. The author mentioned that they were using contraceptives strictly, so maybe there's a legal argument there, but I think in most cases, once paternity is established (as via the tests), he's responsible. So legally, he might be in trouble if he refuses to pay.\n\nMoral standpoint is trickier. The author was clear about not wanting children, so he's not at fault for the pregnancy? But he's the biological father, so even if he was honest about his stance, the fact remains that he contributed to the child's existence. If he refuses support, that might be seen as morally wrong because the child is innocent. The mother is carrying the child, and the father has a responsibility, regardless of his current feelings. Plus, he's in a new relationship and a new living situation, but that's his life now, and he needs to take responsibility for the consequences of his actions. The ex's friends calling him selfish might be right because by walking away, he's shifting the burden entirely onto the mother and the child. \n\nBut there's also the fact that the breakup had been months prior, and they weren't in contact. Maybe the mother should have considered that when deciding to have the child. However, once the child is born, the father's obligations are typically non-negotiable. The author's refusal to have any involvement, even if the child is not his, would be different, but since paternity is confirmed, he can't just deny it. So morally, he might be seen as the asshole for not taking responsibility. \n\nAlso, the author's actions of immediately refusing without considering any alternatives (like adoption, where he might not have to be involved) could be seen as selfish. The mother is dead set on keeping the child, so he can't force her to get an abortion, but he's not working with her to find a solution where the child might not be part of his life but he still meets his responsibilities. If he's not the one wanting to have the child, maybe he's not the asshole for not wanting to be involved, but the financial responsibility is a legal obligation. \n\nSo the key points are legal responsibility and moral obligation. Legally, he's probably responsible for child support unless he can disprove paternity. Morally, it's a bit of a gray area, but many people might believe that as a father, he has a duty to support the child even if he doesn't want to be involved. The fact that he was upfront about not wanting kids might be considered, but it doesn't erase his responsibility once the child is born. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's refusing to take on a legal and moral responsibility that comes with being a parent.\n"
