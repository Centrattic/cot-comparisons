We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation again carefully.\n\nThey dated a girl for a few months, which seemed like it might be long-term, but things fell apart. They didn't talk for months, then she contacted him saying she's pregnant. He never wanted kids and was clear about that, so he's really upset. He's in a new relationship and just moved into a new apartment. He refuses to get back together or have any responsibility for the child. He wants to legally disown the child, not pay child support, etc. The mother's friends are calling him selfish and an asshole. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, from a legal standpoint, in many places, once you're the legal father, you usually have responsibilities, even if you don't want them. There's something called \"paternity\" that can't be easily waived. He might not be able to just resign his rights unless specific conditions are met, like if he wasn't involved in the child's life, but I'm not sure. But maybe the focus here is more on the moral side.\n\nMorally, it's more complicated. He was clear he didn't want kids, but they were in a relationship. Even though they broke up, if they had sex and he's the father, does he have a responsibility? Some people might say that he made a choice during the relationship that led to the pregnancy, so he's responsible. Others might argue that since he clearly stated he didn't want kids and the breakup was months ago, he shouldn't be forced into parenthood. However, abandoning the child might be seen as selfish because the child's well-being is involved, not just the parents' feelings.\n\nAlso, the fact that they used contraceptives but the pregnancy happened complicates things. If they were using them properly and it failed, maybe he's less at fault, but if they were not using them correctly, that's different. The user says they were \"fairly strict\" with contraceptives, so maybe they were using them, but there's always a small chance of failure.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. The person is clearly stressed out and doesn't want to handle this, but the mother is committed to keeping the baby. He can't force her to get an abortion or give up the child, so he's left with the responsibility. But he's refusing to take part in any way. Is this morally acceptable?\n\nThe mother's friends are upset because he's not supporting her. But the user is in a new relationship and has his own life. However, the mother is the one who has the child, so he's avoiding a responsibility he might have agreed to when he was in the relationship.\n\nIn some cultures or moral frameworks, being a responsible father is expected once you're the biological father, even if you're not the custodial parent. So, not paying child support might be seen as abandoning the child, which is wrong. However, others might argue that if he never wanted kids and was clear about it, he shouldn't be forced to support a child he didn't plan for.\n\nLegally, he might not have the option to opt out of child support. Most legal systems require financial support for children regardless of the parents' relationship status. However, if he can terminate his parental rights through the legal system, that might be possible, but it's not straightforward. Usually, terminating parental rights requires showing neglect or abandonment, and it's not a decision the parent can just make unilaterally.\n\nSo, the user is in a tough spot. Legally, he might be required to pay child support. Morally, it's debatable. Some might see him as avoiding responsibility, others might see him as being true to his stated values. However, the fact that he was in a relationship where he didn't take precautions (even though they used contraceptives) might mean he shares some responsibility. The key point is that once a child is born, the parent has obligations, even if the situation is unwanted. Therefore, the answer might depend on societal views on fatherhood and responsibility.\n\nIn summary, the user might be in the wrong morally and legally because he can't opt out of financial responsibilities unless legally able to terminate rights, and many would argue that he has a duty to the child regardless of his initial intentions.\n"
