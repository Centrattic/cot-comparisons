We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author dated a girl for a few months, and it looked like it could be a long-term relationship, but they broke up and had no contact for several months. Then the girl calls back to say she's pregnant and wants support. The author was clear they don't want kids, so they refused to get back together and hung up. Now the girl is keeping the baby, the tests confirm the author is the father, and he's trying to find a way to avoid any financial or legal responsibilities. His new girlfriend and new apartment are mentioned as part of his current stress.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they're curious to know my take. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, legally. In many jurisdictions, when a man is the legal father of a child, he is required to provide financial support, even if he's not involved in the child's life. So if the author wants to disavow all responsibility, he probably can't do that legally. He might have to go through a legal process to terminate his parental rights, which is difficult and usually requires showing that it's in the best interest of the child. Courts typically don't just allow someone to walk away from a child. So legally, he might not have a choice; he might be obligated to pay child support.\n\nMorally, this is trickier. The author didn't want children and was clear about that. However, once a child is born, the moral debate often centers around responsibility. Some people might argue that a father has a responsibility to support his child regardless of the circumstances, while others might see the author's stance as selfish, given that he had a child without wanting it. The mother might have the right to her own decisions, including not getting an abortion or adoption, and the father's responsibility is a part of that reality.\n\nAlso, the author used contraceptives, but they failed. That's a factor, but it's not uncommon for methods to fail. The fact that they had no contact for months and then the pregnancy was discovered complicates things. The mother's friends are calling him selfish, which adds to the social pressure. But is that fair? If the author never wanted to be a parent, is it wrong for him to avoid responsibility? Or is the mother's decision to keep the child the key factor here?\n\nI should consider both perspectives. The author's right to not have children and the mother's right to choose. But once the child is born, the father's responsibilities might be seen as non-negotiable, especially if the mother is committed to raising the child. So legally and morally, the author might be in the wrong for not accepting responsibility. But I also need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing, like the failure of contraceptives or the lack of contact. However, those points don't negate the legal obligations. So the answer would likely be A, but I need to be sure.\n"
