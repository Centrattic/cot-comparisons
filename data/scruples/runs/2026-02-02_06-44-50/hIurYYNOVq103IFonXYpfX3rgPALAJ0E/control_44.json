We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who had a past relationship, broke up, and now the ex is pregnant. He never wanted kids, they haven't been in contact for months, and he's refusing to have any parental responsibilities. He wants to do a \"financial abortion,\" meaning no support, no contact, no custody. The question is whether he's the asshole (option A) or not (option B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, fathers are legally obligated to provide child support once paternity is established. Even if he doesn't want to be involved, the law might require him to contribute financially. So maybe he's not legally allowed to opt out. But the user is asking about moral and legal permissibility, not just legal. However, the answer might depend on the jurisdiction, but since it's a general question, I should go with common laws in places like the US or other countries where such laws are typical.\n\nMoral aspect is trickier. He's being called selfish by the ex's friends. From a moral standpoint, some might argue that he has a responsibility as a parent, even if it's not his intention to be a parent. Others might say that since he didn't want children and the relationship ended, he's not in the wrong for not wanting to be involved. However, there's also the argument that creating life, even accidentally, comes with responsibilities. But he claims they were using contraception, so maybe the pregnancy was unexpected.\n\nThe ex is keeping the child, and he's not trying to force an abortion or adoption, which could mitigate some blame. However, he's refusing all responsibility. So is that morally acceptable? Some people might say that he's responsible for his actions and the consequences. If he had sex, even with contraception, there's a risk of pregnancy, and thus he should accept the responsibility.\n\nLegally, he can't walk away from child support in most cases. So he might not have a legal choice, but morally, it's a tougher call. The community on AITA often looks at intent and actions. He was clear about not wanting kids, but the pregnancy happened. The key points are his refusal to accept responsibility versus the ex's claim of needing support. The user's friends are calling him selfish, but he's in a new relationship and feels it's too much. \n\nIn AITA threads, the common responses often consider whether someone is being reasonable. If he's not trying to harm the child but is just avoiding responsibility, maybe the community would side with him, but others might say he's being selfish. It's a complex issue. However, the legal obligation is clear in most places, so he can't just opt out. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not wrong legally, but is seen as morally wrong, then the answer might be A or B depending on the perspective. But since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the community often takes a middle ground, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's not forcing the ex to get an abortion and is upfront about his stance, even if he's legally obligated. But I'm a bit confused. Maybe the answer is A because he's not taking responsibility for the child, which is expected. Hmm.\n"
