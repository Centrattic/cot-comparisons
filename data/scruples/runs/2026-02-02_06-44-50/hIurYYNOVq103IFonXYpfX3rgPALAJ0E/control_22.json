We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario is about a man who had a brief relationship, broke up, then was told he's going to be a father. He never wanted kids, and after the breakup, they didn't talk for months. The girl is now pregnant and wants him involved, but he's refusing any responsibility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, fathers have legal obligations to their children, including child support, even if they don't want to be involved. So wanting to disown the child financially might not be legally possible. Legally, he might be required to pay child support regardless of his feelings.\n\nMorally, this is more complex. People have different views on this. Some might say that once a child is born, the parent has a responsibility, even if the pregnancy was unexpected. Others might argue that since he never wanted the child and the pregnancy happened after the relationship ended, he shouldn't be obligated. But society often places a duty on biological parents to support their children.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If being in the wrong means being morally or legally at fault. Legally, he might be at fault if he doesn't fulfill his obligations. Morally, it's debatable. He's being called selfish by the ex's friends, but he also has his life and new relationship to consider.\n\nHe's not forcing the mother to get an abortion, so he's respecting her right to carry the baby. But he's not wanting any part in the child's life. Is that morally wrong? Some might say yes, because children need both parents, even if the relationship is over. Others might say he's honest about his preferences, and the mother should know his stance upfront.\n\nBut legally, he can't opt out of financial responsibility. So if the question is about legal wrong, then yes, he's in the wrong because he can't just resign rights. If it's about moral wrong, it's more subjective. However, the mother might have a case if she's seeking support. The author is choosing to avoid responsibility, which could be seen as selfish, but if he's acting within his rights morally, maybe not. However, typically, child support is seen as a responsibility, so morally, he might still be considered in the wrong.\n\nSo the answer might depend on whether it's legal or moral. The question is phrased as \"in the wrong,\" which could mean both. Since legally he can't just opt out, and morally many would argue he's responsible, the answer is likely A (he is in the wrong).\n"
