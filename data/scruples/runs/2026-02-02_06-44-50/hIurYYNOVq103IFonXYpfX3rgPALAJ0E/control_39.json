We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about an unexpected pregnancy after a breakup, and the author wanting to avoid any financial or parental responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, when a man is identified as the father, he's legally obligated to provide child support, regardless of his willingness. So the author's idea of a \"financial abortion\" might not be legally feasible. They can't just resign their rights that easily. Legally, they might be on shaky ground here.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The author was in a relationship and had a child with someone they broke up with. The woman is keeping the baby, so the child exists. The author's stance is that they don't want to be involved at all, financially or otherwise. But from a moral perspective, some might argue that the child deserves support from both parents. The author's refusal could be seen as selfish, especially if the mother is struggling economically. However, the author was clear about not wanting kids, so maybe they're being honest about their own limits.\n\nThe woman's friends are calling the author selfish, which adds social pressure. But does that mean the author is wrong? Not necessarily. It's a matter of differing values. The author is prioritizing their own mental health and new relationship, which is understandable. Still, the child's well-being is a factor here. If the mother can't support the child alone, the father's support might be necessary.\n\nAnother angle: the author is in shock and stress, which affects their judgment. They might not be considering all the implications. But legally, they might have to face child support regardless. So their desire to avoid it might not be realistic, making them wrong in thinking it's a viable option.\n\nAlso, the use of contraceptives didn't work, but that's part of life. Both parties might share some responsibility. The author can't force an abortion or adoption, so their hands are tied there. But the financial part is a point of contention. If the law requires support, then the author's stance is against the law, which could make them wrong.\n\nSo, combining legal and moral aspects, the author is likely in the wrong because legally they can't avoid support, and morally, some would say they have a responsibility. However, there are arguments for their stress and honesty about not wanting kids. But since the question is whether they're in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A (Yes).\n"
