A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the woman) is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. Let me consider the details.\n\nFirst, the couple planned to get massages together. The woman chose a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female one for herself. The boyfriend then refuses, saying massages are inherently sexual and he won't accept a male masseuse. The woman tries to understand his reasoning but he accuses her of being argumentative and not just canceling the appointment.\n\nSo, the key points here are autonomy and communication. The woman made a choice without consulting him, which might have been a mistake because personal preferences about bodywork are important. But he also reacted strongly, refusing to compromise even when she offered to switch. His claim that massages are inherently sexual seems a bit odd, but it might be his personal discomfort. She tried to understand his logic and offered a solution, but he dismissed her and wanted to cancel entirely. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she scheduled him with a male masseuse without checking with him first. That could be seen as overstepping, especially since personal boundaries in a massage are important. However, she tried to resolve the issue by offering to switch. His response was to walk away and cancel, which is also problematic because it shuts down communication.\n\nBut the question is whether she's at fault. Maybe she should have asked for his preference first. However, he also didn't handle the situation well. The main issue is that she made a decision without his input, which is a common point of conflict. On the other hand, his reaction is extreme. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's preferences is key. She might not be entirely wrong because he was dismissive, but she could have been more considerate in her initial decision. So, it's a bit of a toss-up. But the question is if she's in the wrong. The answer might lean towards B (No) because she tried to address his concerns and he didn't handle it well. However, some might argue she should have asked first. But the fact that she offered to switch shows she's trying to accommodate, so maybe she's not wrong.\n"
