  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple booking massages together. The author, a female, scheduled her boyfriend with a male masseuse and herself with a female. The boyfriend is upset because he finds male masseurs sexual, and he thinks the author is being argumentative. She tried to understand his reasoning but he said she's wrong and made her feel like she's turning it into an argument. The author is now going to go without him.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The main issue is about comfort with massage gender. The boyfriend has a strong discomfort with male masseurs, calling massages inherently sexual. The author thinks it's therapeutic and was trying to understand his reasoning. She even offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel. Now she's going alone.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the author made a choice that the boyfriend was uncomfortable with. Even if she had good intentions, not considering his comfort might be an issue. But she did try to discuss and switch, which shows she's not being inconsiderate. The boyfriend's reaction seems a bit extreme, especially since he was okay with a female masseuse. Also, he called her arguments irrational, which could be dismissive. \n\nThe author's actions: She scheduled based on availability, which is neutral. She tried to understand his perspective, offered solutions. The boyfriend's stance is that massages are sexual, which is a personal belief. However, in a relationship, respecting each other's comfort levels is important. The author didn't force him to go; he chose to cancel. The author is proceeding without him, which is her right. \n\nIs she in the wrong? She tried to accommodate, but the boyfriend's discomfort is his own issue. If the author had insisted without listening, that would be wrong. But here, she tried to reason and switch. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own feelings than her actions. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
