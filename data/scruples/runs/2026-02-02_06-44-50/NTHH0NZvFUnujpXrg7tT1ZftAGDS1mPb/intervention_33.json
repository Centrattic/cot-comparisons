  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The scenario is that they both wanted massages, and she chose different genders for each of them. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse, saying massages are inherently sexual, while she thinks they're therapeutic.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The woman scheduled based on available options, maybe assuming it's okay. The boyfriend's discomfort is valid, right? People have different boundaries and comfort levels. The fact that he's not comfortable with a male masseuse, even in a monogamous relationship, could be due to personal feelings about body exposure or the nature of the massage itself. She offered to switch, but he said to cancel, and she went ahead without him.\n\nIs her initial action wrong? Well, she didn't consider his possible discomfort beforehand. Maybe she should have checked with him first. But she might have thought it's a neutral choice. He felt it was sexual, which she disagreed with, leading to an argument. She tried to understand his reasoning, but he dismissed her and canceled. She went without him, which he might see as her being stubborn.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. She might have made an assumption about his comfort level. However, her intention was to facilitate the activity they both wanted. He's the one who's uncomfortable, so she's not necessarily in the wrong, but maybe she could have been more considerate upfront. However, the boyfriend's reaction to cancel seems a bit extreme. She offered to switch, but he wouldn't budge. She went ahead, which he might see as pushing despite his discomfort.\n\nBut the question is whether she is in the wrong. Since she made a choice that he was uncomfortable with, but she tried to resolve it, maybe she's not entirely at fault. On the other hand, maybe she should have checked with him first. But she didn't know he had such a strong opinion. It's a bit of a toss-up. In AITA scenarios, sometimes the person who takes initiative without considering the other's feelings is seen as the asshole, but sometimes it's about respecting boundaries. Since he's the one who has the personal boundary about massage gender, and she tried to accommodate (offered to switch), but he refused, maybe she's in the right. However, if she had asked first, it might have avoided the issue. But she didn't know his stance. Hmm. Maybe she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
